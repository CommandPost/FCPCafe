### Our To-Do List

If you're interested in collaborating, and helping FCP Cafe grow, here's some ideas of some of the things you can do:

- Make sure all your Final Cut Pro feature requests are added to our [Wish List](https://fcp.cafe/wishlist/).
- Make sure all your Final Cut Pro bug reports are added to our [Bug Tracker](https://fcp.cafe/bugtracker/).
- If you've worked on a professional product (feature film, short film, television commercial, television series, etc), consider writing a case study.
- Add information to our [FAQ](https://fcp.cafe/faq/). There's a list of things on our TODO list as comments in the [Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/main/docs/faq.md){target="_blank"}.
- Add any missing [Motion Templates](https://fcp.cafe/motiontemplates/), [Tools](https://fcp.cafe/tools/) and [Plugins](https://fcp.cafe/plugins/).
- Add personalised reviews to any [Motion Templates](https://fcp.cafe/motiontemplates/), [Tools](https://fcp.cafe/tools/) and [Plugins](https://fcp.cafe/plugins/) you use regularly.
- Expand the [Motion Templates](https://fcp.cafe/motiontemplates/) page. For example, rather than just having one section for [MotionVFX](https://fcp.cafe/motiontemplates/#motionvfx), we should also list their best/most useful products.

### What's a Pull Request?

Imagine you're working with a group of friends on a big school project, and you're all adding different parts to it. Now, you're all using the same master copy of the project, but you're all working separately. When you're ready to add your part to the master copy, you don't just want to plop it in there. You want your friends to check it over, make sure it fits with everything else, and then add it in when they agree it's ready. This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.

A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or "project," you often work on your own copy, or "branch". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a "pull request". This is a proposal that says "I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project".

Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they "merge" them into the shared project. This way, everyone keeps the code clean and organized, and you have a record of who added what and when.

So, in simple terms, **a pull request is a way of proposing changes to a shared project** and allowing others to review and approve those changes before they're added.

### How to Edit Pages

If you're not already registered with GitHub, [create a free account](https://github.com/join){target="_blank"}.

There's an **Edit this page on GitHub** link at the bottom of every page.

![Edit this file](../static/editthispage.png)

You can edit the contents of this page by clicking the link at the bottom of this page.

To make changes simply click the little pencil **Edit this file** button.

![Edit this file](../static/editthisfile.png)

You can then make changes in the text editor using the Markdown syntax. Copying and pasting existing syntax is the best way to get started.

You should make sure all external links open in a new tab/window (edit this page to see how that works).

If you're modifying a list of Tools or Workflow Extensions, everything should be sorted in alphabetical order.

You can learn more about basic formatting [here](https://retype.com/guides/formatting/){target="_blank"}.

![Edit this file](../static/editor.png)

Once done click **Commit changes**. You can enter a message and description for the commit. Press **Commit changes** again.

![Edit this file](../static/proposechanges.png)

You will now be presented with a **Open a pull request** page.

You can add a title and detailed description to the pull request. Once you're done click **Create pull request**.

![Edit this file](../static/pullrequest.png)

This will send your changes to the FCP Cafe team to review and approve.

If changes are required, they'll add comments within the pull request.

If you have questions, you can ask them on the [Discussions board](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/discussions){target="_blank"}.

You can also email us here: [support@latenitefilms.com](mailto:support@latenitefilms.com?subject=FCPCafe)

### GitHub Web-based Editor

You can use the [github.dev](https://github.dev){target="_blank"} web-based editor to edit files and commit your changes.

Simply replace the `.com` with `.dev` on any GitHub URL.

For example to edit this page you can use:

```
https://github.dev/CommandPost/FCPCafe/blob/main/docs/contribute.md
```

You can learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor).

### External Links

All external links should open in a new tab/window.

The trick is to add `{target="_blank"}` at the end of the link.

Here's an example of how to do this in Markdown:

```
[Sync-N-Link](https://fcp.cafe/tools/#sync-n-link-x){target="_blank"}
```

---

### Embedded Videos

To keep that site as fast as possible, and free from tracking/cookies, we've decided **not** to allow embedded videos.

Instead, we'll be posting the Video Thumbnail as a clickable link to the video.

Here's an example of how this looks in Markdown:

```
[![](/static/caption-converter.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VOY70LfA-4){target="_blank"}
```

You can use [this website](https://youtube-thumbnail-grabber.com){target="_blank"} for download YouTube Thumbnails.

---

### Images

All images should be stored within the `/docs/static/` folder on GitHub.

You can find it [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/tree/main/docs/static){target="_blank"}.

---

### GitHub Desktop

You can also use GitHub Desktop to essentially "clone" the entire FCP Cafe website to your local machine.

You can then make changes locally, and once done, submit a pull request back to the main GitHub repository.

You can download GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com){target="_blank"}.

You can then use a text editor like [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/){target="_blank"} to edit your Markdown files on your Mac.
