### What's a Pull Request?

Imagine you're working with a group of friends on a big school project, and you're all adding different parts to it. Now, you're all using the same master copy of the project, but you're all working separately. When you're ready to add your part to the master copy, you don't just want to plop it in there. You want your friends to check it over, make sure it fits with everything else, and then add it in when they agree it's ready. This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.

A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or "project," you often work on your own copy, or "branch". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a "pull request". This is a proposal that says "I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project".

Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they "merge" them into the shared project. This way, everyone keeps the code clean and organized, and you have a record of who added what and when.

So, in simple terms, **a pull request is a way of proposing changes to a shared project** and allowing others to review and approve those changes before they're added.

### YouTube & Vimeo Embeds

To keep that site as fast as possible, and free from tracking/cookies, we've decided not to allow embedded videos.

Instead, we'll be posting the Video Thumbnail as a clickable link to the video.
