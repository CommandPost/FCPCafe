FCP Cafe is entirely open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You can make changes to the site by [submitting pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe).

We welcome and encourage users submitting their own case studies, articles and products.

The entire site is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), so it's very easy to modify and update without knowing any HTML or code.
