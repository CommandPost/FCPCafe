A directory of Final Cut Pro Plugins (FxPlug4).

We're big fans of everything [CoreMelt](https://coremelt.com) & [Motion VFX](https://www.motionvfx.com) do.

!!!
**IMPORTANT:** The recent Final Cut Pro v10.6.6 update has removed compatibility for all FxPlug3 based plugins immediately and without warning. This is true both for Intel Macs, as well as Apple Silicon Macs running Rosetta 2. Former workarounds are no longer viable, and opening a Library in Final Cut Pro v10.6.6 will force an update, making that library incompatible with previous versions of Final Cut Pro.
