!!!
**IMPORTANT:** The recent FCP 10.6.6 Update has removed compatibility for all FxPlug3 based plugins immediately and without warning. This is true both for Intel Macs, as well as Apple Silicon Macs running Rosetta 2. Former workarounds are no longer viable, and opening a Library in FCP 10.6.6 will force an update, making that library incompatible with previous versions of FCP.

## [SliceX](https://coremelt.com/products/slicex-powered-by-mocha)

SliceX lets you quickly create tracked Shape Masks to cut out layers or isolate effects. SliceX powered by mocha takes the pain out of following complex motion, just draw a shape and hit track.
