**Scott Simmons** has updated his ProVideo Coalition article:

- [Final Cut Pro 10.7 has shipped (UPDATED 12/11/23) and export segmentation might speed things up for you](https://www.provideocoalition.com/final-cut-pro-10-7-has-shipped/)

It's worth a read to hear more details about how to speed up exports with simultaneous processing in Final Cut Pro for Mac.

You can also read about it in the Final Cut Pro manual [here](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/final-cut-pro/verd006aab15/10.7/mac/13.5).
