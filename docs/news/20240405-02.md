**Iain Anderson** has released a new set of Motion Templates for Final Cut Pro called **Emojisplosion** on FxFactory.

> Emojisplosion is the easiest way to add hundreds of emoji-based particles to your videos. You can make them sit behind a title, enhance a background or make a magic wand sparkle.
>
> Emojisplosion gives you all the flexibility you need, without the complexity of a full particle system. It's perfect for educational, social media and sports videos, and ready for portrait or landscape videos. Most of the particles here are packaged as titles, but emoji-based transitions are included too.

It's currently on sale for **USD$39** for a limited time (before increasing to USD$59). There is also a free trial.
