**Undocumented Fixes:**

The Command Set Import window now only accepts `.commandset` files! This was reported as [FB12868396](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/236). Thanks Apple!

The relink progress bar has been improved, so that the progress bar doesn't "block" the Relink panel interface. This means that as things relink in the progress bar, you can visually see things get removed in the matched files list.
