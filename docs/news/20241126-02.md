**Julie Eckersley** and **Dr Austin Hayden** have written a manifesto for creating high-quality, low cost television for the Digital Age, titled **FREESTYLE TV**.

I had the honour of writing a couple of pages about my personal thoughts/opinions on what Producers should know about Post Production.

You can [download the PDF and have a read via the FREESTYLE TV website](https://www.expandingmedia.org/freestyletv).
