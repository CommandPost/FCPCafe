Existing Color Finale Transcoder v1.0 users can upgrade at a discounted rate (check your emails).

There's also a fully featured **7-day free trial**, so you can try before you buy.

This new version includes:

- Nikon N-RAW support
- Edit BRAW and N-RAW clips on the timeline without transcoding
- Create movies out of raw images from stills cameras
- Use without Final Cut Pro as a standalone app

You can read more about this update in more detail on their [blog](https://colorfinale.com/blog/post/cft2-announcement-05-24).

We've been testing out the initial v2.0.0 release, and there's a few things to keep in mind when using the new **Use Original Media** feature:

- Whatever you set as your **Resolution** in the Workflow Extension is what is used as your clip's resolution. For example, if your BRAW clip is `6144 x 3456`, if you have **1/2 (3072x1728)** selected in the Workflow Extension's Inspector prior to importing, the clip that's imported into the Final Cut Pro will be `3072 x 1728`. Whilst there is a **Resolution** dropdown in the **BRAWReader** effect on the clip, so you can adjust the decode quality - the source clip will always still be `3072 x 1728`, which could be a quality issue if you want to access the full image data or want to send a `FCPXML` to DaVinci Resolve. For now, I'd recommend importing everything at **Full Resolution**.
- We've found that whilst clips generally play back perfectly in the timeline, on some clips in the Browser it won't play back the images correctly. For example, on a 45min clip, in the Browser the first 30mins is stuck on the first frame - however it plays perfectly in the timeline. This same issue happened when adding these same clips to a Synchronised Clip. This is hopefully just a simple bug that can be fixed in a future update.
- Applying speed effects to clips directly doesn't work. For example, if you a 25fps BRAW clip in a 25fps timeline, if you apply a **Fast 2x** effect, you just get a freeze frame. However you can workaround this by creating a Compound Clip, or putting the clip into a Synchronised Clip or Multicam first.
- There's currently no way to re-link BRAW/N-RAW files - if the file path has changed, it will just show missing media. As a workaround, you could export a `FCPXML` and do a find and replace of the file path.

- There was a few times during testing with speed effects that Final Cut Pro reported **Cannot perform this operation. The application detected an error that prevents changes from being saved. To avoid losing your work, quit Final Cut Pro.**. This is something we've never really come across, and we're not exactly sure what's triggering this, but will keep investigating.

- There was a few times when working with N-RAW that frames would fail to render, and we would get an error like the below. N-RAW seems to require a lot more CPU/GPU strength than BRAW.

- We tested moving projects from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve, and it works well, however you'll have to manually **Replace Selected Clip...** to force relink to the original BRAW file.
- We tried working with several BRAW and N-RAW clips in a Multicam and it worked well.

Given that Color Finale Transcoder can already transcode ARRIRAW and CinemaDNG, it'll be interesting to see if we'll be able to **Use Original Media** for these formats too in a future update.
