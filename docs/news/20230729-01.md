**Kino AI** for Mac is out now as a public beta!

Kino is an AI assistant for tracking footage metadata and organizing your media assets.

Automatically index your footage and search your library with natural language. No cloud required.

Currently it only exports to Adobe Premiere, however Final Cut Pro support is on the roadmap.

We've been testing it out, and it's very handy. It uses everyone's favourite [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), and [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) under the hood.

You can watch a demonstration here:
