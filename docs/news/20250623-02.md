**FidelityFuze** has been announced over at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/comments/1lfin6y/built_a_native_final_cut_pro_plugin_for_realtime/), in a post titled **Built a native Final Cut Pro plugin for real-time upscaling – 1080p, 4K, even 8K directly in the timeline**.

The developer **Sebastian Krogull** has already had HUGE interest in the product, which is currently at release candidate stage, in final beta testing.

I've had a chance to download and play - and it's very impressive.

Sebastian will post a developers case study over at FCP Cafe after launch!

Noting that Sebastian says:

> Note: These are preview versions of the final website. FidelityFuze hasn’t launched yet – it’s still in early access. I’m building it solo and working to make sure everything is solid. DM me or reply here if you’d like to try it – or just share your thoughts.

We'll post more in the coming weeks!
