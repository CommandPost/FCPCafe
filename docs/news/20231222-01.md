**Final Cut Pro 10.7.1** is out now!

This release includes:

- Improves stability on Intel-based Mac models when using Color Wheels or Color Curves on H.264 video clips (reported on FCP Cafe [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/299)).
- Fixes an issue with some default keyboard shortcuts working incorrectly on non-English keyboards.

Thanks for the fast turnaround Apple!

We'll test it over the coming days and weeks to see if there's any other undocumented changes/fixes.
