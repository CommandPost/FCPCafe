From the team behind Audio Design Design, **SoundGen** is a generative AI experience that turns your text prompts into music and art, with the option to download the files and add them into your film and audio projects.

The beta program is entirely free for you to use and experiment with. As SoundGen matures, the developers will be integrating it directly into **Audio Design Desk**.

Their goal is to give their users access to an even broader collection of sounds on demand, right within the DAW.

The alpha version can only do a maximum of 30 seconds. Depending on the prompt, sometimes it can found great, other times it's very computer generated. It'll definitely improve dramatically over time!

You can [sign up](https://music.makr.ai/).
