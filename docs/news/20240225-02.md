**Producer's Best Friend v1.4.69** is out now!

It includes the following changes:

- **New feature:** Preferences checkbox to keep thumbnail images (instead of having them automatically deleted)
- Bug fix to alert for `fcpxmld` bundles exported incorrectly as a "Final Cut Pro Document" instead of "Final Cut Pro XML Bundle"
