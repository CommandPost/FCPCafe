There are some exciting updates from **iodyne**!

Their new Firmware Boosts Blackmagic Disk Speed Writes up to **2X faster**!

Pro Data is the world’s fastest Thunderbolt storage, but that doesn’t stop their world-class engineering team from trying to make it even better!

Their new firmware release boosts BlackMagic Disk Speed Test write performance up to **2.3GB/s** (up to **2X faster** than before), further improving Pro Data's performance and out-of-box experience on widely-used industry tools.

The new 1.4 firmware release will ship in November to all Pro Data customers, downloadable free from the iodyne Utility. And it will be pre-installed on new shipments after that date.

They also added nifty UI improvements, and even more intelligence to their app: iodyne Utility can now detect and report a defective Thunderbolt cable, or invalid cabling configurations.
