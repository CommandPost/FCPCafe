**FidelityFuze v2.6.0** is out now!

It includes the following changes:

- Detail Recovery now honors human color perception. Previous versions measured color differences in RGB, a model built for screens, not for eyes. RGB treats every channel equally. Human vision does not. We notice some shifts more than others. We see edges where contrast matters to us, not where mathematics says it should. This release aligns the algorithm with how we actually see. The stubborn remnants that occasionally surfaced during detail extraction lose more of their foothold. Faint halos, shimmer, stair-stepping. Previous releases pushed these into the margins. This one pushes further. What you get is cleaner detail, more stable edges, and images that hold together under scrutiny.
- Detail extraction reaches deeper into the image, pulling out texture and subtlety that was harder to access before, while edges stay locked. Transitions between detail and noise are smooth and predictable, so subtle frame-to-frame variations no longer compound into flicker.
- Detail Recovery now adds dimensionality that invites your eye to wander. Foreground and background each find their own presence. Especially when upscaling from 4K or higher. Grab your action cam footage from that mountain pass, that coastline, that road trip. Throw in some supersampling. And feel like you're there again. If your footage is well-lit and clean, try pushing Detail Sensitivity higher while easing back on Detail Recovery. The new algorithm won't punish you for it.
- Updated to FxPlug SDK `v4.3.4` for seamless Final Cut Pro 12 support.
