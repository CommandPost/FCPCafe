**CommandPost v2.0.0** is out now! 🥳

![](/static/commandpost-v2-0-0.png)

**CommandPost v2** requires at least ONE paid LateNite App installed.

After 9 years of free updates, to ensure that CommandPost continues to be developed, improved, and stay open-source, we've decided that you need at least ONE paid LateNite application installed to use CommandPost moving forward - consider it "inner circle" software (i.e. only our mates get access to it).

Thank you to **EVERYONE** who has supported CommandPost throughout these years!

To use CommandPost v2 (and later) please download and install at least ONE LateNite App from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/developer/latenite-films-pty-ltd/id1652018641) **OR** roll back to a previous version of CommandPost v1.

This release has the following changes:

**🔨 Improvements:**
- Added support for **Final Cut Pro Creator Studio** (subscription).
- Added support for FCPXML `v1.14`.

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed Effects Browser actions in **Final Cut Pro v12**.

You can download and learn more on the [CommandPost website](https://commandpost.fcp.cafe).
