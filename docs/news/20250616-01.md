**ATEM Exporter** has been reduced from **USD$150** to a one-time payment of **USD$79.99** on the Mac App Store. ðŸ¥³

After posting about ATEM Exporter on the Facebook [Blackmagic ATEM Mini User-group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/666156180950487), which has over 60K members, I started to receive a lot of DM's and emails with interest in the software.

For those that don't know, **ATEM Exporter** is a native Swift + Swift UI Mac Application that listens to a [Blackmagic ATEM switcher](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atem), and logs all the camera changes.

You can export the camera changes as a Final Cut Pro `FCPXML`, to use in Final Cut Pro or Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve.

You can export a **Program Cut**, which allows you to use your program feed from an external recorder (such as a [Blackmagic HyperDeck](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/hyperdeck)), and add cut points each time there's a camera change.

You can also export a **Multicam**, which allows you to use your program feed as well as any ISO (i.e. independent camera) recordings, and export a Multicam clip for Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve.

ATEM Exporter was built in a few hours during a live event, and at release it had **only** been tested in a real-world live production using an **Blackmagic ATEM Constellation 8K**, Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs.

Since release, we've had quite a few users test it on all kinds of ATEM's.

Originally I was thinking that this would be a very niche, high-end tool - i.e. for people with expensive Blackmagic ATEM Constellation 8K's.

However, after posting to the Facebook group I realised just how many people have and use ATEMs for all kinds of things - especially at the lower budget in schools, universities, places of faith, etc.

As a result, I decided to reduce the price, and also release a quick and dirty demo video that I originally threw together late at night for Apple's Mac App Store Review.

You can watch it here:

</div>

Hope this helps!

Whilst I've got you... here's a sneak peak at our upcoming **SplitTake** icon by the AMAZING [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com):

He's also put together a "placeholder" icon for LateNite apps we still have in development:
