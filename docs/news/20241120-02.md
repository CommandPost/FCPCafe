**BRAW Toolbox v1.4.1 (71)** is out now.

It includes the following improvements:

- Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v4.3 to v4.3.1.
- Updated from FxPlug v4.3 to v4.3.1.
- Improved Blackmagic RAW SDK stability with simultaneous decodes.

Whilst Apple did announce at the 2024 Final Cut Pro Creative Summit that **Final Cut Pro 11** now supports the new macOS system-wide [MediaExtension Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaextension), and that Blackmagic will at some point release a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension - there is currently no time frame, so we have no idea if this is coming in days, weeks, or months.

In [2023](https://x.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1667015417175625734) Apple announced a new framework called **MediaExtension**, that provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesnâ€™t natively support - such as **Blackmagic RAW** and **Nikon NRAW**.

This was supposed to come in **macOS Sonoma**, but they silently killed it - only for it to reappear in this years WWDC for **macOS Sequoia**.

Whilst it's been out for a while, the documentation is insanely complicated and limited and the only person I know who's done ANYTHING with it so far is the incredible [Anton Marini](https://x.com/_vade), who's been building an **ffmpeg** Media Extension over on GitHub [here](https://github.com/vade/FFMPEGMediaExtension).

I originally started playing with and testing MediaExtension's both back in 2023, and during the macOS Sequoia beta's, but never made much progress, as Final Cut Pro 10.8.1 didn't support Media Extensions anyway.

However, given there's no certainty as to when Blackmagic will release a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension, we're going to go back and see if we can bring a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension to market sooner rather than later.

Apple announced 3rd party Motion Templates were "coming soon" to iPad at launch, and that functionality is still not out - so we don't really want to waste time waiting for something that could be a year away.

We'll continue to keep you posted on our progress on FCP Cafe.
