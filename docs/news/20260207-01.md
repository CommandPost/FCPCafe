**Logic Pro v12.0.1** and **Logic Pro Creator Studio v12.0.1** are out now!

This update includes stability improvements and bug fixes.

This is the first time we've seen an update for any Creator Studio apps, and it's pretty clear that the Logic Team is still the king of ProApps - with the fastest bug fix turnaround.

There's quite a few bugs and crashes in **Final Cut Pro v12**, so HOPEFULLY we see the Final Cut Pro team push out a bug fix update soon too!

If you haven't updated yet, please check our [Update Guide](/update-guide/).

You can learn more and download Logic Pro from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/logic-pro/id634148309).
