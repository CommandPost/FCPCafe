**Final Cut Pro v1.0.1** for iPad is out now!

The only change according the release notes is:

- Fixes an issue where the validation of third-party Audio Unit Extensions prevented Final Cut Pro for iPad from opening.

You can find the [release note on FCP Cafe](/releasenotes/#final-cut-pro-101-for-ipad). We'll update that page if we find anything undocumented.
