Happy Friday!

Apple today [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/01/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/) financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2026, which corresponds to the fourth calendar quarter of 2025.

> All-time records for total company revenue and EPS iPhone and Services revenue reach new all-time highs

> The Company posted quarterly revenue of $143.8 billion, up 16 percent year over year. Diluted earnings per share was $2.84, up 19 percent year over year.

Yikes. Apple have a LOT of money.

As reported yesterday, **CommandPost** currently works in **Final Cut Pro v12** (lifetime/perpetual), but doesn't yet support **Final Cut Pro Creator Studio v12** (subscription).

However, if you're DESPERATE to get CommandPost up-and-running with the subscription version of Final Cut Pro, you can check out [these required Lua changes](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/commit/fc64b78521141cbd85550eaabccd981c5babb38f).

I'll try and push out a CommandPost update ASAP - there's a few weird performance issues with Final Cut Pro v12 that I still want to try and improve. Stay tuned!
