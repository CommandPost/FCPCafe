**NAB Show 2024** (National Association of Broadcasters) has officially been and gone.

Starting on Sunday 14th April, it took place at it's usual home in the Las Vegas Convention Center, and over the four days it had over **61,000 attendees**.

Interestingly, it's been reported that 54% of the registered attendees were first-time visitors.

Whilst there was no Final Cut Pro update, nor any news about Final Cut Pro directly from Apple, there was some interesting news for the Final Cut Pro community.

The highlights being:

The [Atomos Ninja Phone](https://www.atomos.com/explore/ninja-phone/) also looks quite interesting.

As always, the [Blackmagic Design NAB 2024 Update video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCyp7lJYRlE) is worth watching. Blackmagic had a HUGE amount of product announcements as usual.

Larry Jordan has a [large collection of videos](https://larryjordan.com/articles/nab-show-2024-exhibitor-interviews/) from the show floor that's worth watching.
