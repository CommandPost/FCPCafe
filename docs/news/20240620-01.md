**Rotomatic v1.0.0** is out now on FxFactory.

It features:

> **Automatic object detection and tracking**
> Rotomatic simplifies the tedious task of manual rotoscoping by automating it, offering significant control to achieve desired results with convenience and speed. Developed using a contemporary machine learning framework, Rotomatic employs multiple neural networks to enhance object detection and tracking.
>
> **Intuitive on-screen configuration**
> Intuitive, on-screen configuration for efficient and practical rotoscoping application. Our "Refine, not Redo" philosophy means that labor-intensive steps like object definition and tracking are seldom repeated. The built-in timeline facilitates management of keyframes and selected objects, especially for extensive clips requiring rotoscoping.
>
> **Incremental refinement**
> Keyframes, objects, and their elements can be adjusted and reprocessed without impacting previously computed outcomes. Rotomatic offers a more efficient and user-friendly way to achieve professional rotoscoping results.
