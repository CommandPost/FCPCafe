**Final Cut Camera v2.0.1** is out now with the following improvements:

- Includes support for 30 additional languages.
- Includes stability and performance improvements.

The additional languages is a great sign that maybe we'll see addition languages in Final Cut Pro for Mac & iPad in the not-so-distant future!

You can download and learn more on the [iPhone App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/final-cut-camera/id6469552837).
