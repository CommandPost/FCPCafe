**Media Sync Tool v8.9** is out now on the Mac App Store.

It has the following improvements:

- The proxy media workflow has been drastically simplified.
- Media Sync Tool now syncs your proxy media the same way as the originals, eliminating the previous necessity to use the complex workaround.
- You no longer have to use the 'Force Sync' keyword - this option has been removed completely.
- The option to add a source metadata FCPXML is now removed too, as it is became unnecessary.

You can download on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/media-sync-tool/id1559556642).
