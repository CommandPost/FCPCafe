**Audio Design Desk v2.1.3** is out now!

It includes the following changes:

- Track automation wasn't blocking mouse events on regions beneath, so it made it impossible to drag automation points
- More region mouse event improvements and fixes
- Improvements and fixes to Audio Unit manager UI for enabling and disabling Audio Units
- Epidemic login button would be disabled if you canceled out of the web login forcing an ADD restart to reenable it
- Audio tables wasn't updating with correct count after searching
- Dragging multiple files from the library tables would result in overlapped regions in the timeline. Now, they will stack by default on new tracks, but you can hold the shift key to have them placed sequentially in a row
- Misc UI fixes
