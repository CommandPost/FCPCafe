**CommandPost v2.0.4** is out now!

![](/static/commandpost-2-0-4.png)

It includes the following changes:

**🔨 Improvements**
- **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** and **Scan the Menubars of the Active Application** are now enabled by default on a fresh install, to avoid confusion for new users. These were originally disabled by default to make a fresh install of CommandPost launch as quickly as possible - however it confuses too many new users.

**🐞 Bug Fix**
- Fixed all actions that used the **Reveal in Browser** menubar item, including the **Reveal in Browser and Highlight** action in Final Cut Pro v11.1. This menubar item has been renamed in to **Reveal Source in Browser** in Final Cut Pro v11.1. Thanks for reporting Johnny!
