**FxPlug v4.3.3** is out now! ü•≥

FxPlug is the effects engine for Apple's Motion and Final Cut Pro.

It includes the following improvements and bug fixes:

- FxPlug SDK is now supported on machines running macOS 11.0 and above.
- Added ability for plug-ins to close a remote window.
- Added tagged pop-up menus so that plug-ins can rearrange the items or add new items between existing items without having to change their parameter handling code.
- Added compatibility with older versions of Final Cut Pro, Motion and Compressor and support for macOS 11.0 and above.
- OpenGL is deprecated. Please update your plugins to work with Metal.
- Fixed an issue that would cause dynamically registered FxPlugs to not load during a ‚ÄúSend To Compressor‚Äù event.
- Fixed an issue where anamorphic footage was improperly cropped during analysis.
- Fixed an issue where the `FxCustomParameterAPI‚Äôs -currentTime` method could return an invalid time.
- Deprecated the `-[FxImageTile openGLTextureForContext:]` method.

You can download FxPlug on the [Apple Developer Downloads website](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=FxPlug).

We'll look into updating BRAW Toolbox and Gyroflow Toolbox ASAP.
