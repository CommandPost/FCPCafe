November is RAPIDLY approaching, and if you haven't already considered going to the **FCP Creative Summit** you DEFINITELY should.

There's some great speakers in the mix, but probably most exciting:

> **Fitness+ How We Use Final Cut Pro**<br />
> **Speaker:** Apple Fitness+ Team

Last year at the Summit Apple told us:

> One interesting point to note is that even though the Scary Fast event wasn't cut in Final Cut Pro (yes, it was cut in Premiere) - everything for Apple Fitness+ is - over 4,700 videos, 15 hours every week, all cut in Final Cut Pro using ProRes. Apple is eating their own dog food, at a major scale. Also, all the WWDC talks this year were cut in Final Cut Pro.

They also hinted that they were doing some special/funky metadata stuff for Fitness+ but didn't go into any deep details - so HOPEFULLY we learn more this year.

There will be LOTS of new tech discussed at the event.

**MotionVFX** has just released a tonne of new products, which I'm sure everyone will be talking about.

**Wes Plate** from **Automatic Duck** will be presenting - so we can all safely assume he'll announce something amazing (I wonder if you can guess what it is!).

Of course, **Michael Cioni** from **Strada** will be doing a keynote talk, **Bet on the Future, bet on Yourself**. Michael is one of the best public speakers in our industry, so his talks are always amazing.

I'm also currently helping **Arthur Moore** of [BadAss FX](https://arthurmoorefx.sellfy.store) fame on a secret project, that will HOPEFULLY be out by the Summit too!

So come along - it'll be awesome.
