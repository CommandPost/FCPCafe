**Gyroflow Toolbox v1.1.4 (Build 18)** is out now!

It includes the following changes:

**üî® Improvements:**
- We've updated to the [latest](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/commit/2b3332dd2631d7ac0aa6e9d0d313db5f308bc386) Gyroflow Core Renderer. HUGE thank you to the amazing [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all his ongoing help, assistance, genius and support! There should be a minor performance improvement to playback, and slightly lower memory usage.
- Updated from FxPlug `v4.2.7` to `v4.2.9`.
- 3156 lens profiles have been added from the hero Gyroflow project. Thanks to EVERYONE who has submitted lens profiles and another HUGE thank you to [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all the work that goes into managing them.
- We now load all lens profile when the FxPlug first starts, for faster importing later.
- We now show a loading popup when a Gyroflow project is being imported or generated for Final Cut Pro, so it's obvious that something is busy behind the scenes.
- We've added a **Grant Sandbox Access** and **Reset Sandbox Access** menu items to the **Settings** button in the Inspector, so that you can grant Gyroflow Toolbox access to an entire drive, for faster importing.

**üêû Bug Fix:**
- Fixed a potential crash that we've been trying to solve for ages. On SOME systems (specifically systems with Mac2 family GPUs), Apple's Metal Framework would generate a Metal Texture that the Metal Performance Shader in the Mac couldn't actually work with, causing a crash deep within Apple's code. It was very hard to reproduce, as it only happened on certain systems - and none of ours. HUGE thank you to Apple Developer Technical Support, the Final Cut Pro Team, AdrianEddy and Warren Moore for all their constant and on-going help, assistance, guidance, patience and support!
