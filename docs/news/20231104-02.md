**CoreMelt** is at the Final Cut Creative Summit in Cupertino this week, as a Platinum Sponsor.

To celebrate they're offering **30% off** both **ShotAnvil** and **PaintX** until 10th November.

Just use the offer code: **FCPCS23XD***

If you missed what ShotAnvil can do, take a look at the [range of tutorials](https://coremelt.com/pages/shotanvil-tutorials).

If you don't need everything ShotAnvil does, [PaintX](https://coremelt.com/products/paintx-powered-by-mocha) gives you powerful tracked paint as a more affordable option, but is still very flexible and useful.

Both application are a **one time purchase**.
