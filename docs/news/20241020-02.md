**Gyroflow Toolbox v1.2.0 (21)** is out now!

It has the following changes:

**üî® Improvements:**
- We've updated to the [latest](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/commit/cfe07140c0c922a2b188810fddc4a1638a6eb052) Gyroflow Core Renderer. HUGE thank you to the amazing [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all his ongoing help, assistance, genius and support!
- 4606 lens profiles have been added from the hero Gyroflow project. Thanks to EVERYONE who has submitted lens profiles and another HUGE thank you to [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all the work that goes into managing them.

**üêû Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a bug when using macOS Sequoia where the hero Gyroflow Toolbox application would fail to set the correct folders when trying to grant sandbox permissions when first setting up Gyroflow Toolbox. For example, it would default to the user's "Documents" folders, rather than the user's "Movies" folder. Thanks for reporting Roman Gaufman!
- Re-designed how we render error messages in Final Cut Pro using Core Image and Metal. Hopefully this will fix random crashes some users are seeing on older versions of Final Cut Pro running on older Intel machines.
