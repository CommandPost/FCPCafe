**Bugs:**

Whilst so far Final Cut Pro 10.7 has been pretty stable and reliable, I've still seen it do some funky things.

For example, random red lines in the Timeline for no apparent reason:

If you see something similar, please report it in [FB13434993](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/285).

The Scrolling Timeline sometimes misbehaves at certain Zoom Levels. This is discussed in [FB13436367](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/294).

[Some users have reported](https://twitter.com/Alex4D/status/1730929760962777529) that Final Cut Pro thinks a QWERTY keyboard is attached, when instead a AZERTY keyboard is.

If you're using a AZERTY keyboard, we would suggest backing up your custom Command Sets prior to updating to Final Cut Pro 10.7, so that you can import them back in.

I've been able to make it crash using third party Audio Units, even after selecting **Settings > General > Audio Units > Validate on Next Launch**.

Also, since at least Final Cut Pro 10.6.10, **Send To Compressor** doesn't correctly render any third-party audio effects.

If you can reproduce, please report it in [FB13435050](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/287).

The Inspector button tooltips have disappeared - it now just says:

If you can reproduce, please report it in [FB13435003](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/286).

When first installing Final Cut Pro 10.7 it had the code name for ProRes Proxy in the Rendering Dropdown:

Since seeing this, ProRes Proxy is no longer an option in the Rendering Dropbox.

When trying to change a font, the font variation popup menu would sometimes loose it's text, and you couldn't select a different variation.

Interestingly, when this is happening and you hover over the empty popup menu items, the render bars above the selected Title go crazy.

This could prove to be a **major regression** - but we need to do some more testing to confirm exactly what's going on. So far some other users have been able to reproduce this, so it looks like a bug sadly.

If you can reproduce this issue, please let us know in [FB13434977](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/284).

However, generally speaking, it's been pretty rock solid - even when enabling the Scrolling Timeline on our massive Blackmagic RAW test timeline, which is full of all kinds of weird and wonderful BRAW clips in all different types of frame sizes, frame rates and aspect ratios.

We'll continue to test and explore Final Cut Pro 10.7 over the coming weeks and report any findings on FCP Cafe.

If you spot any bugs or issues, please make sure you report them on the [Bug Tracker](/bugtracker/). Thanks team!
