**WWDC 2025** has launched! ðŸ¥³

However, unlike previous years, I didn't have the interest and excitement to get up at 3am to watch the [Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_DjDdfqtUE) or [Platforms State of the Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51iONeETSng).

In fact, I haven't even finished the Keynote yet. ðŸ˜¬

However, for Final Cut Pro editors there's not a huge amount of exciting news.

**Metal 4** is coming to Mac & iPad, so that'll bring some improvements.

> The latest version of Metal is built to scale to the needs of modern apps. The streamlined API makes it easy for you to achieve optimal performance on Apple silicon with lower overhead command encoding and scalable resource management. Compilation is more explicit and faster than ever with all new ways to reduce run-time compilation.
>
> Metal 4 introduces first-class support for machine learning, starting with native support for tensors in both the API and shading language. Integrate machine learning directly into your Metal app using the command line to execute large networks, or within your shaders to inline inference operations alongside the rest of your shader code.
>
> Metal 4 also extends the MTLDevice that you already use today. You can incrementally adopt features that will help your app or game the most, in the order you need them.

**Background Tasks** are coming to iPad, so you'll finally be able to export from Final Cut Pro on iPad in the background, without Final Cut Pro aborting the export if you change app focus. ðŸ¥³

Here's some example Swift code:

```swift
import BackgroundTasks
import SwiftUI

@main
struct ColorFeed: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // ...
        }
        .backgroundTask(.appRefresh("com.colorfeed.wwdc25.appRefresh")) {
            await self.handleAppRefreshTask()
        }
    }
}
```

**Image Playground** gets an update, with support for ChatGPT - but really, who is ACTUALLY using Image Playground in Final Cut Pro today?

...and so far, that's pretty much it as far as I can tell.

I still need to finish the [Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_DjDdfqtUE) and [Platforms State of the Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51iONeETSng), so I'll post more tomorrow if anything jumps out.

There's normally lots of cool new tech, as the WWDC videos are released each day.

Fun fact... All of the 2024 Apple WWDC videos were graded using Tangent panels in Final Cut Pro controlled by CommandPost. I wonder if they did the same this year? ðŸ¤”
