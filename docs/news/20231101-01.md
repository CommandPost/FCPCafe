This week, everyone in the Final Cut Pro community has been talking about Apple's **Scary Fast** keynote.

Faster Mac's is always a great thing for Final Cut Pro users. The 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Max looks like an absolute beast!

The fact they shot everyone on an iPhone is insanely impressive. However even more exciting is finally seeing some behind-the-scenes footage from a keynote - camera aside!

You can watch the full keynote on YouTube here:
