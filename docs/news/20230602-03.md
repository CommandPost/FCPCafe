**Der Schatten** (The Shadow) is streaming tomorrow on German public broadcaster [ZDFneo](https://www.zdf.de/serien/der-schatten/trailer-staffel-1-104.html).

It's a **6 x 45min mystery** series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by **Melanie Raabe**.

_The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young & arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen._

**Commentary Head of Editing:**

> Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
