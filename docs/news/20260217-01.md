Happy Tuesday!

Unrelated... I saw [There's Still Tomorrow (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21800162/) in the cinema last night - and it was AMAZING. HIGHLY recommended.

You can watch the trailer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNREdtrrQyk).

We've got some exciting updates this week! Our latest app [ScriptStar](https://scriptstar.fcp.cafe) is now up for [pre-sale on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/scriptstar/id6759045715) and goes live on Friday! We'll share more later this week!

Also, **VFX Toolbox** and **Notion Toolbox** will be making their way to the Mac App Store VERY soon.

**LogicSplitter** will be making it's way to FxFactory VERY soon as well!

Exciting times!

Onwards & Upwards!
