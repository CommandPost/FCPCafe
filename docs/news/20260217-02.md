Apple have announced a "Special Apple Experience" (as opposed to an "event") in **New York**, **London**, and **Shanghai**, taking place on **4th March 2026 at 9:00am ET**.

This is most likely similar to the "experience" Apple gave a bunch of influencers in LA for the launch of Apple Creator Studio.

Only select members from the media in the three major cities are invited.

So far, there's been no information or leaks as to what they might be slowing, and the Apple logo doesn't really give much away.

The rumour mill predicts that several new Apple products will be released soon including:

- [2025 iPad Air with 11-inch and 13-inch display options, M3 chip, Touch ID power button, and optional 5G connectivity](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/)
- Apple TV
- HomePod Mini
- iPhone 17e
- MacBook Pro M5 Max
- MacBook Pro M5 Pro
- MacBook with A18 chip
- Studio Display

For Final Cut Pro users, new MacBook Pro's would certainly be welcome and exciting!
