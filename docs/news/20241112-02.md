**Jumper v2024.11.12** is out now!

It includes the following improvements:

**🆕 Important Changes:**
- We've removed silence checks from the speech processing pipeline (for now, since it causes issues in some cases).
- If you have very long silent audio/video files, simply don't check the speech processing in the Media panel for these clips.

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed issues with `.mxf` files having malformed timecode values.
- Error-safe parsing of `.caf` audio file metadata.
- We no longer ignore an audio file if there is some issue parsing the audio channel count.
