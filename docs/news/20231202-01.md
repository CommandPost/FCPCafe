Since its release yesterday, we've been busy testing and exploring Final Cut Pro 10.7.

So far we haven't found any issues or problems with Final Cut Pro 10.7 and [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io), [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe), [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.fcp.cafe), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.fcp.cafe), [Recall Toolbox](https://recalltoolbox.fcp.cafe) or [Fast Collections](https://fastcollections.io/).

If you haven't already, you can read all the release notes in [yesterday's post](/news/20231201).

It's worth noting that **Pro Video Formats** & **FxPlug SDK** also got an update. The **Workflow Extensions** SDK did not.

There's lots of great videos out there talking about this update, such as:

Rather than just recapping what the above people have already covered in depth, we instead wanted to discuss some more of the niche/more technical things...
