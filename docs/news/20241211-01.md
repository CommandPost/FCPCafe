**BRAW Toolbox v1.4.2 (72)** is out now!

It contains the following bug fixes:

- Fixed a bug where the Toolbox drop zone failed to work properly in Final Cut Pro 11 due to depreciated FCPXML versions. Thanks for reporting Alex Sofonea!
- Fixed a bug where the **Check All/Uncheck All** button in the Workflow Extension didn't work correctly. Thanks for reporting Mathew Welsh!
