**iZotope RX 11** is out now.

> RX 11 takes audio repair and background noise removal to the next level. With cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, new Streaming Preview and Loudness Optimize tools, a completely revamped Dialogue Isolate and Music Rebalance, and an improved Repair Assistant as well as additional ARA support, cleaning up your audio with precision has never been easier.

Unfortunately RX 11 isn't officially supported in Final Cut Pro (although the Audio Units will appear in Final Cut Pro) - however you can use their standalone RX Audio Editor application.

RX 11 does however work in Logic Pro 10.7, Pro Tools 2024, Ableton Live 11-12, Cubase 13, Nuendo 13, Studio One 6, Reaper 7, FL Studio 21, Adobe Audition 2024, Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 and DaVinci Resolve 19.
