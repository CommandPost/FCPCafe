**BRAW Toolbox v1.3.6 (64)** is out now!

This release contains the following bug fix:

- Fixed a potential crash that we've been trying to solve for ages. On SOME systems (specifically systems with [Mac2 family GPUs](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf)), Apple's Metal Framework would generate a Metal Texture that the Metal Performance Shader in the Mac couldn't actually work with, causing a crash deep within Apple's code. It was very hard to reproduce, as it only happened on certain systems - and none of ours. HUGE thank you to Apple Developer Technical Support, the Final Cut Pro Team, AdrianEddy and Warren Moore for all their constant and on-going help, assistance, guidance, patience and support!

Gyroflow Toolbox also contains this same code/problem, which we've fixed - however, we're currently waiting for one more fix in Gyroflow Core before pushing publicly - hopefully soon.
