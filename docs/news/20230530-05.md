**AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta** with 14-bit MIDI CC is [now available](https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/).

AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. Itâ€™s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.

AudioSwift works great in companion with [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) via MIDI for [controlling Final Cut Pro](https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/).
