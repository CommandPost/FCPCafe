Yesterday Apple released updates to Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro for iPad, Motion and Pro Video Formats.

These updates drop support for macOS Monterey - only macOS Ventura and Sonoma are now supported, which is disappointing, but not surprising.

Unfortunately we've already had reports from [FxFactory](https://fxfactory.com) that the Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 update has at least one serious bug.

**FxFactory** writes:

> Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 is now available on the Mac App Store. This version breaks all FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.
>
> Regrettably this constitutes the entirety of our catalog featuring object tracking or face detection, since developers and users alike have come to favor the Title layer for its flexibility.
>
> Because of the large number of products affected, we recommend that you do not apply this update.

Sadly, Apple doesn't provide beta releases to most third party developers, so it's a mad scramble to test and review updates once they're made public.

We're currently in the process of testing and reviewing all the updates, and will post more on FCP Cafe as new things come to light.
