The charming **Shamir Allibhai** from [Eddie AI](https://heyeddie.ai) has released an awesome little blog post.

He explains:

> I remember April 2011. It was when Apple launched Final Cut Pro X and ended FCP 7. FCP X’s magnetic timeline looked amazing but too much of radical departure for me back then. It was too hard to use after having learned and depended on FCP 7. I migrated to Adobe Premiere.
>
> The launch didn’t just divide the editing world — it shattered it.<br />
> Editors walked out. Forums caught fire. Careers shifted overnight.
>
> But what if we got the story wrong?
>
> What if that launch wasn’t a failure… but a fault line?<br />
> One that quietly reshaped the next decade of content creation?
>
> We wrote about this pivotal moment in our latest long form article...
>
> The Final Cut That Wasn’t — A deep dive into the launch that broke the industry before building it again. For editors, creators, and anyone who loves a good comeback story.
