Thanks to everyone who visited Max & Ronny at the OWC booth at MPTS to check out **Jumper for Final Cut Pro**!

There was lots of excitement - especially seeing that Jumper analysis files created in Final Cut Pro, can be used in Avid Media Composer, DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro and Jumper Standalone - on Mac and PC!

You can read more about Jumper on our [original FCP Cafe article](https://fcp.cafe/news/20241106/).
