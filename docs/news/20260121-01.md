At the start of last year I was invited to be a guest on [Ascent Media's podcast](https://ascentmedia.com.au/ascendyourstory).

To be honest, last year was a bit of a rollercoaster for a million different reasons, so when the podcast was publicly released last September, I completely forgot to share it publicly!

If you want to see me ranting for an hour about all things nerdy, you can watch my Ascend Your Story podcast episode on YouTube:

You can also find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/25ZzfVgQbwAO6CQpcCA2nJ?si=e3644f8772614b9e) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ascend-your-story/id1814501879?i=1000708524202)

Thanks heaps Sam for having me on the show!
