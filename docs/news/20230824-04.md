For any poor Final Cut Pro editors out there that still have to jump back to Avid Media Composer every now and again, Scott Simmons has written a great article called **Speeding Up Avid Media Composer**.

Interestingly, Scott's using [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) to control Avid Media Composer over screen-sharing.

You can read it over at [ProVideo Coalition](https://www.provideocoalition.com/speeding-up-avid-media-composer/).
