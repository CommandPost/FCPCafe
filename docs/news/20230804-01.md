**Gyroflow Toolbox v1.1.0** is out now!

I've dramatically improved the user interface to make it much easier, faster and more powerful.

You can now just drag & drop clips from the Final Cut Pro Browser to the Effects Inspector, including [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe) clips!

Learn more and [buy Gyroflow Toolbox on the Mac App Store](https://gyroflowtoolbox.fcp.cafe).
