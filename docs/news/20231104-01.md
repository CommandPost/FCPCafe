If you can't use your camera or video output device (such as a Blackmagic or AJA IO card in Final Cut Pro) after updating to **macOS Sonoma 14.1**, Apple has released a workaround.

Starting in **macOS Sonoma 14.1**, cameras and video output devices that don't use modern system extensions won't be available to use unless you restore the legacy settings.
