At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new **MediaExtension** Framework, which is **BIG NEWS** for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.

This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesnâ€™t natively support.

This means that for [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/), we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!

We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/), so stay tuned!
