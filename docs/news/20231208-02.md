Just a friendly reminder that third party FxPlug4 plugins can't crash Final Cut Pro - only Final Cut Pro can crash Final Cut Pro.

This is explained in more detail on the [Bug Tracker page](/bugtracker/).

For example, Threefold Films recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/3fld/status/1732731336694140955):

> Simon Says Transcription is crashing #fcpx and making my day harder todayâ€¦.

However, as explained on the Bug Tracker, this is a Final Cut Pro bug - nothing to do with Simon Says.

There is also a workaround, as documented [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/298).
