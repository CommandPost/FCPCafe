This is slightly old news now (apologies - it's been a crazy month), however last week Apple updated all of the ProApps! ðŸ¥³

![](/static/whats-new-fcp-11-2.png)

For developers, **FCPXML** remains on `v1.13`, **FxPlug** remains on `v4.3.3`, **Workflow Extensions** remains on `v1.0.3`.

Interestingly, Compressor now includes a **Apple ProRes RAW Processor** Media Extension plugin.

As far as I'm aware, this is the first shipping **Media Extension** on the Mac App Store.

The [MediaExtension Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaextension) provides a means for developers to create format readers, video decoders, and RAW processors for media that the system doesnâ€™t natively support.

Now that Apple has a Media Extension in the wild of their own - it's really only a matter of time until Blackmagic finally releases their Media Extension for Blackmagic RAW - as announced at last year's Final Cut Pro Creative Summit.

Until then though, [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe) still remains the best way to access BRAW directly/natively in Final Cut Pro.

These ProApp's updates were mainly focussed on macOS Tahoe and ProRes RAW on iPhone support - with a few bug fixes thrown in.

The official release notes are as follows:

**Final Cut Pro v11.2** includes the following enhancements, changes, and bug fixes:

- Unlock even more controls for ProRes RAW video shot on iPhone, so you can adjust exposure, color temperature, tint, and demosaicing. (ProRes RAW capture requires supported iPhone models.)
