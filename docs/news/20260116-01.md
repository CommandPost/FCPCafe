[Cult of Mac reports](https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-kills-free-90-day-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-trial) that Apple has removed the 90 day free trial of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro.

Because the trial timer reset with each Final Cut Pro & Logic Pro update, there's quite a few Final Cut Pro users that have actually just been using the free trial for years, as there's generally been a new update every 90 days.

Some users also realised that you just needed to delete a file to reset the trial - for those wanting to stay on an older version.

This definitely isn't a surprise, and eventually I'm sure Apple wants everyone to jump to the subscription option.
