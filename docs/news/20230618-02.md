Russ Hughes has written a great blog post titled: [**I Ignored Davinci Resolve - I Was Wrong**](https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/i-ignored-davinci-resolve-i-was-wrong).

It explains why he jumped from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve for editing, from a sound designers perspective.

For context, for the stuff [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com) does Final Cut Pro is still king, for the simple fact that itâ€™s the most fun and most creative tool to edit with.

DaVinci Resolve is INSANELY powerful, and Blackmagic is a much more friendly company to work with than Apple.

However, I personally feel like I'm an engineer when using Resolve, whereas in Final Cut Pro I feel like an artist.

You can do amazing things in both tools - but Final Cut Pro feels like the better instrument for creative flow.
