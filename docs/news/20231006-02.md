**AI-Powered Speech Restoration:**
dxRevive is a versatile speech restoration plugin, dedicated to enriching the quality of various dialogue recordings.

dxRevive features highly optimized algorithms based on artificial neural networks. The whole processing happens locally without sending data to the cloud or requiring special hardware. No uploading time delays or sharing of protected audio material required!
