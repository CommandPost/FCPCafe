You can join the live stream starting:

- Los Angeles 10 AM PDT on Thursday the 14th of September
- New York 1 PM EDT on Thursday the 14th of September
- London 6 PM BST on Thursday the 14th of September
- Singapore 1 AM SGT on Friday the 15th of September
- Tokyo 2 AM JST on Friday the 15th of September
- Sydney 3 AM AEST on Friday the 15th of September

With USB-C capture cards soon to be supported on iPad, rumours of USB-C iPhone’s, and BMD hiring so many web programmers, maybe IBC will be where BMD really takes on “Camera to Cloud” workflows? I expect more metadata from cameras in BRAW too! Exciting times…
