Pinch and a punch for the first day of the month! Woohoo!

**EasyEase** on **FxFactory** brings easing of keyframes directly into your editing workflow, allowing you to apply custom easing functions to the position, scale, and rotation of your clips and elements.

Unlike other plugins, which animate simply from point A to B without keyframes and offer limited easing options, EasyEase supports full keyframing of its parameters. This means you can create complex animations with multiple keyframes, adjusting the speed by changing the distance between them.

EasyEase provides a wide range of easing functions, including unique options like **Back Ease In & Out**, **Back Ease Out**, **Ease In**, **Ease Out**, **Quadratic Ease Out** and more.

By exposing and mimicking the Position, Scale, and Rotation parameters and applying these cool animation easing effects, it brings functionality to Final Cut Pro that hasn't been there before.
