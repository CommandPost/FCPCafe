Introducing **IF Motion**!

I'd like to introduce you to a new plugin creator for Final Cut Pro.

Itallo is a former employee of [LenoFX](https://www.lenofx.com), he's now behind [IF Motion](https://ifmotioon.net).

He is launching his paid plugins and is offering a 20% discount when you use the code: **LENOFX20**

> You can also download the freebies to try them out, they are great. Especially the Basic Transitions.
