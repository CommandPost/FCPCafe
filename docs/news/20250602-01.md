Wow - it's June already. That went quick.

**ATEM Exporter v1.0.2 (Build 4)** is out now!

This release has **zero** improvements or bug fixes - sorry!

However, it does have an INCREDIBLY cool new icon but the insanely AWESOME [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com/). ðŸ¥³

Matthew has made some KILLER icons for me over the years...

...but I think this one may be near the best!
