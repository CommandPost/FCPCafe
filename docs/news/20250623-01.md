Also, in very positive news, [Mashable reports](https://mashable.com/article/vidcon-2025-tech-products-we-loved) from **VidCon 2025**:

> **The editing software of choice? Final Cut Pro**
>
> TikTokkers can keep CapCut. At VidCon 2025, it's all about Final Cut Pro. For Apple users who shoot and edit their own content, this Mac video editing software is indispensable. So far, it's the single most-recommended product we've encountered in conversations with creators. A subscription will set you back $299.99, but there is a free trial to test it out.

That's awesome news, and to be honest, very surprising given all the help, support and sponsorship Adobe gives VidCon!
