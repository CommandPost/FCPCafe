**John Gruber** has posted a detailed blog post titled, **Vision Pro, Spatial Video, and Panoramic Photos**.

This is interesting because yesterday Apple has announced that Final Cut Pro will gain **spatial video editing** at some point **next year**.

John begins with...

> Yesterday Apple released developer beta 2 of iOS 17.2, the first version of iOS to include support for capturing spatial video with iPhone 15 Pro models. Today came the public beta, enabling the same feature. Apple invited me to New York yesterday, not merely to preview capturing spatial video using an iPhone, but to experience watching those spatial videos using a Vision Pro.
>
> The experience was, like my first Vision Pro demo back at WWDC in June, astonishing.
