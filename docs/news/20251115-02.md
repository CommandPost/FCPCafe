**Compressor v4.11.1** is out now with a security fix:

- Addresses a security vulnerability involving external connections to Compressor's open TCP/IP ports.

Given Apple very rarely release security only updates for their ProApp's, this is probably a good one to update quickly incase this is being exploited in the wild.

This addresses [CVE-2025-43515](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/125693):

> Available for: macOS Sequoia 15.6 and later
> **Impact:** An unauthenticated user on the same network as a Compressor server may be able to execute arbitrary code
> **Description:** The issue was addressed by refusing external connections by default.
> **CVE-2025-43515:** CodeColorist and Pedro Tôrres(@t0rr3sp3dr0)

You can download on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/compressor/id424390742).
