I'm also busily working away on my next app for the Mac App Store, **SplitTake**.

SplitTake is a Swift/Swift UI application for capturing your screen, webcam and external microphone to ProRes for editing in Final Cut Pro.

There's a lot of great screen recording apps out there, but a lot of them (like ScreenFlow) expect you to do all the editing WITHIN their app - I just want something that easily records the highest quality possible, then gives me everything in Final Cut Pro.

I'm still trying to get the under-the-hood stuff working well first, before tackling the user interface, but here's a sneak peak:

I'll hopefully get it up on TestFlight next week. Stay tuned!
