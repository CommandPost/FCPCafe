The **Metaburner Pro** beta period continues the excitement with new awesome new features in each TestFlight release.

Beta 14 introduced Lua scripting - allowing you to programmatically generate whatever text you want!

It's still very much a work-in-progress, with the aim to release on the Mac App Store by end of January.
