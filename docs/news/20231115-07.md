**Jamie Lejeune** noticed on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/restlesspix/status/1724512953746276805) that **Blip** allows you to upload Final Cut Pro project directly.

The FAQ explains:

> **Can Blip send Final Cut Pro projects?**
> Yes! Unlike many other services, Blip can send Final Cut Pro .fcpbundle files without needing to zip them first.
> .fcpbundle files are technically folders, and Blip fully preserves folder structures and any links within.
> And of course, Blip works regardless of the tool you use, be it Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, or something else entirely.

Blip is currently a free service that allows you to send files directly between two desktop or mobile devices. It doesn't store files on the cloud - it transfers directly between devices.
