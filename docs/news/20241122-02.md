- **Fix:** The timeline area oriented the Arrow cursor to its center point rather than its tip. This made dragging sometimes confusing and unintuitive
- Improve audio track's automation point UI
- Allow drag and drop of videos into the video player
- Show more extension status' in the window title bar
