_Pinch and a punch for the first day of the month!_

There's a great new article to read over at [The Film Stage](https://thefilmstage.com) titled **Jia Zhangke’s Editor Matthieu Laclau on Shaping Decades of Footage and His Trio of Cannes 2024 Premieres**.

You can read it [here](https://thefilmstage.com/jia-zhangkes-editor-matthieu-laclau-on-shaping-decades-of-footage-and-his-trio-of-cannes-2024-premieres/).

Not mentioned in the article is that Matthieu uses Final Cut Pro. He writes:

> Our studio is called CUTTING EDGE FILMS and we collaborate on most of our films. Technically, we setup a very sophisticated collaboration workflow using Hedge Postlab and Apple Final Cut Pro. I know that most feature film editor are cutting with Avid or Premiere, and I used both of them in the past, but we’re not going back... Thanks to FCP, we are really more efficient, faster and even better editors, because we spend more time on the creative part instead of the technical aspect of the job.

Congratulations Matthieu on all your success at Cannes 2024!
