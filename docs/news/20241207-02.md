**Jumper 2024.12.05 (1453)** for Apple Silicon Mac's is out now!

It includes the following updates:

**üÜï Important Changes**
- We now finally support **visual processing** of `R3D` files! To enable this feature, you need to go to [www.red.com/downloads](https://www.red.com/downloads) and download and install **REDCINE-X PRO**.
- We now save the transcriptions as plain text files in the audio analysis folder. The transcription can be found in the two `.txt` files if you right-click on a file in Jumper's media table and click **Reveal Audio analysis**.

**üî® Improvements**
- Improve frame capture quality when making reverse image searches via Final Cut Pro

**üêû Bug Fixes**
- Prevent automatic shutdown of Jumper Engine if the Final Cut Pro Trial version is running.
- Make sure the settings for target audio and video track in Premiere Pro doesn't reset on restart, thanks for reporting @citizensam!
- Make sure we are frame-accurate when doing reverse image searches from a Premiere Pro timeline, thanks for reporting @citizensam!
