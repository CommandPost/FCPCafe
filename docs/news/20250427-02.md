**Jumper is coming to Avid Media Composer & DaVinci Resolve!**

Whilst this isn't _technically_ Final Cut Pro news, it will bring some benefits, as Jumper's analysis files will be common between Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve (Mac & Windows), Adobe Premiere Pro (Mac & Windows) and Avid Media Composer (Mac & Windows)!

A standalone/desktop version of Jumper is also in active development.

You can learn more on the [Jumper website](https://getjumper.io/?ref=fcpcafe).
