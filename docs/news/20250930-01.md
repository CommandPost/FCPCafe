It adds support of X-OCN footage in a MXF container - so that you can use X-OCN footage shot with the popular Sony VENICE 2 and Sony BURANO cameras as well as with Sony PMW-F55, F5 and other models that record X-OCN video internally or onto an external unit.

Support for legacy Sony RAW format like from F65 camera will be added in a future version.

This Media Extension allows you to access X-OCN footage with Final Cut Pro 11.1 (or later), Finder, QuickTime Player, and any other macOS application that supports Media Extensions.
