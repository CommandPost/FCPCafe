**Audio Design Desk v2.0.1** is out now with the following bug fixes:

- Login error is now handled where you have no name entered into your account. This was blocking the sign in previously. If that was the case for you, please enter your name in the account portal too. Most ADD 1.0 users were missing their name in the account migration to 2.0.
- Can now check for updates from the login window
- Adding stems with element markers to triggers from the right click menu can now offer to split into elements. This previously only worked by dragging in files into the triggers table.
- Trigger clips made from stems with multiple elements could have incorrect sync point when triggered
- Stems in triggers will now use their first sync marker as a trigger sync point rather than the start of the file
