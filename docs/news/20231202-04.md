**Library Database:**

The Final Cut Pro Library Database version has also been updated to `1090`, compared to `1071` in Final Cut Pro 10.6.10.

This means that any Libraries created prior to Final Cut Pro 10.7 will need to be updated to the latest format, and you can't go back from 10.7 to earlier versions of Final Cut Pro.

Whilst Final Cut Pro does always do an automatic backup of libraries prior to updating them, we also **strongly recommend** manually creating a ZIP file of your library before updating too, so that you can roll back to an older version of Final Cut Pro if a major bug or regression is found.

The [Backups for Final Cut Pro](/ecosystem/tools/#backups-for-final-cut-pro) application is also highly regarded for automating library backups.

Interestingly, Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3 also uses the `1090` database format - so Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad are once again in version parity.

~~Unfortunately for us, Final Cut Pro for iPad has become less interesting after Apple prevented **Transfer Toolbox** from working - which was our solution to get from Mac to iPad.~~

~~We've since stopped developing Transfer Toolbox for now - you can read more about this decision in more detail [here](https://transfertoolbox.fcp.cafe).~~

**UPDATE (3rd Dec 2023):** After writing this news entry, we've since brought back Transfer Toolbox to life with Final Cut Pro 10.7 support. You can learn more [here](https://transfertoolbox.fcp.cafe).

Our big hope/dream with Final Cut Pro for iPad was to use it for doing director/client/agency selects, and then send those selects to the Mac, but ideally we want to do all the prep work on Mac - i.e. syncing everything with Sync-N-Link, etc.

You can easily get from Final Cut Pro on iPad to Mac, so we're now exploring ways to take the selects from iPad and translate them across to Multicam Clips created in Sync-N-Link (for example).

The fact that you can now import **iMovie for iOS** projects into Final Cut Pro for iPad might be a hint that native Mac to iPad is also on their radar/wish-list.

Apple still publicly advertise that Third-party Content is coming soon to Final Cut Pro for iPad - so we should see third party MotionVFX Motion Templates on iPad at some point in 2024:
