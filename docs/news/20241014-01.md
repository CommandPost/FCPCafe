The [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee) team (aka Marques Brownlee's YouTube team) gives a full masterclass on how they make high quality video.

Why is this relevant? They cut in Final Cut Pro - woohoo!

It's a really awesome video - and [Mariah Zenk](https://www.instagram.com/totallynotabusinessacc/) gives some amazing insight into how and why she cuts things together. She's awesome.

What I find most interesting is the lack of emoji's in the Library!

All the event names and underscores just make me feel like a technician - not an artist.

I'm personally a BIG fan of using emoji's - it makes Final Cut Pro more colourful and fun:

You can watch the editing section on YouTube here:

Thanks for sharing [JonnyLewisFilms](https://x.com/JonnyLewisFilms/status/1845516567565508613)!

I've just linked straight to the editing section above, but it's totally worth watching the whole thing - especially the audio section, which is super fun and interesting.

Although I am very surprised they're using Sennheiser MKH 416 Shotgun Microphones for their interior shoots, as opposed to a hyper-cardioid microphone, like a Schoeps CMC641, Sennheiser MKH 8050 or a Audio Technica AT4053B ([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYWD5wI6B9k) is worth a watch for anyone interesting in learning more!).

I'm also surprised how far away they're positioned the microphone - generally you want the microphone to be as close as possible to the talent, ideally no more than a foot away.

Here's some screenshots from the video:

I LOVE that the MKBHD is so open and happy to share all this amazing insight! Great work team!
