**BRAW Toolbox v2.0.0 (80)** is out now!

This is a MAJOR update with MASSIVE performance improvements!

It contains the following changes:

**🔨 Improvements:**
- This is a MASSIVE update. We've made HUGE changes under the hood to improve performance on Apple Silicon Mac's. BRAW Toolbox should now be faster and more stable than ever before. HUGE thank you to the amazing Anton Marini for all his help, guidance, genius and support! However, due to the sheer number of under-the-hood changes, we highly recommend making a ZIP of your current version of BRAW Toolbox before updating for safety, so that you can rollback if needed.
- Added a "Open User Guide" button to the BRAW Toolbox application.
- Updated from FxPlug v4.3.3 to v4.3.4. Thanks Darrin Cardani and everyone at Apple!

**🐞 Bug Fix:**
- Fixed a regression in **BRAW Toolbox v1.5.0** which could cause non-Immersive BRAW clips to crash BRAW Toolbox. My sincerest apologies for missing this bug during testing! HUGE thank you to Aaron Hokanson, Chris Johnson, Joseph Teegardin, Sallen307, SamVChicago, Samir Varma and Vinnys-Cinevita for reporting and helping me troubleshoot!

Now that this is out the door, we're busily working on new Immersive features!

The plan is to have a completely end-to-end workflow in Final Cut Pro & BRAW Toolbox, so that you can edit in Final Cut Pro and export to Vision Pro in Compressor. Stay tuned!
