**Reveal in Browser:**

It's worth noting that the enhanced **Reveal in Browser** feature allows you to locate a clip in the Browser without losing your selected Keyword Collection or Smart Collection.

However, if no Keyword or Smart Collection is currently selected, it will still just match back to the Event.

For a number of years now, CommandPost has had a **Reveal in Keyword Collection** action:

![](/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection.png)

If you trigger **Reveal in Keyword Collection** on a clip in the timeline that has multiple keywords applied to it, it will prompt you for which one you want to reveal to:

![](/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection-selection.jpg)

This feature still works great on Final Cut Pro 10.7, and can be handy when you want to quickly match back to a Keyword Collection, rather than an Event.
