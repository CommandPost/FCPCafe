Chris at [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com/technology/) has updated the pricing for [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe), [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.fcp.cafe) & [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.fcp.cafe).

- **[BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe)** is now **79.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD79.99**, **USD79.99**, **CAD79.99**).
- **[Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.fcp.cafe)** is now **19.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD19.99**, **USD19.99**, **CAD19.99**).
- **[Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.fcp.cafe)** is now **4.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD4.99**, **USD4.99**, **CAD4.99**).

Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:

- **[Recall Toolbox](https://recalltoolbox.fcp.cafe)** is now **29.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD29.99**, **USD29.99**, **CAD29.99**).
- **[Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.fcp.cafe)** is now **4.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD4.99**, **USD4.99**, **CAD4.99**).

However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.

Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.

Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.
