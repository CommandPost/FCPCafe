**CSV2Notion Neo v1.3.0** is out now with the following improvements:

- Automatically analyse and generate captions for images using Hugging Face's open-source AI/ML models
- Added `--hugging-face-token`: Hugging Face token to use image captioning model online
- Added `--hf-model`: Provide the model used for generating caption `<vit-gpt2 | blip-image | git-large>` (defaults: `vit-gpt2`)
- Added `--caption-column`: Provide both image column and column where caption would be written

CSV2Notion is an advance method to upload & merge `*.csv` or `*.json` files with images to Notion database.

It's used under-the-hood to power the **Shot Data** Toolbox in [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io/toolbox/shot-data/), and [MarkersExtractor](https://github.com/TheAcharya/MarkersExtractor).
