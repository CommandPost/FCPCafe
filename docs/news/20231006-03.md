**Final Cut Pro 10.6.10** is out now, which includes the following fixes:

- Fixes an issue that could cause an FxPlug-based title that analyzed a clip to result in an incomplete analysis.
- Fixes an issue that could cause a Motion template with an applied Align To behavior to display an incorrect animation.

This fixes FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.

HUGE thank you to Apple to listening to companies like FxFactory and turning around a bug fix so quickly!

**Final Cut Pro for iPad 1.2.1** is also out now, which includes the following fix:

- Fixes an issue that caused some titles and transitions to have incorrect animations.
