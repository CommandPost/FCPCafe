> Our hope in making this film was to honor Troy and his father, but also to present the piece in a way that was accessible to a hearing and deaf audience at the same time.

> Troy’s story is told in American Sign Language (ASL) with open captions on for the duration of the movie.

> This was a truly challenging piece to edit and we had to consult with a lot of deaf experts to make sure we were accomplishing our accessibility goals. I think we did what we set out to do and I’m very proud of the finished work.

> I hope to do a longer case study in the future now that I can reflect on the project in its completion. I appreciate all the help and support I received from the FCP community in the editing process and will pass along what I’ve learned. Please watch if you get a chance. Thank you!
