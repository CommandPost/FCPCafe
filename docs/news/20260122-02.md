**LumaFusion v5.4.1** is out now with some FCPXML fixes:

**Improvements:**
- The last selected category for each effect editor is maintained while the Clip Editor is open.

**Bug Fixes:**
- Background Export was hanging for some users. We've now made Background Export an option in Advanced Settings so customers can turn it on and off.
- Error exporting FCPXML to Finder on macOS.
- External display for HDR projects was incorrect.
- Crash when using many large images in a timeline.
- Audio Duck End Duration could not be set properly
