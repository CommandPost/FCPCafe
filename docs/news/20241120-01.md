In very sad news, the post production community recently found out via Rohanâ€™s brother in-law that Motion guru **Rohan Marks** has unexpectedly past away.

Whilst I knew of Rohan and his amazing work in the Motion and Final Cut Pro community, I didn't know him personally, however **Bret Williams** of [BretFX](https://www.bretfx.com) has shared these thoughts:

> ðŸ˜¢ It is with great sadness that I share with the group that our resident Motion guru Rohan Marks passed away last week. According to his sister he was "lost suddenly and too soon." Rohan was an amazing soul and a mentor to us all here. Rohan was one of the nicest guys I've ever known.  We had become good friends over the last few years, chatting frequently about Motion and life in general.<br />
> Spreading the word about Motion, and helping people learn Motion was one of his passions. He even recently went so far as to say to me that "Motion literally changed my life. For the best." He was proud of the work he did as one of Stupid Raisins creatives and more recently you could find his own solutions on FxFactory as "ROWIE" and his tutorials on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rowie409).<br />
> Please keep Rohan's family and friends in your thoughts and prayers. Rest in peace Rohan. You will be sorely missed. ðŸ’”

From all reports, he was a very loving, helpful, and talented person - and will be very much missed by everyone in the Motion and Final Cut Pro community.
