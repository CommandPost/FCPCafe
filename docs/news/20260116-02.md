**Dylan Bates (The Final Cut Bro)** recently posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzvw-9DudGY) about [Patrokiras's](https://www.instagram.com/patrokiras/) [Final Cut Pro X Workspace Remapper](https://www.fcpxbooster.com/workspace-remapper/).

This is a free tool that allows you to completely customise your Final Cut Pro Workspace layout.

In theory it's amazing - and Patrokiras has done a great job building a fantastic website to customise things. It's a really nice user interface!

Because a `fcpworkspace` file is just a plist (Property List) - it's actually very easy to mess around with an customise - you can just open it in a text editor (I use [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)).

Back when I first started working on FCPX Hacks, which later became CommandPost, I had a tool that allowed you to customise Final Cut Pro workspaces in a very similar fashion.

[Alex Gollner (Alex4D)](https://alex4d.com) was also messing around with these files about a decade ago.

However, what we discovered is that hacked or customised workspaces made Final Cut Pro pretty buggy and unstable, and we were generating lots of crash reports.

When I spoke to Apple about this, they basically said to stop messing with the Workspace layouts - so we did.

So now that Patrokiras has released a very friendly and easy-to-use way of creating your own layouts, it'll be super interesting to see if the same users start to report more FCP bugs and crashes.

I've already started to see a few reports of people saying that things like the Export button randomly stop working.

If you're using a customised workspace, and Final Cut Pro isn't crashing and is rock solid - please let us know in the comments!
