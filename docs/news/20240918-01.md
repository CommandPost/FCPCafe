If you're a developer who works with Final Cut Pro **Workflow Extensions**, you may have noticed that things break when you upgrade to **macOS Sequoia 15.0** and **Xcode 16.0**. Doh!

Thankfully the fix is fairly simple once you know the trick...

If you're seeing this:

![](/static/workflow-extension-error-1.jpg)

Simply change this:

![](/static/workflow-extension-error-2.png)

To this:

![](/static/workflow-extension-error-3.png)

This is because in Xcode 16.0, a clang fix was made that now requires a space after the entry linker option `-e` to disambiguate this option from other options that start with the letter `e`.

To fix the error, you simply need to separate out the `-e` from `_ProExtensionMain` in the **Other Linker Flags** build setting.

As of today, the [Workflow Extensions SDK](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional-video-applications/workflow-extensions?language=objc) hasn't been updated, but hopefully we'll see this fixed in the Xcode template soon.

Thanks to Phil in the [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org/au/Melbourne/index.html) community for helping me work this out!
