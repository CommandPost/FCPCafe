But I didn't want to end the day on a downer, so...

People often ask me **"what makes Jumper so special"** and **"why would I use Jumper when Premiere has Media Intelligence now built-in"**?

Well, if you're a Final Cut Pro editor, you should **ABSOLUTELY** be using Jumper - it's a no-brainer.

But even for **Avid Media Composer**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and **Adobe Premiere Pro** users, Jumper is **insanely useful** - especially in high-end collaborative workflows.

You can even access **Jumper Standalone** from your Mac menubar. Remote users will be possible in the not-so-distant-future too! ðŸ¤¯

It's basically **"Spotlight for your NLE"** - and it's SUCH a handy tool to have in your toolbox.

It hasn't changed the way I edit - I still organise Events with lots of emoji's, in the Final Cut Pro Browser, and I still do selects in the Browser's collections - for example:

However, I basically use Jumper as my "search engine" for times when a client asks "find me the shot of the old man with the red hat", etc.

When I'm doing fast-turnaround edits, unless I have two machines, I don't really have the computer power to analyse things whilst I'm editing (as Jumper makes use of every bit of CPU, GPU and RAM you throw at it!), so I generally just let Jumper analyse everything overnight once I've finished for the day, so when it comes to revisions, I can find things super quickly.

You can download a **free trial** and learn more about Jumper on the [Jumper website](https://getjumper.io/?ref=fcpcafe).

You can read about **my involvement with Jumper** on this FCP Cafe news post from [6th November 2024](https://fcp.cafe/news/20241106/).

To demonstrate it's power - I've just recorded a very quick and dirty screen recording.

This video is unscripted, real-time, no edits, warts and all, using beta software... so... well... enjoy!
