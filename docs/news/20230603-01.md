It's been so incredibly exciting watching all the professional editors contributing to this site via GitHub (check out these [closed pull requests](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)!).

I proposed creating [avid.cafe](https://avid.cafe) and [premiere.cafe](https://premiere.cafe)/[premierepro.cafe](https://premierepro.cafe) on some big Facebook Communities and my posts were [pretty quickly removed](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1664442143262543872).

Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my [crazy spur-of-the-moment idea](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569), and gone full steam ahead - love it!

Thanks team!
