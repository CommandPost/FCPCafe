**Pipeline Neo v2.3.1** has been released!

For those unfamiliar, Pipeline Neo is an experimental FCPXML library built with the assistance of LLM tools.

It currently supports reading, creating, and modifying FCPXML documents and bundles, with parsing and validation against bundled DTDs spanning versions `v1.5` through `v1.14`.

Typed models cover resources, clips, adjustments, filters, transitions, multi-cam, captions, smart collections and many more.

Pipeline Neo provides a strong foundation and the essential building blocks for expanding FCPXML parsing and reading capabilities and adding features.
