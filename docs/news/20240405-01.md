Arctic Whiteness' **Final Cut Library Manager** now has a new home at **Hedge**!

![](/static/arctic-banner.jpeg)

After a decade of hard work and lots of updates (amazingly, they were up to version `v3.98`!) Vincent Zorzi & Timothy Arms have decided to step away from their epic creation, and hand over development to Hedge to keep the application alive for the Final Cut Pro community.

Hedge have renamed the application to **Arctic**, and it has an awesome new icon.

You can read more about this in great detail on the [Hedge blog](https://blog.hedge.video/a-new-home-for-final-cut-library-manager/).

If you already own Final Cut Library Manager, the application will continue to work indefinitely, but it will no longer be updated or supported.

Final Cut Library Manager customers will have already received a discounted upgrade for Arctic in their email inbox. Please [contact Hedge](https://docs.hedge.video/arctic/upgrades) if you didn't get it.

Arctic and Final Cut Library Manager are completely separate applications - each with their own unique licensing and updating systems - which means you can still run them side-by-side, or run Final Cut Pro Library Manager on your old machine, and Arctic on your new machine, etc.

You can learn more, and download a free 10-day trial on the [Hedge website](https://hedge.video/arctic).
