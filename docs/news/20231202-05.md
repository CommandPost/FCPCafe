**Command Sets:**

The only two Command Editor items between Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and 10.7.0 are **Collapse to Connected Storyline** and **Timeline Scrolling**.

They did however follow the more recent macOS naming conventions, and renamed the **Preferences** item to **Settings**.

They also replaced a lot of **OS X** to **macOS** in various warnings and error messages.

The built-in default Command Set also has had a few changes:

- **Collapse to Connected Storyline** has been added as **COMMAND+SHIFT+DOWN**.
- **Set Monitoring Angle** has changed from **SHIFT+V** to **SHIFT+OPTION+M**.
- **Start/Stop Voiceover Recording** has changed from **SHIFT+OPTION+A** to **SHIFT+OPTION+R** (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).
- **Record Voiceover** has changed from **COMMAND+OPTION+8** to **SHIFT+V** (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).
