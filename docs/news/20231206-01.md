We've brought back Philip Hodgetts & Dr Gregory Clarke's amazing blog post, **Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs** originally written back in 2017 for fcp.co (which has sadly since been retired).

You can read it [here](/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/).

We will also be bringing back some of Ronny Courtens's amazing case studies over the coming weeks! Stay tuned.
