**Color Finale Transcoder 2** now supports **Canon RAW video** (`CRM` files). ðŸ¥³

> This popular format joins BRAW and N-RAW as formats you can edit directly on the Final Cut Pro timeline with full control over exposure, white balance, and color temperature.
>
> Still using Transcoder 1? Donâ€™t worry â€” an exclusive discounted upgrade to Version 2 is available for all Transcoder 1 users, now with powerful new Canon RAW support.

We've tested `CRM` files in Final Cut Pro and it works well:

However, the Canon RAW implementation still has the same bugs/issues as we've [previously reported](https://fcp.cafe/news/20240613/) with Color Finale Transcoder for BRAW and N-RAW - i.e. it doesn't work well with speed effects.
