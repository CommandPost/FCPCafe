**Captionator for Final Cut v2.1.4** is out now with the following bug fixes:

- Bugfix: Re-adds the Build In/Build Out option for Custom Titles (now found
under the custom title panel)
- Bugfix from 2.1.3: Model panel would sometimes show "Loading...", and should now be fixed.

You can download on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/captionator-for-final-cut/id1627843786).
