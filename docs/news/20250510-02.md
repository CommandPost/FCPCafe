**Caption Pop AI v1.1.5** is out now!

It now includes background text boxes, improved color pickers, new languages, and a DTD bug fix.

The auto-updateâ€™s broken, so to install:

- Quit FCP & SR app
- Delete the SR app
- Download and install new version
- Restart FCP and then relaunch Caption Pop AI

After updating, both the SR app and Caption Pop AI should have 1.1.5 version numbers.
