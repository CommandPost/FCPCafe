# Articles

This section of the site is dedicated to linking to great external articles, as well as providing a space to write FCP Cafe specific articles.

[fcp.co](https://fcp.co) is an entire site dedicated to Final Cut Pro, so there's lots of articles there.

There's also a massive collection of Final Cut Pro articles over at [macProVideo.com](https://macprovideo.com/articles/final-cut).

Richard Taylor also links to a lot of great articles on [FCPX.TV](https://fcpx.tv).

In the coming weeks we'll update this page with direct links to relevant and useful articles.
