            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

<p>We're still working on the formatting - they're currently a bit &quot;buggy&quot; in terms of automatically resizing, and sometimes require a hard page reset to appear properly. We're investigating a proper fix - stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta</strong> with 14-bit MIDI CC is <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/">now available</a>.</p>
<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commentary Head of Editing:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been so incredibly exciting watching all the professional editors contributing to this site via GitHub (check out these <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">closed pull requests</a>!).</p>
<p>I proposed creating <a href="https://avid.cafe">avid.cafe</a> and <a href="https://premiere.cafe">premiere.cafe</a>/<a href="https://premierepro.cafe">premierepro.cafe</a> on some big Facebook Communities and my posts were <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1664442143262543872">pretty quickly removed</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569">crazy spur-of-the-moment idea</a>, and gone full steam ahead - love it!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new <strong>MediaExtension</strong> Framework, which is <strong>BIG NEWS</strong> for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.</p>
<p>This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support.</p>
<p>This means that for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!</p>
<p>We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox</strong> v1.1.4 (51) is <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">now available</a> on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.</p>
<p>Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.</p>
<p>As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> the default option as a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a <strong>Custom</strong> Solids Generator.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.</p>
<p>We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.</p>
<p>To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a <strong>Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)</strong> Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.</p>
<p>HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.</p>
<p>We'll leave <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Russ Hughes has written a great blog post titled: <strong>I Ignored Davinci Resolve - I Was Wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>It explains why he jumped from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve for editing, from a sound designers perspective.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/i-ignored-davinci-resolve-i-was-wrong">here</a>.</p>
<p>For context, for the stuff <a href="https://latenitefilms.com">LateNite</a> does Final Cut Pro is still king, for the simple fact that it’s the most fun and most creative tool to edit with.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve is INSANELY powerful, and Blackmagic is a much more friendly company to work with than Apple.</p>
<p>However, I personally feel like I'm an engineer when using Resolve, whereas in Final Cut Pro I feel like an artist.</p>
<p>You can do amazing things in both tools - but Final Cut Pro feels like the better instrument for creative flow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just to keep you on your toes...</p>
<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.2.2 (54)</strong> is out now, with some internal improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a bunch of additional checks to the FxPlug4 Renderer, to ensure that all objects received from the Blackmagic RAW SDK are valid and correct to avoid any potential crashes due to referencing null pointers. Thanks for reporting Dominik Radecki! Big thanks to the Blackmagic RAW team and Final Cut Pro team for all their help and support!</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've thrown together a simple Python script called <strong>Rename Avid MXF Files</strong>.</p>
<p>It's used to rename MXF files generated by Avid Media Composer to match the <strong>Package Name</strong> in their metadata.</p>
<p>The script can process a <strong>single file</strong> or a folder containing <strong>multiple</strong> MXF files.</p>
<p>This is useful if you want to move native Avid MXF files from Avid Media Composer to Final Cut Pro.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses an issue where audio effects would not be reset during playback.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an Audio Units effect could have incorrect values when importing using FCPXML.</li>
<li>Improves waveform redrawing on expanded audio components when adjusting volume with the Touch Bar.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where the Voice Isolation Amount slider would snap to 0% when trying to set a value less than 7%.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with the Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Control Range setting in the Color Adjustments effect would be incorrectly set to SDR when importing using FCPXML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this update requires a database update, so there must be some bigger changes under the hood.</p>
<p><img src="/static/database-update.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad 1.1</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn snapping on or off using the keyboard shortcut N.</li>
<li>Move the playhead backward or forward 10 frames using the keyboard shortcuts Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow.</li>
<li>Show info for browser clips using the keyboard shortcut Control-I.</li>
<li>Turn skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut S.</li>
<li>Turn audio skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut Shift-S.</li>
<li>Split and switch multicam clip angles using the keyboard shortcuts 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>Show or hide the jog wheel using the keyboard shortcut Control-Shift-W; expand or collapse it using Control-W.</li>
<li>Switch the jog wheel between playhead mode and nudge mode using the keyboard shortcut Shift-W.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with custom fonts not appearing in the inspector.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when dragging a clip from the browser to the timeline.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue with keyboard shortcuts not working as expected in the content browser.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback when adding effects and transitions to timeline clips in Position mode.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where importing media on a device with no remaining storage would cause Final Cut Pro for iPad to quit unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where importing clips with the same name would generate blank clip thumbnails.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when using soundtracks and dynamic titles.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where copying and pasting transform settings would unexpectedly paste clip speed.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback and reliability when rating and adding keywords to clips while filtering clips in the browser.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where resetting audio settings would unexpectedly reset clip speed.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with the appearance of onscreen controls for cropping and shape masks.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where clip height adjustments would not update audio-only clips in connected storylines.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Keywords window would open offscreen with the timeline minimized.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where disabled multicam audio angles would appear in the audio component list in the inspector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 on Mac uses a newer Library format than Final Cut Pro 1.1 on iPad. This means that if you want to use Transfer Toolbox to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using Final Cut Pro 10.6.6.</p>
<p><strong>Compressor 4.6.5</strong> is out now with the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Settings and Locations sidebar to now be resizable when the Inspector is open.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when processing 4:2:2-based H.264 media on Mac computers with Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where the color space of a Photo-JPEG source was incorrect when Color space was set to Automatic.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an exported IMF supplemental package was one frame shorter than the original package.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motion 5.6.5</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves stability with FxPlug 4 plug-ins.</li>
<li>Improves stability when dragging a group that contains an FxPlug plug-in to the Favorites folder.</li>
<li>Improves performance when using the Sequence Text behavior with Anchor Point set to Line (in the Layout pane of the Text Inspector).</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited to test it out, and see if there's other undocumented fixes and improvements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[20th July 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been cutting all day with <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a fresh job (i.e. not something migrated from 10.6.6), and it has a LOT of third-party Motion Templates, effects, random still images, random videos in a variety of formats, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst I was able to successfully edit, and export without too many dramas, 10.6.7 definitely seems more buggy and unreliable than 10.6.6.</p>
<p>I had to manually quit and restart Final Cut Pro quite a few times throughout the day because the Viewer was just black. Nothing I could do would bring it back to life, apart from a restart.</p>
<p>This is consistent with other professional long-form editors I've chatted to.</p>
<p>After one of the restarts, after applying an cut to an audio clip, and adding a transition, suddenly the Viewer went &quot;strobing&quot; - again, requiring another manual restart.</p>
<p>I haven't had any crashes, but it's definitely got... issues.</p>
<p>One major <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/217">confirmed bug</a> is that Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 doesn't properly respect 0% opacity in Motion Templates. For example, if you apply the <code>Placeholder</code> Generator, it will ALWAYS show the notes:</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpx-10-6-7-bug.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This could be a deal breaker if you're using a Motion Template that uses this technique to hide things. Luckily none of the Motion Templates I used today had any issues.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)</strong> uses a newer Library format than <strong>Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to use <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a> to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)</strong>.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to stick with Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 for now, and wait for another bug fix in a few weeks time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>From the team behind Audio Design Design, <strong>SoundGen</strong> is a generative AI experience that turns your text prompts into music and art, with the option to download the files and add them into your film and audio projects.</p>
<p>The beta program is entirely free for you to use and experiment with. As SoundGen matures, the developers will be integrating it directly into <strong>Audio Design Desk</strong>.</p>
<p>Their goal is to give their users access to an even broader collection of sounds on demand, right within the DAW.</p>
<p>The alpha version can only do a maximum of 30 seconds. Depending on the prompt, sometimes it can found great, other times it's very computer generated. It'll definitely improve dramatically over time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.8</strong> is now available on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p>The release notes only have one line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixes an issue where video could freeze in the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, based on early reports, this release seems to fix the various crashes that users were reporting too, in addition to the Viewer sometimes going black or strobing.</p>
<p>If you're currently using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier</strong> we recommend sticking with that for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if you're using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> we recommend updating.</p>
<p>Please make sure you make a backup of your Final Cut Pro application by creating a <code>ZIP</code> file of it, before updating. You should also manually backup any libraries before updating.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've just released a very niche new app to the Mac App Store called <strong>Fast Collections</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>thousands of keywords</strong> across many events, it can take a long time to create a new Smart Collection with your preferred keywords directly within Final Cut Pro - but with <strong>Fast Collections</strong>, it can now take seconds.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Luke Nash</strong> is an up-and-coming Final Cut Pro &amp; Motion Developer who's currently working on some awesome new tools to help with building complex user interfaces in <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/motion/">Apple Motion</a> easier, faster and more powerful.</p>
<p>His latest project, <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, is an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/fxplug?language=objc">FxPlug4</a> plugin that works in Apple Motion to provide a powerful rectangular on-screen control that can be used and combined with other Apple Motion effects. For example, if you wanted to build a colour correction tool with powerful masking features, you could use <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> to allow your users to draw masks via an on-screen tool in the Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro Viewer.</p>
<p>Whilst <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> has been written in Objective-C using the FxPlug4 API (Apple Motion's Effects API for third party developers) - it's easily accessible within Apple's Motion, just like regular built-in tools, so anyone who's making Motion Templates in Apple Motion can make use of this functionality without knowing any code. Essentially these are tools to make it easier for people to make awesome Motion Templates, which can then be &quot;exposed&quot; in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Luke is currently demonstrating <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> via a series of YouTube videos, with the intention of trying to raise funds to cover a new Mac and Apple Developer Account via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">this Indiegogo campaign</a>. If he can raise the necessary funds to finish <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, he will release the software for free, and potentially even open-source.</p>
<p>There are very few FxPlug4 developers in the world, especially in terms of solo indie developers - so it's awesome to see Luke really tackling uncharted territory. These tools could potentially be game-changers to the growing list of Final Cut Pro YouTuber's that are also building their own Motion Templates to sell.</p>
<p><strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> is still very much a work-in-progress, with a beta build hopefully coming in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> and his other <strong>Luke’s Got Groups</strong> project <a href="https://lukesgotbrains.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the Indiegogo project <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7th September 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our good friend <strong>Bradley Andrew</strong>, founder of <a href="https://filmdrives.com">FilmDrives</a> and creator of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/crew-call/id1532198878">Crew Call</a>, has just released a really exciting new iPad App onto TestFlight.</p>
<p><img src="/static/video-assist-logo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Whilst this isn't strictly Final Cut Pro related - I'm sure it'll be of interest to many of the Final Cut Pro Community - especially those shooting, as well as editing. There's a whole world of possibilities here, for both production and post.</p>
<p><strong>Video Assist</strong> allows you to use your iPad as an external monitor and recording device with compatible USB Capture Cards.</p>
<p>You can easily record videos or capture frame grabs from any HDMI Video Source. SDI Video Sources are also supported with specific capture cards.</p>
<p>Video Tools such as Color Correction, Transform, Grid Lines, Center Marks and Aspect Ratio Masks are built-in.</p>
<p><strong>Record Trigger</strong> is supported for all ARRI Alexa and Sony Venice Cameras via a custom computer vision model.</p>
<p>Support for RED and Blackmagic Cameras will be coming prior to public launch.</p>
<p>Only yesterday Bradley built <strong>RGB &amp; Luminance Histograms</strong> into the app and has enabled a clean video output from the iPad. This means you can use your iPad as a recorder and then output a clean video feed of live or playback via a USB-C to HDMI Adaptor or via AirPlay.</p>
<p>To date, the only way to use your iPad as a monitor is via a <a href="https://qtakehd.com/hardware/screenport/">QTake ScreenPort</a> or the <a href="https://accsoon.com/accsoon-seemo/">Accsoon SeeMo</a> range.</p>
<p>This app-based approach is super exciting, as it allows people to use off-the-shelf hardware to turn under-utilised USB-C iPads into great displays.</p>
<p>USB Capture Cards range from $20-$250 depending on compatible resolutions, so they are well within reach for most people.</p>
<p>You can watch a short demo of the app in action on YouTube:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KxTDOyLeWQ"><img src="/static/video-assist-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Bradley is super lovely and insanely talented, and <strong>Video Assist</strong> is such a great implementation - you can tell he's had decades of experience in the camera department, as the user interface is so familiar and easy to use.</p>
<p>We've been chatting with Bradley about all the possibilities for hooking up his app to Frame.io and Final Cut Pro for more seamless exchanges of favourites/selects and on-set notes. Exciting times!</p>
<p>If you are curious and want to test it for yourself on a <strong>USB-C iPad running iPadOS 17 Beta</strong>, you can try the pre-release version via Apple TestFlight <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/vgjAL68x">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s iPhone Media Event is scheduled for 12th September, and typically new iOS versions go live the day after the event or at the end of that week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Apple released updates to Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro for iPad, Motion and Pro Video Formats.</p>
<p>These updates drop support for macOS Monterey - only macOS Ventura and Sonoma are now supported, which is disappointing, but not surprising.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we've already had reports from <a href="https://fxfactory.com">FxFactory</a> that the Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 update has at least one serious bug.</p>
<p><strong>FxFactory</strong> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 is now available on the Mac App Store. This version breaks all FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.</p>
<p>Regrettably this constitutes the entirety of our catalog featuring object tracking or face detection, since developers and users alike have come to favor the Title layer for its flexibility.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of products affected, we recommend that you do not apply this update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read more about this bug <a href="https://fxfactory.com/news/finalcutpro-10.6.9-skip-the-update/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, Apple doesn't provide beta releases to most third party developers, so it's a mad scramble to test and review updates once they're made public.</p>
<p>We're currently in the process of testing and reviewing all the updates, and will post more on FCP Cafe as new things come to light.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For developers, Apple has also updated the FxPlug 4 SDK.</p>
<p>At this stage, there's been no update to the Workflow Extensions SDK (currently at v1.0.2, released in January).</p>
<p>The <strong>FxPlug 4.2.8 SDK</strong> includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of unsupported FxPlug 3 properties from the FxPlug framework</li>
<li>Support for GPU and backwards analysis in the <code>FxBrightnessAnalysis</code> example</li>
<li>Plug-ins built with newer SDKs now handle canceling of analysis without crashing in older hosts.</li>
<li>The template and example properties have been updated to conform to the removal of some FxPlug 3 properties. This includes the <code>kFxPropertyKey_UsesRationalTime</code> and <code>kFxPropertyKey_IsThreadSafe</code> properties.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when an FxPlug 4 plug-in with custom UI displayed in the inspector crashed, or was terminated by the OS. It will now redraw its custom controls immediately rather than waiting until the next communication with the plug-in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with a potential crash when using the <code>FxColorGamutAPI</code>.</li>
<li>Analysis no longer returns frames with a 1-pixel border around them.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections-1-1-0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>This was originally intended to be a very niche application, primarily used by long-form documentary editors.</p>
<p>However, as requested by Vigneswaran Rajkumar, we've added the ability to <strong>Generate</strong> a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc.</p>
<p>This is very handy for long-form projects, so to make the application more accessible, we're also reduced the price to a one-time payment of <strong>USD$9.99</strong> on the <strong>Mac App Store</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Picture This</strong> allows you to harnesses the power of Generative AI to create unlimited, copyright free images from a Final Cut Pro Project right on your Mac, using the latest version of Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-01.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-02.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-03.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>To quote the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create stunning AI text-to-image artwork from Markers in your Final Cut Pro Projects or Premiere Pro Sequences. Picture This… takes the text-to-image prompts from Markers in a Project or Sequence and generates image variations for each prompt, and returns these images to Final Cut Pro as a new Project with Auditions, or to higher tracks in a Premiere Pro Sequence, for easy comparison.</p>
<p>Using the latest version of Stable Diffusion, Picture This… provides background batch processing of images and the convenience of Auditions in your Final Cut Pro Projects.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong>
Create your prompts where you will use them: in red Markers in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Processes as a Batch in the Background</strong>
Batch processing allows to you use your time productively while Picture This… — your “art department” — does it’s AI magic.
Important: Do not continue working on that timeline. Any work you do on your edit will not be included in the results returned from Picture This…</p>
<p><strong>Aligned in your Edit</strong>
New images display right where you need them in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong>
Use multiple passes to hone in on the image you need. Optionally, fine tune the prompt each time.
Images are always free, whether you generate one or 1000.
Processing happens on your local Mac, never in the cloud.</p>
<p>Images cannot be copyright individually, but do not limit the copyright on the finished project.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong>
In Final Cut Pro enter your image description (text-to-image prompt) in a To-Do Marker where you want the image to start. Or in Premiere Pro, add a red Sequence Marker with a prompt. Images continue to the next Marker or to the end of the underlying clip.
Export and Import XML, or drag a Project (FCP only) to Picture This….
Choose your settings and click Start to generate images.
After processing the Project is returned to Final Cut Pro with Auditions, and each Audition contains the alternative images for each prompt. Or the Sequence is ready to import to Premiere Pro, with the generated images stacked on Video Tracks above your existing edit. There will be on track for each alternate image generated from the prompts.
You can modify prompts and send the Project/Sequence to Picture This… again.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>
An Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Sonoma
At least 8GB of RAM, but 16GB or more is recommended
English text-to-image prompts are currently supported
It requires macOS Sonoma and an Apple Silicon Mac.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We were very sad to learn today that <strong>fcp.co</strong> has officially disappeared from the Internet.</p>
<p>The site now permanently redirects to Peter's <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com">idustrialrevolution</a> website.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpclose.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>We've been a big fans of everything Peter has done with fcp.co over the years, especially the incredible case studies.</p>
<p>I've personally been very fortunate to have articles about CommandPost, BRAW Toolbox, Gyroflow Toolbox and the Neighbours spin-off series, Erinsborough High featured on the site. HUGE thank you to Ronnie, Alex &amp; Iain for writing articles about our stuff!</p>
<p>Running a website like fcp.co is a HUGE amount of work, especially when you're running a very active forum, so massive hats off to Peter for keeping it going for over a decade!</p>
<p>Peter explains <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com/blogs/news/whatever-happened-to-fcp-co">on his site</a>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FCP.CO?</strong></p>
<p>Good, question, hopefully this short blog will answer a few queries about the life and eventual closure of the best Final Cut Pro website.</p>
<p>The site ran for over 12 years, it started before Final Cut Pro X was released and surfed the wave of creation, innovation and finally in the latter years, frustration.</p>
<p>First of all, it is very hard to run a news site about a product when there isn't any news!  Although there are some very active individuals in the FCP ecosystem who make a lot of noise, there isn't much happening these days.</p>
<p>That might be because there are hundreds of thousands of happy FCP editors out there that just get on and edit. It might be because everyone has bought every FCP product they need. Or have the majority of editors shifted over to Premiere and Resolve?</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the old problem of the cost and effort of running a site compared to the return. Although we had a few great advertisers who worked with us for a long time, there were a lot of companies who wanted a lot for nothing. That doesn't pay the bills. We were in fact quite shocked by the rudeness of a few individuals when asked for help after promoting their products/services for free for a number of years.</p>
<p>Over the last 18 months our hosting became a problem. What started off as a brilliant home for the site, lost all of its peripheral services and scheduled maintenance that made the site tick over. So it was either move the site to a new host that had better customer care, or close.</p>
<p>So, why is the explanation of the closure on this website? Because, for the majority of its life, Idustrial Revolution's sales have underwritten the cost. We were in discussion with a few parties about taking over the site, but they all eventually fizzled out.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to close the site, I still believe FCP is the fastest and most creative NLE out there, but the industry doesn't share the same opinion. At one point Apple had a massive share of the NLE market with FCP7. FCPX never really recovered from the disastrous launch and Premiere (as bad as it was/still is) filled the vacuum.</p>
<p>Finally, chapeu to a few of the people that made the site the success it was. Thank you to David R, Sam, Ronnie, Roger, Philip &amp; Gregg, Iain, Oliver and of course Karsten who without his daily help, the Forum would have died under a mountain of spam.</p>
<p>All is not lost though, I will add content to the blog section on this site. So please come back, you might even like one of our plugins!</p>
<p>Peter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can checkout Peter's awesome plugins and blog posts over at <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com">idustrialrevolution</a>.</p>
<p>We hope he continues to release new and exciting Final Cut Pro plugins, and interesting blog posts!</p>
<p>We're also hopeful <strong>FCP Cafe</strong> can help fill the void fcp.co has left for Final Cut Pro professionals - especially in terms of Case Studies.</p>
<p>The aim for FCP Cafe has always been for it to be open and community driven. You can learn more on our <a href="/contribute/">Contribute page</a>.</p>
<p>It's all hosted and managed from GitHub, so people can always fork the site (like <a href="https://sequence.film/docs/">Sequence already has</a>!) - so hopefully it will never disappear from the Internet.</p>
<p>Thanks again Peter for EVERYTHING you've done for the Final Cut Pro Community! Onwards &amp; Upwards!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Blackmagic Design writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced new lower prices for the Blackmagic Cloud Store family of high performance network storage. The Blackmagic Cloud Store Mini 8TB is now reduced by $710 to $1,645, Blackmagic Cloud Store 20TB is reduced by $1,950 to $5,645 and Blackmagic Cloud Store 80TB is reduced by $7,400 to $15,595. These new prices will help make high performance network storage affordable for anyone!</p>
<p>Blackmagic Cloud Store and Blackmagic Cloud Store Mini are extremely fast high capacity network disks designed to handle the large media files used on Hollywood feature films. The design uses an advanced flash memory core so it easily handles lots of simultaneous users accessing media files at the same time. There is also an HDMI monitoring output so you can watch a live graphic view of the storage operating on a TV or monitor. Plus, with built in Dropbox and Google Drive sync, files can be distributed between multiple Blackmagic Cloud Stores globally so each site has very fast local file access, even though files can be distributed on lower cost internet connections.</p>
<p>Blackmagic Cloud Store models are in stock and available from Blackmagic Design resellers worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really interesting for Final Cut Pro users, as Blackmagic's network storage is now one of the most cost effective options around.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6th November 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today was day one of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p>The day opened with an incredible talk with Nick Harauz interviewing the amazing <strong>Justine Ezarik</strong> (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey_c7U86mJGz1VJWH5CYPA">iJustine</a>).</p>
<p>Nick was the perfect interviewer, helping create an engaging, entertaining, insightful and honest conversation that was a joy to listen to.</p>
<p>Justine is so incredibly talented and insanely hard working. The talk provided a unique insight into how a person with <strong>7.1 million</strong> YouTube subscribers runs her business, stays healthy, deal with trolls and haters, collaborates with other like-minded YouTubers, and how her and her editor use Final Cut Pro, <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#postlab">PostLab</a> and [Frame.io] to create great content quickly and consistently.</p>
<p>She's the real deal - open, honest, no bullshit, hard working, genuine.</p>
<p>Next up <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">Chris Lawley</a></strong> talked about how he's gotten rid of his Mac all together, and moved completely to iPad and Final Cut Pro for iPad, in another very insightful, engaging and entertaining talk.</p>
<p>Then after a rather tasty boxed lunch, we all jumped on three buses and headed to <strong>Apple Park</strong>.</p>
<p>Sadly, there was no photos or videos allowed to be captured whilst in Apple Park.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaApNeppjvg">watch this 2018 video on YouTube</a> which shows some amazing drone footage of Apple Park during construction.</p>
<p>We all had special passes stored in our iPhone Wallets to gain access to the park, getting one of two coloured Apple lanyards (which we could keep) on entry:</p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-invite.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-id.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We then walked around the insanely impressive Apple Park building, with friendly Apple staff evenly spaced along the fairly long walk making sure everyone was going the right way, with no phones out.</p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-sign.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We then all entered an awesome little conference room inside the Apple Park circle, with one of the best LED screens and sound systems I've ever seen in that kind of smaller scale conference room.</p>
<p>Apple gave an insanely slick and polished presentation showing off the upcoming Final Cut Pro 10.7 release. Seriously - perfect sound, perfect presentations - it was like watching a keynote talk.</p>
<p>There was no NDA, and we were strongly encouraged to share things online (but again, no photos at Apple Park).</p>
<p>You can find all the specific details about the announcements here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can read the official Apple News Room Article titled <strong>Final Cut Pro takes video editing on Mac and iPad to the next level with powerful new features</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/final-cut-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-get-powerful-updates/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can read <strong>Iain Anderson's</strong> ProVideo Coalition article on <strong>More details: Final Cut Pro 10.7 at the FCP Creative Summit</strong> <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/more-details-final-cut-pro-10-7-at-the-fcp-creative-summit/">here</a>. Iain is at the conference.</p>
<p>You can listen to <strong>Richard Taylor</strong> talk about the release on his YouTube Live Stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrO7PxoKD4g">here</a>. Richard is at the conference.</p>
<p>You can read <strong>Scott Simmons's</strong> ProVideo Coalition article on <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.7 announced, shipping later this month</strong> <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/final-cut-pro-10-7-announced-shipping-later-this-month/">here</a>. Scott is not at the conference.</p>
<p>You can watch <strong>Matthew O'Brien</strong> talk about <strong>HUGE Final Cut Pro 10.7 Update Just Announced!</strong> on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56GklXX2YDE">here</a>. Matthew is not at the conference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was nothing discussed in person that hasn't been publicly announced in the Apple News Room, however, one thing that was mentioned in passing in the demo room is that the Scene Removal Mask machine learning model has been dramatically improved on iPad and Mac, which is super interesting.</p>
<p>One interesting point to note is that even though the <strong>Scary Fast</strong> event wasn't cut in Final Cut Pro (yes, it was cut in Premiere) - everything for <strong>Apple Fitness+</strong> is - over <strong>4,700 videos</strong>, 15 hours every week, all cut in Final Cut Pro using ProRes. Apple is eating their own dog food, at a major scale. Also, all the WWDC talks this year were cut in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>After the Apple presentation we were then broken up into two groups. Whilst one group got a guided tour of further along the exterior of Apple Park, the other group went inside a demo room, where friendly Apple Staff showcased the latest Mac and iPad hardware, running the pre-release Final Cut Pro, and latest Logic Pro updates.</p>
<p>Apple Park is incredible - it's such a beautiful complex. Everything is perfect, everything is clean, everything smells good, everything inside is the perfect temperature, everything tastes good.</p>
<p>In the demo room we were able to play, hands-on with the new hardware. Yes, obviously I tried duplicating lots of audio clips to see how the scrolling timeline performed with a giant complex timeline, and I did get a spinning wheel of doom - but with the fairly complex demo timelines they had, it worked great.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vincentlaforet.com">Vincent Laforet</a> was there to answer any questions about the new iPhone's - which is pretty special in of itself.</p>
<p>In terms of the Final Cut Pro announcements, it was basically exactly what I was expecting. After Apple finally gave us Dupe Detection, it was also fairly predictable that this would be the year that they'd finally give us a scrolling timeline - and it does look great.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm really happy with these incremental updates to Final Cut Pro, and they'll make my life as an editor better.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be super interesting to see what PostLab has to demo!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7th November 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today was day two of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with some super exciting news first...</p>
<p>Another unexpected thing that came out of yesterday's demonstration room at Apple Park is there's another undocumented feature in Final Cut Pro 10.7 that wasn't talked about in the official Apple Presentation...</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.7 has enhanced the <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> feature, so now if you’re in a Keyword Collection in the Browser, it will stay in that Collection if you reveal a clip from the timeline that’s in that Collection - meaning it no longer goes back to the &quot;base&quot; event, which is a HUGE workflow improvement!</p>
<p>For example, lets imagine you have an Event with a whole heap of graphics, music and sound effects in it, sorted by Keyword Collections. If you have the sound effect Keyword Collection selected in the Browser, and you <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> on a sound effect on the timeline, it will find that clip in the Browser, without changing the currently selected Keyword Collection.</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and earlier, pressing <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> would always go back to the &quot;root&quot; Event, so this is a big change, and hopefully removes the need of CommandPost's <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> action!</p>
<p>This is one of those little things that seems like such a small minor improvement, but is a MAJOR time saver. The whole reason CommandPost exists in the first place is that it was originally designed to make finding the playhead easier for Scott Simmons after match framing clips!</p>
<p>Apple is listening. Apple do care.</p>
<p>Another very exciting piece of news that came away from the show floor is that comedy feature film, <strong>For When You Get Lost</strong> has won the <strong>Audience Award for Best Comedy Feature</strong> at the <strong>Austin Film Festival</strong>!</p>
<p>This was cut in Final Cut Pro by <strong>Jeffrey Asher</strong>. Written by Jennifer Sorenson. Directed by Michelle Steffes.</p>
<p><img src="/static/for-when-you-get-lost.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>HUGE Congratulations Jeffrey and the team! We will be releasing a case study about this film in the future.</p>
<p>Back to the Summit...</p>
<p>The day opened with the <strong>Shaping the Future: Panel Discussion</strong>, hosted by Nick Harauz, and featuring Jenn Jager, Steve Martin, Andy To and myself (Chris Hocking).</p>
<p>Whilst I'm normally always &quot;behind the camera&quot; rather than in-front - I definitely had a lot of fun, and really enjoyed both Nick's fantastic questions/moderating, but also all the intelligent and thoughtful answers from Jenn, Steve &amp; Andy, who are all so insanely talented, hardworking and super smart.</p>
<p><img src="/static/future-panelists.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Afterwards there was sessions with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp Speed Editing Techniques in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Mark Spencer</li>
<li><strong>Let's Grade Together</strong> with Jeff Greenberg</li>
<li><strong>Sound Advice; How to Use Roles to Master Your Mix (Mac)</strong> with Steve Martin</li>
<li><strong>Mastering Transitions in FCP and Motion</strong> with Jenn Jager</li>
</ul>
<p>I only personally attended Mark's first session - which was awesome, as you'd expect.</p>
<p>We then broke for lunch, with some yummy lunch boxes - generally speaking, eating outside on large tables.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-lunch.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After lunch there was some more sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compress to Impress</strong> with Jeff Greenberg</li>
<li><strong>iPhone Workflows in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Abba Shapiro</li>
<li><strong>Creating Stunning Graphics in Final Cut Pro and Motion</strong> with Robin Kurz</li>
<li><strong>PostLab - The Event of the Year</strong> with Paul Matthijs Lombert, Jasper Siegers, and Isaac Terronez</li>
<li><strong>Why Multicams are One of Final Cut Pro’s Most Powerful Features</strong> with Dylan Bates</li>
<li><strong>360° Footage in Flat Timelines</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
</ul>
<p>I only personally attended the PostLab session and Dylan's session - which was really great. Dylan is so enthusiastic, so lovely, so talented, but also there was some really fantastic audience engagement and discussion, and tips were definitely shared both ways, which is awesome! It was a really fun, educational and collaborative talk.</p>
<p>But PostLab. Wow.</p>
<p>For those that don't know about <a href="https://hedge.video/postlab/benefits">PostLab</a> already, it provides incredible cloud based and on-premise collaboration for Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer &amp; Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>It's powerful, and used by a huge amount of professional Final Cut Pro editors around the world. It's subscription, or you can buy PostLab Local for your own on-premises server solution.</p>
<p>Here's what the currently shipping public version looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/static/old-postlab.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However today, Hedge threw all that away, and has essentially announced they've started from scratch on a completely new version of PostLab, that uses the same perpetual licensing as their other Hedge products (like <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#offshoot-formally-hedge">OffShoot</a> and <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#editready">EditReady</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because this new version is early days, soon to be released in &quot;Early Access Preview&quot; (i.e. beta), they've asked not to share any screenshots of the user interface shown, as things may change during development - so no screenshots here.</p>
<p>They've completely changed things architecturally - rather then requiring any cloud infrastructure, it now runs on your local machine, which means it's fast, and there's no ongoing cost.</p>
<p>There will be a standard version, and a pro version - similar to how OffShoot now works.</p>
<p>PostLab will now also support ANY and every application - not just Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere and Avid Media Composer. You can manage Pages and Numbers documents, Logic Pro projects, etc.</p>
<p>But the thing that blew my mind is <strong>Event Locking for Final Cut Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>Essentially how it works is that you create a <strong>Team Bundle</strong> anywhere you like, which contains all your data. It's similar to a Final Cut Pro Library in that it's a package (i.e you can right-click and select <strong>Open Package Contents</strong> in Finder).</p>
<p>The standard version will support a single Team Bundle, and the Pro version will offer unlimited Team Bundles.</p>
<p>You can then create <strong>Collections</strong> within the PostLab interface however you want, like Final Cut Pro and iTunes/Music. These Collections can contain any <strong>Documents</strong> (i.e. files).</p>
<p>However, where the magic lies is that if you create a Final Cut Pro library, PostLab now manages the individual events within that library.</p>
<p>For example, you could create a Collection for &quot;Episode 1&quot; and &quot;Episode 2&quot;, which each contains it's own Final Cut Pro Library. However, shared between BOTH of those libraries, you could have a single Event for &quot;Sound Effects&quot; that is common between both libraries, in both collections.</p>
<p>PostLab manages all these individual Final Cut Pro Events, so that only one person can claim ownership of them (i.e. check them out) at a time. So, for example, the &quot;Episode 1&quot; editor could be the owner/have checked-out the &quot;Sound Effects&quot; Event, which means that any other editors that try to open this Event will still be able to open it, however, PostLab will automagically inject a 🔒 emoji in the filename, so you can visually see in Final Cut Pro that the Event is essentially read-only, and no changes to that locked Event will be saved.</p>
<p>This is... magic. I have no idea how it works, because unlike in Avid Media Composer, for example, you can't just copy and paste Events between Library bundles, like you can with Avid Bins.</p>
<p>However, the geniuses at Hedge have somehow managed to make Final Cut Pro Events, behave exactly the same as Avid Bin's. It's magic, and amazing.</p>
<p>Everyone at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit has the opportunity to request access to the &quot;Early Access Preview&quot; that will go live at some point later this month.</p>
<p>The new version of PostLab will not only be massive for collaboration, but solo editors - because the new version of PostLab brings simple git-like versioning to ANY document type. This is big!</p>
<p>It also has an absolutely fantastic new icon!</p>
<p>Next up we had <strong>The Ultimate FCP Tip Session</strong> with Jeff Greenberg hosting and Dylan Bates, Abba Shapiro, Steve Martin and Mark Spencer. There was lots of handy tips and tricks!</p>
<p>Then the last session of the day was <strong>Making Media Inclusive For All: Accessible Creative Storytelling</strong> with Storm Smith, and Jenica Teregeyo.</p>
<p><img src="/static/storm-session-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was an incredibly powerful, educational, informative and inspiring session talking about empowering <strong>every viewer</strong> through accessible media.</p>
<p>It was a very slick presentation, with some great videos showcased.</p>
<p>Here's the top five things to take away from the talk:</p>
<p><img src="/static/storm-session-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then after this session it was <strong>Networking Expo Night</strong>, where you could talk to the Hedge Team, CoreMelt Team &amp; others.</p>
<p>There was several prizes given away on the night, and free food and drinks.</p>
<p>The legends that are Philip &amp; Greg also gave away a free copy of <a href="/ecosystem/workflowextensions/#picture-this">Picture This...</a> to <strong>every</strong> Final Cut Pro Creative Summit attendee, which is amazing!</p>
<p>The Summit is all about connecting with like-minded people, and sharing knowledge, and the Expo Night was the perfect demonstration of just an insanely talented bunch of people all just hanging out together sharing tips and tricks.</p>
<p>You can watch a recording of <strong>Richard Taylor's</strong> YouTube Live Stream of the Expo Night <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU3vX1QbaYc">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>...and that's a wrap!</em></p>
<p>Today was day three, and the final day of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/hallway.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the first time I (Chris Hocking) have personally attended the Summit, and it's a looooooooong and expensive trip from Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, this conference has been absolutely awesome and worth every penny.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-dj.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>HUGE thank you and congratulations to both <a href="https://www.fmctraining.com">Future Media Concepts</a> and Apple for putting on such an incredible event.</p>
<p>Ben, Megan, Jessica, Elise and the rest of the FMC team, you've all done an insanely awesome job. Thank you for making us all feel so welcome, and part of your FMC family. Putting on a huge event like this is a MASSIVE job, but you nailed it. Thank you.</p>
<p>MASSIVE thank you to <a href="https://nickharauz.com">Nick Harauz</a> (Director of Product Marketing at <a href="https://borisfx.com">Boris FX</a>) for all the incredible work he did putting everything together, but also his insanely awesome leadership/MC'ing on all the panels throughout the Summit. He's a REALLY great interviewer.</p>
<p>Bill, and the rest of the Apple team, I can't imagine how much politics and incredible hard work it was to get us into Apple Park, so thank you, thank you, thank you. It was a one in a lifetime opportunity to visit the campus, and something I'll never forget.</p>
<p><a href="https://coremelt.com">CoreMelt</a>, <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com">MotionVFX</a> &amp; <a href="https://hedge.video">Hedge</a> - thank you for supporting this incredible community financially, and allowing the conference to happen at all. Please support these three awesome companies!</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/richardtaylortv">Richard Taylor</a> for allowing people at home that couldn't attend the Summit in person to still feel connected to the event via his live streams.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-dylan.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've had... concerns, about whether or not flying across the world to hang out with a bunch of Final Cut Pro editors would be a... bad investment/waste of time or not. By the time you add flights, accommodation, conference cost, food, social drinks, etc - it becomes a very expensive endeavour, and a long time away from my young family. However this conference has been unquestionably worthwhile.</p>
<p>I've had the incredible opportunity to meet people I've only previously known via the Internet. I've got to meet and make new friends from all over the world. I've been able to connect with people who use this site and my software to do absolutely incredible things. I've been able to casually chat with the team behind the tool I use every day, Final Cut Pro, as well as all the 3rd party developers that make the Final Cut Pro ecosystem so unstoppable.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-sequence.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, I've never been to previous FMC events, however what impressed me was both the turnout, and the quality and passion of the attendees. I had the honour and privilege of meeting talented people, from all walks of life, and all different parts of the industry, that use Final Cut Pro at a very high level. Everyone's a hardcore Final Cut Pro end-user.</p>
<p>It was pretty incredible how many people travelled from Australia, the UK, Germany, etc. to come to the Summit - it truely was a global audience.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-justine.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>So... what happened today? In terms of sessions, they were some of the best of the week.</p>
<p>First up we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Person Masking, Tracking and Paint in ShotAnvil, a session presented by CoreMelt</strong> with Ché Baker</li>
<li><strong>Shooting and Editing Captivating Interviews in FCP</strong> with Abba Shapiro</li>
<li><strong>Word Play: Advanced Typography Techniques in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Jenn Jager</li>
<li><strong>Hooking in Hardware</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Workflows</strong> with Nick Harauz</li>
<li><strong>Hide and Seek: Advanced Masking and Tracking in FCP</strong> with Robin Kurz</li>
</ul>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CoreMelt session first up. Ché Baker &amp; Roger Bolton did an excellent demonstration of the new <a href="https://coremelt.com/products/shotanvil-tracked-paint-masks-and-graphics-insert-with-one-click-ai-person-keying">CoreMelt ShotAnvil</a> tool.</p>
<p>You can get <strong>30% off</strong> ShotAnvil and PaintX by visiting their special Final Cut Pro Creative Summit page <a href="https://coremelt.com/blogs/news/special-deals-for-final-cut-creative-summit-23">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/coremelt-presentation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next I attended <a href="https://iain-anderson.com">Iain Anderson</a>'s <strong>Hooking in Hardware</strong> session - which showcased how he uses <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> + MIDI Controllers + Tangent Ripple + Monogram Console to control Final Cut Pro in fast and powerful ways.</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-presentation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can watch one of Iain's older YouTube videos on MIDI controllers here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4YvDeOtpGc"><img src="/static/midi-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After another delicious boxed lunch pack in the sun, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaos to Clarity: Mastering Clip Organization (iPad)</strong> with Dylan Bates</li>
<li><strong>Controlling the Color Pipeline: HDR Workflows in Mac and iPad</strong> with Steve Martin</li>
<li><strong>Media Management Techniques</strong> with Mark Spencer</li>
<li><strong>Becoming an Accidental YouTuber</strong> with Lee Herbet</li>
<li><strong>Custom 3D Objects in Motion</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
<li><strong>Session Presented by MotionVFX</strong> with George Edmondson</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Martin's (from <a href="https://www.rippletraining.com">Ripple Training</a>) course on HDR was incredible. It was by far the most polished and slick talk of the whole conference - I really felt like I was in a University classroom for the 45mins. Steve is such a great educator and communicator - he really takes it to another level (<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/mike-seymour.html">Mike Seymour</a>-level as I like to call it).</p>
<p>Lee's talk was also great - very interesting and engaging. You can follow his YouTube adventures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@notacarguy_au">here</a>.</p>
<p>MotionVFX's session was also insanely awesome. What I didn't realise was this wasn't a MotionVFX session - as in, there were no MotionVFX staff attending. MotionVFX basically just paid for one of their external contractors, <a href="https://www.yourseedmedia.com">Seed Media</a> to do a talk about MotionVFX's new subscription tools, <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/subscriptions/cinestudio">CineStudio</a>.</p>
<p>George Edmondson and his team are one of MotionVFX's external collaborators, and produce and edit a lot of their online tutorials and promotional content - and what they do is really next level.</p>
<p>For example, George and his team made this entirely in Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsYYupd-nU"><img src="/static/cine-studio-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>George is such a great communicator and storyteller - but also the work Seed do for MotionVFX is world class.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-motionvfx.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can learn more about Seed Media <a href="https://www.yourseedmedia.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about CineStudio <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/subscriptions/cinestudio">here</a>. You can currently get 30% off all MotionVFX plugins <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/black-deals">here</a>.</p>
<p>At 4pm, we had <strong>Storytelling in Final Cut Pro</strong> panel with Josh Meyers, Mike Yanovich, and Robin Moran - with <a href="https://nickharauz.com">Nick Harauz</a> moderating.</p>
<p>These kinds of panels are what makes the Summit so powerful and so useful - true industry professionals, doing world-class high-end work, talking about their craft. Josh, Mike &amp; Robin are all three of the nicest, smartest and honest people you'll ever meet - and it's such an honour to hear about how they make their amazing art.</p>
<p>We hope to have detailed case studies with all three panelists on FCP Cafe in the not-so-distant future, as their projects become publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Then finally, to wrap up the conference, we had a Q&amp;A with the Final Cut Pro team - what a perfect way to wrap up the event!</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-apple-questions.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This event wasn't under NDA - however they asked for no photos, videos or recordings.</p>
<p>Microphones were handed around, and anyone could ask anything.</p>
<p>There were six people from Apple on the stage from marketing, engineering, quality control, user interface design and product manager for Final Cut Pro for iPad.</p>
<p>Obviously, with Apple being a giant complex company - the team couldn't talk about anything unannounced or future product plans.</p>
<p>The Apple team said that Final Cut Pro and ProApps are &quot;alive and well&quot; and the team is &quot;super excited about the future&quot;.</p>
<p>They said &quot;don't worry about the Aperture thing... it's not a thing&quot; - referring to the fact that Final Cut Pro won't go the way of Aperture, and be suddenly discontinued.</p>
<p>They mentioned they're really interested in seeing how people are using Final Cut Pro on iPad. They encourage people to <a href="/wishlist/">send feedback to them</a>, explaining in story form how you use their devices in the real world.</p>
<p>The audience all learnt a new term - S.P.O.D'ing - spinning pizza of death (i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel">spinning wheel of death</a>). They explained that if you do ever run into the spinning wheel of doom, sending detailed feedback of exactly how you got into this state is very, very helpful.</p>
<p>You can send Apple feedback in any language - they have teams dedicated to translating the feedback.</p>
<p>Apple has a plan for Final Cut Pro and the rest of the ProApps for the next few months, AND the next 5-6 years.</p>
<p>The Final Cut Pro team constantly have meetings with the wider Apple teams - for example, they're constantly meeting with Machine Learning teams to see what technologies and techniques they can bring back to the ProApps.</p>
<p>I personally asked if we'll ever see WWDC sessions on Final Cut Pro Developer technologies like FxPlug and Workflow Extensions - and they acknowledged that this is something they'd LOVE to see.</p>
<p>Overall the Q&amp;A session was calm, civil, fun, personal and entertaining. There was no NDA secrets shared. The audience got to really connect with senior members of the Final Cut Pro team on a very human level.</p>
<p>It's always nice to remind yourself that the people behind our favourite tools are just human after all.</p>
<p>And just like that, three days of the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit was over - but the discussions kept flowing in the Aloft hotel bar for many hours more.</p>
<p>Again, a HUGE thank you to everyone at FMC and Apple for making this event happen. Thank you to EVERYONE who presented, and EVERYONE who attended.</p>
<p>It was such a privilege and an honour to attend - and it was so humbling to connect with people that use CommandPost, BRAW Toolbox, Gyroflow Toolbox, Fast Collections and even the TestFlight version of Recall Toolbox!</p>
<p>You can watch <strong>Richard Taylor</strong>'s live stream directly after the Q&amp;A session on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtJ3BgPVQyA">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can refer back to the <strong>FCPCreativeSummit</strong> hashtag on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FCPCreativeSummit?f=live">here</a>. There's some fun photos in the feed!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today Apple has announced that Final Cut Pro will gain <strong>spatial video editing</strong> at some point <strong>next year</strong>.</p>
<p>CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-spatial-video-arrives-in-beta-and-looks-amazing-on-vision-pro/">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro, Apple's video editing software, will get Spatial Video editing support, but not until sometime next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/10/spatial-video-vision-pro-review/">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple released iOS 17.2 developer beta 2 on Thursday, enabling iPhone 15 Pro hardware to capture spatial videos for the first time. The public beta version just dropped as well, and so have some early press reviews of personal spatial videos on Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The company has also shared that Final Cut Pro will gain the ability to edit spatial videos sometime next year. iOS 17.2 beta 2 and macOS 14.2 beta 2 also introduce the “Spatial” media type in Photos for easy filtering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As announced at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit, Final Cut Pro 10.7 will come out later this month, so it's most likely that <strong>spatial video editing</strong> won't appear until Final Cut Pro 10.8 - maybe another 12 months away.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>John Gruber</strong> has posted a detailed blog post titled, <strong>Vision Pro, Spatial Video, and Panoramic Photos</strong>.</p>
<p>This is interesting because yesterday Apple has announced that Final Cut Pro will gain <strong>spatial video editing</strong> at some point <strong>next year</strong>.</p>
<p>John begins with...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday Apple released developer beta 2 of iOS 17.2, the first version of iOS to include support for capturing spatial video with iPhone 15 Pro models. Today came the public beta, enabling the same feature. Apple invited me to New York yesterday, not merely to preview capturing spatial video using an iPhone, but to experience watching those spatial videos using a Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The experience was, like my first Vision Pro demo back at WWDC in June, astonishing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.3.4 (62)</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>This release includes the following bug fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the previous BRAW Toolbox v1.3.3 (59) release, we made some major under-the-hood changes to improve playback performance (such as only using one shared instance of the BRAW SDK Factory). Unfortunately however, those changes resulted in the BRAW SDK not releasing used threads correctly, and as the thread count grew, eventually the BRAW Toolbox Renderer would stop working correctly in Final Cut Pro. This would only really happen on older machines, and Libraries with hundreds of BRAW clips. We've now reverted back to how we were doing things in v1.3.2 (57) and earlier, with some additional checks and protections. We will continue to research and explore ways we can improve playback performance, so that the export times of timelines with BRAW clips in Final Cut Pro get closer to what you see in DaVinci Resolve.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FAQ explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can Blip send Final Cut Pro projects?</strong>
Yes! Unlike many other services, Blip can send Final Cut Pro .fcpbundle files without needing to zip them first.
.fcpbundle files are technically folders, and Blip fully preserves folder structures and any links within.
And of course, Blip works regardless of the tool you use, be it Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, or something else entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blip is currently a free service that allows you to send files directly between two desktop or mobile devices. It doesn't store files on the cloud - it transfers directly between devices.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Recall Toolbox</strong> is out now on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p><img src="/static/recall-toolbox-banner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that acts as a Shared Pasteboard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store.</strong></em></p>
<p>You can even drag-and-drop clips and projects from the Final Cut Pro Browser, and link to files (such as logos on a shared drive).</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox automagically syncs to all your Mac's on the same iCloud account.</p>
<p>You can also share Folders with other iCloud users, and control permissions. For example, you could have a &quot;read only&quot; folder that contains client lower thirds for a current job.</p>
<p>Whilst there are third party tools like the amazing <a href="https://apprywhere.com/ce-mac.html">Copy 'Em ​(for Mac)</a>, they're not quite as visual as Recall Toolbox, and they're not built from the ground up for Final Cut Pro users.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox works as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, so it's window position gets saved with your custom Workspaces.</p>
<p>Whilst <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> has had a Shared Pasteboard &amp; Pasteboard Buffers for years, it's really optimised for Control Surfaces. You can access the Shared Pasteboard from the CommandPost menubar, and it is super powerful, but it's not as visual - you just get text, not a fully customisable thumbnail.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox feels like a natural extension to Final Cut Pro, with a similar look and feel to Final Cut Pro's Effects Browser.</p>
<p>It's <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. AUD29.99, USD29.99, CAD29.99).</p>
<p>You can find out more <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Since its release yesterday, we've been busy testing and exploring Final Cut Pro 10.7.</p>
<p>So far we haven't found any issues or problems with Final Cut Pro 10.7 and <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a>, <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a> or <a href="https://fastcollections.io/">Fast Collections</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you can read all the release notes in <a href="/news/20231201">yesterday's post</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <strong>Pro Video Formats</strong> &amp; <strong>FxPlug SDK</strong> also got an update. The <strong>Workflow Extensions</strong> SDK did not.</p>
<p>There's lots of great videos out there talking about this update, such as:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>FCPXML:</strong></p>
<p>There have been no changes/updates to FCPXML in this update - it still uses <strong>FCPXML v1.11</strong>.</p>
<p>Sadly this means that FCPXML is still broken with certain text parameters - for example, <strong>Tracking</strong>, <strong>All Caps Size</strong>, <strong>Z Position</strong>, etc. don't translate properly in FCPXML:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scrolling Timeline:</strong></p>
<p>The most exciting change to Final Cut Pro 10.7 is the addition of a <strong>Scrolling Timeline</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcp10-7-scrolling-timeline.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CommandPost has had a scrolling timeline in Final Cut Pro since 2016.</p>
<p>FWIW - the CommandPost scrolling timeline still works in Final Cut Pro 10.7, so you can still keep using it if you prefer it to the official scrolling timeline.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, in an very early version of CommandPost, we also had a feature called <strong>Timeline Playhead Lock</strong>, which locked the timeline playhead to the centre of the timeline - but this feature was removed at some point as very few people actually used it.</p>
<p>You've also been able to turn on <strong>Enable Rendering During Playback</strong> so that Final Cut Pro keeps rendering, analysing, and generating thumbnails and waveforms even during playback - which works great in combination with CommandPost's scrolling timeline.</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-preferences.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The new Scrolling Timeline in Final Cut Pro 10.7 is definitely a big improvement from what CommandPost can offer, and is a really nice implementation, as you'll see in the various videos linked to above. Richard Taylor is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByDrUiZD57w">VERY happy</a>.</p>
<p>What's interesting though is that when you enable the scrolling timeline, it also enables Final Cut Pro's ability to generate thumbnails and waveforms during playback - and when you turn off the scrolling timeline it disables this ability.</p>
<p>It's also interesting that the scrolling timeline is disabled by default.</p>
<p>A scrolling timeline has been referenced inside Final Cut Pro for years now. My GUESS the reason it's taken so long for Apple to enable and release publicly is because they've been waiting for the hardware to catch up.</p>
<p>This also explains why it's disabled by default (along with generating thumbnails &amp; waveforms during playback), as it runs pretty slow/laggy on very complex projects/timelines, especially on older Intel hardware, and Apple don't want new users to experience that straight out of the box - hence scrolling timeline is &quot;hidden&quot; in the preferences, and not with a simple toolbar button.</p>
<p>I'm sure eventually, once you can no longer install the latest macOS and Final Cut Pro on Intel machines, then Apple will make generating thumbnails &amp; waveforms during playback always on - not just when you have the scrolling timeline enabled.</p>
<p>Once this happens, maybe they'll add a Scrolling Timeline toggle next to the Skimming button in the Timeline Toolbar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, CommandPost's <strong>Enable Rendering During Playback</strong> preference still seems to work on Final Cut Pro 10.7, which is great.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you <strong>never</strong> want to use the new scrolling timeline, but still want to generate thumbnails and waveforms during playback without CommandPost, you can also use this Terminal command:</p>
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.FinalCut FFGenerateThumbnailsDuringPlayback -bool true
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you turn on the scrolling timeline and then turn it off again, <code>FFGenerateThumbnailsDuringPlayback</code> will also be disabled again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Library Database:</strong></p>
<p>The Final Cut Pro Library Database version has also been updated to <code>1090</code>, compared to <code>1071</code> in Final Cut Pro 10.6.10.</p>
<p>This means that any Libraries created prior to Final Cut Pro 10.7 will need to be updated to the latest format, and you can't go back from 10.7 to earlier versions of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro does always do an automatic backup of libraries prior to updating them, we also <strong>strongly recommend</strong> manually creating a ZIP file of your library before updating too, so that you can roll back to an older version of Final Cut Pro if a major bug or regression is found.</p>
<p>The <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#backups-for-final-cut-pro">Backups for Final Cut Pro</a> application is also highly regarded for automating library backups.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3 also uses the <code>1090</code> database format - so Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad are once again in version parity.</p>
<p><s>Unfortunately for us, Final Cut Pro for iPad has become less interesting after Apple prevented <strong>Transfer Toolbox</strong> from working - which was our solution to get from Mac to iPad.</s></p>
<p><s>We've since stopped developing Transfer Toolbox for now - you can read more about this decision in more detail <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">here</a>.</s></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (3rd Dec 2023):</strong> After writing this news entry, we've since brought back Transfer Toolbox to life with Final Cut Pro 10.7 support. You can learn more <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our big hope/dream with Final Cut Pro for iPad was to use it for doing director/client/agency selects, and then send those selects to the Mac, but ideally we want to do all the prep work on Mac - i.e. syncing everything with Sync-N-Link, etc.</p>
<p>You can easily get from Final Cut Pro on iPad to Mac, so we're now exploring ways to take the selects from iPad and translate them across to Multicam Clips created in Sync-N-Link (for example).</p>
<p>The fact that you can now import <strong>iMovie for iOS</strong> projects into Final Cut Pro for iPad might be a hint that native Mac to iPad is also on their radar/wish-list.</p>
<p>Apple still publicly advertise that Third-party Content is coming soon to Final Cut Pro for iPad - so we should see third party MotionVFX Motion Templates on iPad at some point in 2024:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Command Sets:</strong></p>
<p>The only two Command Editor items between Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and 10.7.0 are <strong>Collapse to Connected Storyline</strong> and <strong>Timeline Scrolling</strong>.</p>
<p>They did however follow the more recent macOS naming conventions, and renamed the <strong>Preferences</strong> item to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>They also replaced a lot of <strong>OS X</strong> to <strong>macOS</strong> in various warnings and error messages.</p>
<p>The built-in default Command Set also has had a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collapse to Connected Storyline</strong> has been added as <strong>COMMAND+SHIFT+DOWN</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Set Monitoring Angle</strong> has changed from <strong>SHIFT+V</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Start/Stop Voiceover Recording</strong> has changed from <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+A</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+R</strong> (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).</li>
<li><strong>Record Voiceover</strong> has changed from <strong>COMMAND+OPTION+8</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+V</strong> (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Reveal in Browser:</strong></p>
<p>It's worth noting that the enhanced <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> feature allows you to locate a clip in the Browser without losing your selected Keyword Collection or Smart Collection.</p>
<p>However, if no Keyword or Smart Collection is currently selected, it will still just match back to the Event.</p>
<p>For a number of years now, CommandPost has had a <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> action:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you trigger <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> on a clip in the timeline that has multiple keywords applied to it, it will prompt you for which one you want to reveal to:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection-selection.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This feature still works great on Final Cut Pro 10.7, and can be handy when you want to quickly match back to a Keyword Collection, rather than an Event.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faster HEVC &amp; H.264 Exports:</strong></p>
<p>Faster HEVC and H.264 export will only happen if you're using macOS Sonoma and a Mac with Apple M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2 Max, M2 Ultra, or M3 Max.</p>
<p>It works by <strong>simultaneously</strong> processing video segments across available media engines, but it will only split up video to the different media engines if the content is long.</p>
<p>For example, you won't get faster exports if you have a 30sec or 1min timeline, but a feature length film you'll see improvements.</p>
<p>Because an export is essentially &quot;split up&quot; into multiple chunks for different media engines, there's also some time spent at the end of the process to &quot;combine&quot; the chunks again. Whilst this is all done in the hardware, there's still some overhead, which is why it won't split things up for shorter clips (as you'll waste time combining them at the end).</p>

<p>The Command Set Import window now only accepts <code>.commandset</code> files! This was reported as <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/236">FB12868396</a>. Thanks Apple!</p>
<p>The relink progress bar has been improved, so that the progress bar doesn't &quot;block&quot; the Relink panel interface. This means that as things relink in the progress bar, you can visually see things get removed in the matched files list.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p>
<p>Whilst so far Final Cut Pro 10.7 has been pretty stable and reliable, I've still seen it do some funky things.</p>
<p>For example, random red lines in the Timeline for no apparent reason:</p>
<p><img src="/static/random-red-lines.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you see something similar, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/285">FB13434993</a>.</p>
<p>The Scrolling Timeline sometimes misbehaves at certain Zoom Levels. This is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/294">FB13436367</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Alex4D/status/1730929760962777529">Some users have reported</a> that Final Cut Pro thinks a QWERTY keyboard is attached, when instead a AZERTY keyboard is.</p>
<p>If you're using a AZERTY keyboard, we would suggest backing up your custom Command Sets prior to updating to Final Cut Pro 10.7, so that you can import them back in.</p>
<p>I've been able to make it crash using third party Audio Units, even after selecting <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Audio Units &gt; Validate on Next Launch</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, since at least Final Cut Pro 10.6.10, <strong>Send To Compressor</strong> doesn't correctly render any third-party audio effects.</p>
<p>If you can reproduce, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/287">FB13435050</a>.</p>
<p>The Inspector button tooltips have disappeared - it now just says:</p>
<p><img src="/static/missing-tooltips.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you can reproduce, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/286">FB13435003</a>.</p>
<p>When first installing Final Cut Pro 10.7 it had the code name for ProRes Proxy in the Rendering Dropdown:</p>
<p><img src="/static/bad-label-for-prores-proxy.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since seeing this, ProRes Proxy is no longer an option in the Rendering Dropbox.</p>
<p>When trying to change a font, the font variation popup menu would sometimes loose it's text, and you couldn't select a different variation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when this is happening and you hover over the empty popup menu items, the render bars above the selected Title go crazy.</p>
<p><img src="/static/disappearing-menu-items.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This could prove to be a <strong>major regression</strong> - but we need to do some more testing to confirm exactly what's going on. So far some other users have been able to reproduce this, so it looks like a bug sadly.</p>
<p>If you can reproduce this issue, please let us know in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/284">FB13434977</a>.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, it's been pretty rock solid - even when enabling the Scrolling Timeline on our massive Blackmagic RAW test timeline, which is full of all kinds of weird and wonderful BRAW clips in all different types of frame sizes, frame rates and aspect ratios.</p>
<p>We'll continue to test and explore Final Cut Pro 10.7 over the coming weeks and report any findings on FCP Cafe.</p>
<p>If you spot any bugs or issues, please make sure you report them on the <a href="/bugtracker/">Bug Tracker</a>. Thanks team!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>X2Pro5</strong> is out now on the Mac App Store at a discounted introductory rate (<strong>USD$50 off</strong>) for <strong>two weeks only</strong>!</p>
<p>The original <strong>X2Pro</strong> will remain on sale, as X2Pro5 only works on macOS Ventura &amp; Sonoma.</p>
<p>It's been completely re-written and redesigned with the following new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Apple silicon support</li>
<li>Expanded roles</li>
<li>Enhanced media management</li>
<li>Simple workflow via redesigned UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Marquis’ new X2Pro5 software has been designed to integrate Final Cut Pro projects into a professional audio workflow, enabling Avid Pro Tools to be used for audio finishing. It works by converting the exported Final Cut Pro XML into an AAF file, which Avid Pro Tools can then open as a session, delivering seamless integration between the two applications.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 is a complete rewrite of Marquis’ popular X2Pro Audio Convert software, bringing with it native Apple silicon support and a redesigned user interface.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 takes advantage of the innovative metadata-based organising features in Final Cut Pro X, with expanded role management allowing unlimited numbers of audio roles in Final Cut Pro X to be converted into Pro Tools tracks for further audio processing and finishing by the audio engineer.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 has a simple, straightforward interface and is easy to customise; for example, you can decide if you want to include disabled or inactive clips in the export, and you can choose the length of frame handles. The software provides a fully professional audio workflow for Final Cut Pro editors, enabling a very complex audio timeline to be sent to the Pro Tools audio engineer with ease.X2Pro5 faithfully translates your audio timeline along with L-cuts, J-cuts, transitions, levels, automatic gain and fade handles, as well as the incredibly powerful FCP X compound and multicam clips. Transitions are converted into linear cross fades. Audio media can be any QuickTime supported audio, non-PCM audio is converted to PCM at either 16 or 24 bit.</p>
<p>With immersive audio technology continuing to grow in popularity, X2Pro5 provides a quick way for FCP users to be able to deliver a project to an external Pro Tools audio editor, sharing the FCPXML file so they can mix – and deliver – multi-channel audio.</p>
<p>R3D media is supported.</p>
<p>We recommend rendering an off-line or proxy version of the flattened video and exporting that if a reference is needed within Pro Tools. Only audio media is translated by X2Pro5.</p>
<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro X, and FCPXML from v1.7</li>
<li>macOS 13 Ventura and later. X2Pro5 is tested on the latest release macOS and the previous release.</li>
<li>Pro Tools v7.0 or later for AAF import (not LE versions, v7 and v8 require Digitranslator for AAF import)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can purchase on the Mac App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/x2pro5/id6467014654?mt=12">here</a>.</p>
