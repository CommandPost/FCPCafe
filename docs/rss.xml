            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

<p>We're still working on the formatting - they're currently a bit &quot;buggy&quot; in terms of automatically resizing, and sometimes require a hard page reset to appear properly. We're investigating a proper fix - stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta</strong> with 14-bit MIDI CC is <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/">now available</a>.</p>
<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commentary Head of Editing:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been so incredibly exciting watching all the professional editors contributing to this site via GitHub (check out these <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">closed pull requests</a>!).</p>
<p>I proposed creating <a href="https://avid.cafe">avid.cafe</a> and <a href="https://premiere.cafe">premiere.cafe</a>/<a href="https://premierepro.cafe">premierepro.cafe</a> on some big Facebook Communities and my posts were <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1664442143262543872">pretty quickly removed</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569">crazy spur-of-the-moment idea</a>, and gone full steam ahead - love it!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new <strong>MediaExtension</strong> Framework, which is <strong>BIG NEWS</strong> for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.</p>
<p>This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support.</p>
<p>This means that for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!</p>
<p>We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox</strong> v1.1.4 (51) is <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">now available</a> on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.</p>
<p>Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.</p>
<p>As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> the default option as a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a <strong>Custom</strong> Solids Generator.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.</p>
<p>We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.</p>
<p>To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a <strong>Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)</strong> Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.</p>
<p>HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.</p>
<p>We'll leave <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Russ Hughes has written a great blog post titled: <strong>I Ignored Davinci Resolve - I Was Wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>It explains why he jumped from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve for editing, from a sound designers perspective.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/i-ignored-davinci-resolve-i-was-wrong">here</a>.</p>
<p>For context, for the stuff <a href="https://latenitefilms.com">LateNite</a> does Final Cut Pro is still king, for the simple fact that it’s the most fun and most creative tool to edit with.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve is INSANELY powerful, and Blackmagic is a much more friendly company to work with than Apple.</p>
<p>However, I personally feel like I'm an engineer when using Resolve, whereas in Final Cut Pro I feel like an artist.</p>
<p>You can do amazing things in both tools - but Final Cut Pro feels like the better instrument for creative flow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just to keep you on your toes...</p>
<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.2.2 (54)</strong> is out now, with some internal improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a bunch of additional checks to the FxPlug4 Renderer, to ensure that all objects received from the Blackmagic RAW SDK are valid and correct to avoid any potential crashes due to referencing null pointers. Thanks for reporting Dominik Radecki! Big thanks to the Blackmagic RAW team and Final Cut Pro team for all their help and support!</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've thrown together a simple Python script called <strong>Rename Avid MXF Files</strong>.</p>
<p>It's used to rename MXF files generated by Avid Media Composer to match the <strong>Package Name</strong> in their metadata.</p>
<p>The script can process a <strong>single file</strong> or a folder containing <strong>multiple</strong> MXF files.</p>
<p>This is useful if you want to move native Avid MXF files from Avid Media Composer to Final Cut Pro.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses an issue where audio effects would not be reset during playback.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an Audio Units effect could have incorrect values when importing using FCPXML.</li>
<li>Improves waveform redrawing on expanded audio components when adjusting volume with the Touch Bar.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where the Voice Isolation Amount slider would snap to 0% when trying to set a value less than 7%.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with the Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Control Range setting in the Color Adjustments effect would be incorrectly set to SDR when importing using FCPXML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this update requires a database update, so there must be some bigger changes under the hood.</p>
<p><img src="/static/database-update.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad 1.1</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn snapping on or off using the keyboard shortcut N.</li>
<li>Move the playhead backward or forward 10 frames using the keyboard shortcuts Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow.</li>
<li>Show info for browser clips using the keyboard shortcut Control-I.</li>
<li>Turn skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut S.</li>
<li>Turn audio skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut Shift-S.</li>
<li>Split and switch multicam clip angles using the keyboard shortcuts 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>Show or hide the jog wheel using the keyboard shortcut Control-Shift-W; expand or collapse it using Control-W.</li>
<li>Switch the jog wheel between playhead mode and nudge mode using the keyboard shortcut Shift-W.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with custom fonts not appearing in the inspector.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when dragging a clip from the browser to the timeline.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue with keyboard shortcuts not working as expected in the content browser.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback when adding effects and transitions to timeline clips in Position mode.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where importing media on a device with no remaining storage would cause Final Cut Pro for iPad to quit unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where importing clips with the same name would generate blank clip thumbnails.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when using soundtracks and dynamic titles.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where copying and pasting transform settings would unexpectedly paste clip speed.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback and reliability when rating and adding keywords to clips while filtering clips in the browser.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where resetting audio settings would unexpectedly reset clip speed.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with the appearance of onscreen controls for cropping and shape masks.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where clip height adjustments would not update audio-only clips in connected storylines.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Keywords window would open offscreen with the timeline minimized.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where disabled multicam audio angles would appear in the audio component list in the inspector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 on Mac uses a newer Library format than Final Cut Pro 1.1 on iPad. This means that if you want to use Transfer Toolbox to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using Final Cut Pro 10.6.6.</p>
<p><strong>Compressor 4.6.5</strong> is out now with the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Settings and Locations sidebar to now be resizable when the Inspector is open.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when processing 4:2:2-based H.264 media on Mac computers with Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where the color space of a Photo-JPEG source was incorrect when Color space was set to Automatic.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an exported IMF supplemental package was one frame shorter than the original package.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motion 5.6.5</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves stability with FxPlug 4 plug-ins.</li>
<li>Improves stability when dragging a group that contains an FxPlug plug-in to the Favorites folder.</li>
<li>Improves performance when using the Sequence Text behavior with Anchor Point set to Line (in the Layout pane of the Text Inspector).</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited to test it out, and see if there's other undocumented fixes and improvements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[20th July 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been cutting all day with <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a fresh job (i.e. not something migrated from 10.6.6), and it has a LOT of third-party Motion Templates, effects, random still images, random videos in a variety of formats, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst I was able to successfully edit, and export without too many dramas, 10.6.7 definitely seems more buggy and unreliable than 10.6.6.</p>
<p>I had to manually quit and restart Final Cut Pro quite a few times throughout the day because the Viewer was just black. Nothing I could do would bring it back to life, apart from a restart.</p>
<p>This is consistent with other professional long-form editors I've chatted to.</p>
<p>After one of the restarts, after applying an cut to an audio clip, and adding a transition, suddenly the Viewer went &quot;strobing&quot; - again, requiring another manual restart.</p>
<p>I haven't had any crashes, but it's definitely got... issues.</p>
<p>One major <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/217">confirmed bug</a> is that Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 doesn't properly respect 0% opacity in Motion Templates. For example, if you apply the <code>Placeholder</code> Generator, it will ALWAYS show the notes:</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpx-10-6-7-bug.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This could be a deal breaker if you're using a Motion Template that uses this technique to hide things. Luckily none of the Motion Templates I used today had any issues.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)</strong> uses a newer Library format than <strong>Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to use <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a> to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)</strong>.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to stick with Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 for now, and wait for another bug fix in a few weeks time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>From the team behind Audio Design Design, <strong>SoundGen</strong> is a generative AI experience that turns your text prompts into music and art, with the option to download the files and add them into your film and audio projects.</p>
<p>The beta program is entirely free for you to use and experiment with. As SoundGen matures, the developers will be integrating it directly into <strong>Audio Design Desk</strong>.</p>
<p>Their goal is to give their users access to an even broader collection of sounds on demand, right within the DAW.</p>
<p>The alpha version can only do a maximum of 30 seconds. Depending on the prompt, sometimes it can found great, other times it's very computer generated. It'll definitely improve dramatically over time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.8</strong> is now available on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p>The release notes only have one line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixes an issue where video could freeze in the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, based on early reports, this release seems to fix the various crashes that users were reporting too, in addition to the Viewer sometimes going black or strobing.</p>
<p>If you're currently using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier</strong> we recommend sticking with that for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if you're using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> we recommend updating.</p>
<p>Please make sure you make a backup of your Final Cut Pro application by creating a <code>ZIP</code> file of it, before updating. You should also manually backup any libraries before updating.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've just released a very niche new app to the Mac App Store called <strong>Fast Collections</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>thousands of keywords</strong> across many events, it can take a long time to create a new Smart Collection with your preferred keywords directly within Final Cut Pro - but with <strong>Fast Collections</strong>, it can now take seconds.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Luke Nash</strong> is an up-and-coming Final Cut Pro &amp; Motion Developer who's currently working on some awesome new tools to help with building complex user interfaces in <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/motion/">Apple Motion</a> easier, faster and more powerful.</p>
<p>His latest project, <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, is an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/fxplug?language=objc">FxPlug4</a> plugin that works in Apple Motion to provide a powerful rectangular on-screen control that can be used and combined with other Apple Motion effects. For example, if you wanted to build a colour correction tool with powerful masking features, you could use <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> to allow your users to draw masks via an on-screen tool in the Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro Viewer.</p>
<p>Whilst <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> has been written in Objective-C using the FxPlug4 API (Apple Motion's Effects API for third party developers) - it's easily accessible within Apple's Motion, just like regular built-in tools, so anyone who's making Motion Templates in Apple Motion can make use of this functionality without knowing any code. Essentially these are tools to make it easier for people to make awesome Motion Templates, which can then be &quot;exposed&quot; in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Luke is currently demonstrating <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> via a series of YouTube videos, with the intention of trying to raise funds to cover a new Mac and Apple Developer Account via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">this Indiegogo campaign</a>. If he can raise the necessary funds to finish <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, he will release the software for free, and potentially even open-source.</p>
<p>There are very few FxPlug4 developers in the world, especially in terms of solo indie developers - so it's awesome to see Luke really tackling uncharted territory. These tools could potentially be game-changers to the growing list of Final Cut Pro YouTuber's that are also building their own Motion Templates to sell.</p>
<p><strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> is still very much a work-in-progress, with a beta build hopefully coming in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> and his other <strong>Luke’s Got Groups</strong> project <a href="https://lukesgotbrains.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the Indiegogo project <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7th September 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our good friend <strong>Bradley Andrew</strong>, founder of <a href="https://filmdrives.com">FilmDrives</a> and creator of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/crew-call/id1532198878">Crew Call</a>, has just released a really exciting new iPad App onto TestFlight.</p>
<p><img src="/static/video-assist-logo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Whilst this isn't strictly Final Cut Pro related - I'm sure it'll be of interest to many of the Final Cut Pro Community - especially those shooting, as well as editing. There's a whole world of possibilities here, for both production and post.</p>
<p><strong>Video Assist</strong> allows you to use your iPad as an external monitor and recording device with compatible USB Capture Cards.</p>
<p>You can easily record videos or capture frame grabs from any HDMI Video Source. SDI Video Sources are also supported with specific capture cards.</p>
<p>Video Tools such as Color Correction, Transform, Grid Lines, Center Marks and Aspect Ratio Masks are built-in.</p>
<p><strong>Record Trigger</strong> is supported for all ARRI Alexa and Sony Venice Cameras via a custom computer vision model.</p>
<p>Support for RED and Blackmagic Cameras will be coming prior to public launch.</p>
<p>Only yesterday Bradley built <strong>RGB &amp; Luminance Histograms</strong> into the app and has enabled a clean video output from the iPad. This means you can use your iPad as a recorder and then output a clean video feed of live or playback via a USB-C to HDMI Adaptor or via AirPlay.</p>
<p>To date, the only way to use your iPad as a monitor is via a <a href="https://qtakehd.com/hardware/screenport/">QTake ScreenPort</a> or the <a href="https://accsoon.com/accsoon-seemo/">Accsoon SeeMo</a> range.</p>
<p>This app-based approach is super exciting, as it allows people to use off-the-shelf hardware to turn under-utilised USB-C iPads into great displays.</p>
<p>USB Capture Cards range from $20-$250 depending on compatible resolutions, so they are well within reach for most people.</p>
<p>You can watch a short demo of the app in action on YouTube:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KxTDOyLeWQ"><img src="/static/video-assist-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Bradley is super lovely and insanely talented, and <strong>Video Assist</strong> is such a great implementation - you can tell he's had decades of experience in the camera department, as the user interface is so familiar and easy to use.</p>
<p>We've been chatting with Bradley about all the possibilities for hooking up his app to Frame.io and Final Cut Pro for more seamless exchanges of favourites/selects and on-set notes. Exciting times!</p>
<p>If you are curious and want to test it for yourself on a <strong>USB-C iPad running iPadOS 17 Beta</strong>, you can try the pre-release version via Apple TestFlight <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/vgjAL68x">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s iPhone Media Event is scheduled for 12th September, and typically new iOS versions go live the day after the event or at the end of that week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Apple released updates to Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro for iPad, Motion and Pro Video Formats.</p>
<p>These updates drop support for macOS Monterey - only macOS Ventura and Sonoma are now supported, which is disappointing, but not surprising.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we've already had reports from <a href="https://fxfactory.com">FxFactory</a> that the Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 update has at least one serious bug.</p>
<p><strong>FxFactory</strong> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 is now available on the Mac App Store. This version breaks all FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.</p>
<p>Regrettably this constitutes the entirety of our catalog featuring object tracking or face detection, since developers and users alike have come to favor the Title layer for its flexibility.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of products affected, we recommend that you do not apply this update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read more about this bug <a href="https://fxfactory.com/news/finalcutpro-10.6.9-skip-the-update/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, Apple doesn't provide beta releases to most third party developers, so it's a mad scramble to test and review updates once they're made public.</p>
<p>We're currently in the process of testing and reviewing all the updates, and will post more on FCP Cafe as new things come to light.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For developers, Apple has also updated the FxPlug 4 SDK.</p>
<p>At this stage, there's been no update to the Workflow Extensions SDK (currently at v1.0.2, released in January).</p>
<p>The <strong>FxPlug 4.2.8 SDK</strong> includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of unsupported FxPlug 3 properties from the FxPlug framework</li>
<li>Support for GPU and backwards analysis in the <code>FxBrightnessAnalysis</code> example</li>
<li>Plug-ins built with newer SDKs now handle canceling of analysis without crashing in older hosts.</li>
<li>The template and example properties have been updated to conform to the removal of some FxPlug 3 properties. This includes the <code>kFxPropertyKey_UsesRationalTime</code> and <code>kFxPropertyKey_IsThreadSafe</code> properties.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when an FxPlug 4 plug-in with custom UI displayed in the inspector crashed, or was terminated by the OS. It will now redraw its custom controls immediately rather than waiting until the next communication with the plug-in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with a potential crash when using the <code>FxColorGamutAPI</code>.</li>
<li>Analysis no longer returns frames with a 1-pixel border around them.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections-1-1-0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>This was originally intended to be a very niche application, primarily used by long-form documentary editors.</p>
<p>However, as requested by Vigneswaran Rajkumar, we've added the ability to <strong>Generate</strong> a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc.</p>
<p>This is very handy for long-form projects, so to make the application more accessible, we're also reduced the price to a one-time payment of <strong>USD$9.99</strong> on the <strong>Mac App Store</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Picture This</strong> allows you to harnesses the power of Generative AI to create unlimited, copyright free images from a Final Cut Pro Project right on your Mac, using the latest version of Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-01.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-02.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-03.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>To quote the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create stunning AI text-to-image artwork from Markers in your Final Cut Pro Projects or Premiere Pro Sequences. Picture This… takes the text-to-image prompts from Markers in a Project or Sequence and generates image variations for each prompt, and returns these images to Final Cut Pro as a new Project with Auditions, or to higher tracks in a Premiere Pro Sequence, for easy comparison.</p>
<p>Using the latest version of Stable Diffusion, Picture This… provides background batch processing of images and the convenience of Auditions in your Final Cut Pro Projects.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong>
Create your prompts where you will use them: in red Markers in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Processes as a Batch in the Background</strong>
Batch processing allows to you use your time productively while Picture This… — your “art department” — does it’s AI magic.
Important: Do not continue working on that timeline. Any work you do on your edit will not be included in the results returned from Picture This…</p>
<p><strong>Aligned in your Edit</strong>
New images display right where you need them in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong>
Use multiple passes to hone in on the image you need. Optionally, fine tune the prompt each time.
Images are always free, whether you generate one or 1000.
Processing happens on your local Mac, never in the cloud.</p>
<p>Images cannot be copyright individually, but do not limit the copyright on the finished project.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong>
In Final Cut Pro enter your image description (text-to-image prompt) in a To-Do Marker where you want the image to start. Or in Premiere Pro, add a red Sequence Marker with a prompt. Images continue to the next Marker or to the end of the underlying clip.
Export and Import XML, or drag a Project (FCP only) to Picture This….
