            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569">crazy spur-of-the-moment idea</a>, and gone full steam ahead - love it!</p>

<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>
<h4>Trailer</h4>
<p>You can watch the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9uRBf6o_IA">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Commentary Head of Editing</h4>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>We're still working on the formatting - they're currently a bit &quot;buggy&quot; in terms of automatically resizing, and sometimes require a hard page reset to appear properly. We're investigating a proper fix - stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta</strong> with 14-bit MIDI CC is <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/">now available</a>.</p>
<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>
