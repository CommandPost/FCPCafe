<p>FCPXMLs were sent to DaVinci Resolve for colour grading and X2Pro was used to send AAFs to ProTools for mixing. The sound designer was very impressed with the neatness of the timeline.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commentary Head of Editing:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been so incredibly exciting watching all the professional editors contributing to this site via GitHub (check out these <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">closed pull requests</a>!).</p>
<p>I proposed creating <a href="https://avid.cafe">avid.cafe</a> and <a href="https://premiere.cafe">premiere.cafe</a>/<a href="https://premierepro.cafe">premierepro.cafe</a> on some big Facebook Communities and my posts were <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1664442143262543872">pretty quickly removed</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569">crazy spur-of-the-moment idea</a>, and gone full steam ahead - love it!</p>
<p>Thanks team!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new <strong>MediaExtension</strong> Framework, which is <strong>BIG NEWS</strong> for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.</p>
<p>This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support.</p>
<p>This means that for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!</p>
<p>We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox</strong> v1.1.4 (51) is <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">now available</a> on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.</p>
<p>Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.</p>
<p>As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> the default option as a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a <strong>Custom</strong> Solids Generator.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.</p>
<p>We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.</p>
<p>To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a <strong>Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)</strong> Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.</p>
<p>HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.</p>
<p>We'll leave <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.</p>
