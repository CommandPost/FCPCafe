### How do I customize the interface in Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro offers several ways to customize the interface to better suit your workflow. Here are some of the key ways you can customize the interface:

**Workspaces:**

Final Cut Pro includes a number of pre-defined workspaces, which are layouts of the interface that are tailored to different types of tasks, like color grading, audio editing, and more. You can switch between these at any time by going to Window > Workspaces. You can also save your own custom workspaces by arranging the interface how you like, then going to Window > Workspaces > Save Workspace As.

**Viewer & Timeline:**

You can adjust the size of the Viewer and the Timeline by dragging the border between them. You can also adjust the size of the clips in the timeline by using the Clip Appearance button at the bottom right of the timeline.

**Browser & Inspector:**

The Browser and Inspector can be shown or hidden depending on your needs. You can show or hide the Browser by pressing Command-1, and the Inspector by pressing Command-4. You can also adjust the size of these panels by dragging their borders.

**Secondary Display:**

If you have a secondary display, you can use it to extend your workspace. Go to Window > Show in Secondary Display to select what you want to display on the second screen.

Remember, the best layout depends on your specific needs and workflow. Feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.
