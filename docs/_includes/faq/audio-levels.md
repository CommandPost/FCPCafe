### Audio Levels - How to handle?

There’s multiple methods of changing levels of single clips or a selection of clips. 

The fastest way would be using the shortcuts CNTRL + or - to in- or decrease levels in 1 dB increments. You can of course change levels of selected clips in the Audio Inspector via slider or numerical dB-Input and in the timeline via the horizontal volume control line (drag with mouse, for precise control press CMD while dragging). You also can level a portion of a clip by selecting a range (Range-Tool: press R) and then drag the line. This creates 4 keyframes around the region.
    
If you got a Clip, Sync Clip or Multicam Clip with multichannel Audio you can also use these methods to level single channels, either in the Audio Inspector or via right mouse click “Expand Audio Components” or by pressing cntrl+cmd+S. If you put your edit into a Compound Clip you can also level out the different Roles you’ve got in your edit, separately. 
   
Theres also advanced built-in Audio Effects for cleaning and automatic levels your Audio in the Inspector, as well as additional Effects in the Effects Browser for these purposes, including Equalizers, Compressors, Limiters and broadcast-safe level meters (search for: Multi Meter).<br> 
  
It’s even possible to mix in 5.1 Sorround, see: [Audio Editing](https://fcp.cafe/faq/#audio-editing---do-i-need-a-separate-app)
