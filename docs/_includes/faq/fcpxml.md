### FCPXML - Overview

fcpxml is FCP's proprietary file format for sending timelines or even entire libraries to third party apps and plugins. It opens Final Cut to the rest of the world and even to other NLEs, like daVinci Resolve.

Have a look at [tools](https://fcp.cafe/ecosystem/tools/) to get an impression what's possible with fcpxml.

Final Cut usually supports the current and the previous version of fcpxml. example: 10.9 and 10.10. You'd be well advised to use the previous version, because it's usually supported by a wider range of Apps.
