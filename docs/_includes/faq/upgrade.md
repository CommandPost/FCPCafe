### How do I upgrade to the latest version of Final Cut Pro?

You can download the latest version of Final Cut Pro from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12){target="_blank"}.

However, we always recommend creating a ZIP file of your previous Final Cut Pro version before updating, incase there's a bug or issue that requires you to roll back.
