### Upgrade/Update Strategy

You can download the latest version of Final Cut Pro from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12){target="_blank"}.

However, we always recommend creating a ZIP file of your previous Final Cut Pro version before updating, in case there's a bug or issue that requires you to roll back or you want to open older libraries
Some updates also update the library file to make it compatible with new features. In this case going back is only possible via fcpxml export. This can be tricky.
Do not update during a critical phase of a project!
