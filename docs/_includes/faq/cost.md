### Money - How much does it cost?

You can find the latest pricing information on the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12){target="_blank"}.

Though Final Cut Pro has everything you need to edit and share your video projects we want to point out that professional workflows may demand additional Plugins and Apps.

We recommend at least:

- [Sync-N-Link](/ecosystem/tools/#sync-n-link-x) - Batch-sync Audio with Video and Metadata
- [X2Pro](/ecosystem/tools/#x2pro) - AAF Audio deliveries to [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools){target="_blank"}
- [PostLab](/ecosystem/tools/#postlab) - collaboration with other Editors and Assistant Editors

You can learn about these and many others on this site under [Tools](/ecosystem/tools/) and [Plugins](/ecosystem/plugins/).
