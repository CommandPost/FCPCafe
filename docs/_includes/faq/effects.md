### Effects - Overview

Final Cut Pro comes with a variety of built-in effects that you can apply to your video clips. These include:

1. **Video Effects**: There's a broad range of video effects available in Final Cut Pro, including color corrections, distortions, blurs, stylistic effects, and more. Some popular ones include "Vintage" effects for a retro look, "Keying" effects for green screen work, and "Light" effects for flares and glows.

2. **Audio Effects**: Final Cut Pro also includes a variety of audio effects. These include EQ filters, noise reduction tools, reverbs, echoes, and more.

3. **Transitions**: Transitions are a type of effect that you can place between clips. Final Cut Pro includes various transition effects such as dissolves, wipes, slides, and more complex 3D transitions.

4. **Text and Generators**: Final Cut Pro includes several types of text effects and motion graphics generators. These include title effects, credits, lower thirds, backgrounds, and more.

5. **Keying and Compositing**: Final Cut Pro includes powerful tools for keying and compositing, which are used to remove backgrounds (such as with green screen footage) or combine multiple layers of video.

6. **Speed and Time effects**: With these effects, you can slow down or speed up your clips, create freeze frames, and even reverse your footage.

7. **Color Grading**: Final Cut Pro has advanced color grading tools, including color wheels, color curves, hue/saturation curves, and custom LUTs.

8. **Stabilization and Correction**: These effects help fix issues with your footage, such as shaky camera work or lens distortion.

9. **360° Video Effects**: If you're working with 360° video, Final Cut Pro has several effects specifically designed for this format.

Remember that you can further expand FCP's capabilities with third-party plugins. These can provide additional effects, transitions, and other capabilities. As with any effect, it's important to use these tools judiciously; while they can enhance your project, overuse can be distracting to the viewer.
