### Animations - Overview

Final Cut Pro is a robust tool that allows for a variety of animations, both simple and complex. Here's an overview of the types of animations you can create in Final Cut Pro:

1. **Text and Titles**: Final Cut Pro has a comprehensive set of tools for creating animated text and titles. You can animate text to fly in, fade in, spin, and much more, and control exactly when and how these animations happen.

2. **Transitions**: You can create animated transitions between clips. This could be as simple as a cross dissolve, or something more complex like a 3D cube spin or page peel.

3. **Keyframe Animations**: You can animate virtually any visual aspect of a video clip or effect using keyframes. Keyframes allow you to set specific values for certain parameters (like position, scale, or opacity) at specific points in time. Final Cut Pro then animates the change in these parameters over time.

4. **Effects and Filters**: Final Cut Pro includes a variety of effects and filters that can be animated, like blurs, color changes, distortions, and more. see also [Effects](/faq/#what-kind-of-effects-can-i-add-using-final-cut-pro).

5. **Motion Paths**: You can animate objects to move along a specific path over time.

6. **3D Animations**: Although FCP doesn't include full 3D modeling tools, it does allow you to create some 3D animations. For example, you can animate 2D images or text in 3D space.

7. **Animations with Motion**: If you need more advanced animation capabilities, you can use Apple's Motion software, which integrates seamlessly with Final Cut Pro. Motion allows for more complex animations, including particle systems, replicators, and much more.

Remember, while FCP offers a lot of animation capabilities, it's primarily a video editing tool. If you're looking to create more complex animations or motion graphics, you might want to consider using a tool that's specifically designed for animation, like Adobe After Effects or Apple's Motion.
