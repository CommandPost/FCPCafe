### What is Apple's Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software application developed by Apple. It provides non-linear, non-destructive editing of any QuickTime-compatible video format, including DV, HDV, P2 MXF (DVCProHD), XDCAM (via plug-in), 2K, 4K and 5K film formats, and can import projects directly from iMovie for iOS.

Key features of Final Cut Pro include:

1. **Magnetic Timeline**: This feature lets you move and trim clips without causing collisions or sync problems, making for a more efficient editing process.
2. **Multicam Support**: This allows you to automatically sync up to 64 angles of video and photos to create multicam clips.
3. **360-Degree VR Editing**: You can edit 360-degree footage and see the results in real-time with a VR headset.
4. **Advanced Color Grading**: Final Cut Pro offers professional color grading tools to give you precise control over the color settings in your video.
5. **Motion Graphics and Effects**: You can create stunning effects and sweeping graphics with Motion, including studio-quality 2D and 3D titles you can open and adjust in Final Cut Pro.
6. **VR Headset Playback**: You can view your 360-degree video in real time with a connected VR headset.
7. **Asset Management**: Clip Connections allow you to keep related clips together, making it easy to place items such as B-roll, sound effects, and music in the timeline.

Final Cut Pro is available only on macOS and it's sold as a one-time purchase rather than a subscription.
