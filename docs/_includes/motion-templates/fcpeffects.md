### FCPeffects

In July 2011, Turner & Emma launched **FCPeffects.com** in an effort to help Final Cut Pro editors work more efficiently and effectively on a tight budget.

They continue to take pride in offering powerful tools at affordable prices and providing prompt, friendly customer service.

They are dedicated to Final Cut Pro X and its users. They are family owned and operated and consider themselves blessed to have the opportunity to do what they do.
