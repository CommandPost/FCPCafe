### Annotator

**Annotator** is a set of flexible animated tools to mark or highlight part of your video.

With Annotator, you can draw on a hand-made arrow to point at something, throw a dotted box around something else, or even zoom in to focus on a solid circle. Though fully customisable options are included, this is not just another callout pack — it includes unique, exclusive recordings of hand-drawn animated shapes for an organic feel. Every shape includes several different options so you can use a new variation every time. You’ll find these shapes perfect for educational or instructional videos, cooking videos, reviews, or any time you need your viewers to look at something specific.

First, you’ll pick a style that suits your project — synthetic generated options with full control over stroke with and other line properties, or organic hand-drawn options recorded from the movement of a real pen. Next, from your chosen style, you’ll pick a shape:

- Arrows to point at things.
- Circles, Ovals, Rectangles and Squares to draw attention to something.
- Lines to underline or highlight specific items and Zigzags to scribble items out. Zigzags are only available in the hand-made recorded styles.
- Checkmarks (aka “ticks”) and Crosses to mark things as good or bad.
- Zoom In, to magnify part of the image and optionally darken down everything else. Only available in the generated styles.

Every item here can be easily positioned, rotated and scaled using the on-screen controls. In the Inspector you can adjust many more properties about the shapes, like the color, the outline width, animation speed, and to change which organic recorded shape is shown. Dashed and Dotted styles include several relevant options so you can dial in the settings you want. Advanced controls let you add a drop shadow or a glow, or change the 3D rotation or anchor point.

All the shapes will work with any aspect ratio from vertical through ultra-wide.
