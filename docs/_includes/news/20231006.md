To quote the App Store:

> Create stunning AI text-to-image artwork from Markers in your Final Cut Pro Projects or Premiere Pro Sequences. Picture This… takes the text-to-image prompts from Markers in a Project or Sequence and generates image variations for each prompt, and returns these images to Final Cut Pro as a new Project with Auditions, or to higher tracks in a Premiere Pro Sequence, for easy comparison.
>
> Using the latest version of Stable Diffusion, Picture This… provides background batch processing of images and the convenience of Auditions in your Final Cut Pro Projects.
>
> **Convenient**
> Create your prompts where you will use them: in red Markers in your timeline.
>
> **Processes as a Batch in the Background**
> Batch processing allows to you use your time productively while Picture This… — your “art department” — does it’s AI magic.
> Important: Do not continue working on that timeline. Any work you do on your edit will not be included in the results returned from Picture This…
>
> **Aligned in your Edit**
> New images display right where you need them in your timeline.
>
> **Other Features**
> Use multiple passes to hone in on the image you need. Optionally, fine tune the prompt each time.
> Images are always free, whether you generate one or 1000.
> Processing happens on your local Mac, never in the cloud.
>
> Images cannot be copyright individually, but do not limit the copyright on the finished project.
>
> **How it Works**
> In Final Cut Pro enter your image description (text-to-image prompt) in a To-Do Marker where you want the image to start. Or in Premiere Pro, add a red Sequence Marker with a prompt. Images continue to the next Marker or to the end of the underlying clip.
> Export and Import XML, or drag a Project (FCP only) to Picture This….
> Choose your settings and click Start to generate images.
> After processing the Project is returned to Final Cut Pro with Auditions, and each Audition contains the alternative images for each prompt. Or the Sequence is ready to import to Premiere Pro, with the generated images stacked on Video Tracks above your existing edit. There will be on track for each alternate image generated from the prompts.
> You can modify prompts and send the Project/Sequence to Picture This… again.
>
> **Requirements:**
> An Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Sonoma
> At least 8GB of RAM, but 16GB or more is recommended
> English text-to-image prompts are currently supported
> It requires macOS Sonoma and an Apple Silicon Mac.

**Final Cut Pro 10.6.10** is out now, which includes the following fixes:

- Fixes an issue that could cause an FxPlug-based title that analyzed a clip to result in an incomplete analysis.
- Fixes an issue that could cause a Motion template with an applied Align To behavior to display an incorrect animation.

This fixes FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.

HUGE thank you to Apple to listening to companies like FxFactory and turning around a bug fix so quickly!
