We've added some information from the editor, and lots of Final Cut Pro screenshots to our [Turn of the Tide case study](https://fcp.cafe/casestudies/turnofthetide/). Enjoy!

It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.

Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.
