As usual Ripple Training is straight out of the gate with a great summary video, which you can watch on YouTube below:

The amazing Jenn Jager has also released a video:

Final Cut Pro for Mac has a database update (`1133` in `v11.0.1`, and now `1150` in `v11.1`) - which means existing Libraries will need to be updated. We recommend manually making backups of your Final Cut Pro Libraries before updating.

There was no update to FCPXML in this release - it's still on FCPXML `v1.13`.

Interestingly, new **Adjustment Clips** in FCPXML are just standard `video` items with a new special `effect` applied - so existing FCPXML-based tools should continue to work without any updates:

```xml

            </project>
        </event>
    </library>
</fcpxml>
```

Whilst this isn't a major update (compared to what Blackmagic will most likely announce next week before NAB), it does have a lot a very useful additions for professional editors.

**Adjustment Clips** is something the Final Cut Pro community has been asking for a very long time, so it's awesome to see that Apple's finally built this in.

Whilst we've always been able to build empty Motion Titles to basically act as adjustment layers (I personally always used [Alex4D's free adjustment layer](https://blog.alex4d.com/2012/03/19/adjustment-layer-fcpx-effect/)) - it became a bit annoying with collaboration, because different people would use different adjustment layer Motion Templates. I have about 10 different Adjustment Layers on my system for example.

As you'll see in the above videos, Adjustments Clips are also an improvement upon the legacy Adjustment Layers, because they can be applied from the Effects Browser, and they also support transitions.

The addition of the **Quantec QRS (Quantec Room Simulator)** is awesome too - although not really unexpected, given it was featured so heavily at last years FCP Creative Summit when talking about Logic Pro. I would GUESS that they originally wanted this in FCP 11, but ran out of time.

Renaming audio effects in the Inspector is another super useful quality of life improvement, that was basically low-hanging fruit for the FCP team. Interestingly, this just uses the `nameOverride` parameter in FCPXML, which already was in FCPXML v1.13 for audio effects.

Revealing the source of a multicam angle or synced clip in the Browser is also another great quality of life improvement for professional editors. Previously, editors would have to use CommandPost to achieve similar functionality.

**Moveable Markers** have also finally been officially enabled! This has been a secret/hidden feature in Final Cut Pro for years - it was [first discovered](http://alex4d.com/notes/item/fcpx-movable-markers) by Alex Goldner back in June 2014, and added to [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io/faq/#why-did-you-remove-moveable-markers).

**Image Playground** is a bit of unsurprisingly, but "meh" feature, however if you don't enable Apple Intelligence at the macOS level, you won't even see the option anyway (so your `Import` button will just open the Import window)!

There's also lots of documented (and some undocumented) bug fixes, which is always welcome. The improvements to FxPlug will hopefully mean third party plugins will become more stable and reliable.

We'll continue to explore and test it in more detail over the coming weeks.

In the meantime, here's the full release notes:
