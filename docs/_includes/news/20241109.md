Simply drag and drop your project/timeline into the Workflow Extension window above and press **Go**.

The first time you run it, you'll most likely need to download language files from Apple

Our initial tests show that it's not always perfect in every language:

It seems to default to English if it has trouble translating, which seems like a good workaround.

However, I tried the exact timeline again a few minutes later and got better results:

I think maybe the models hadn't completely downloaded in the background yet, so this is something to keep in mind.
