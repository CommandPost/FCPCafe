### [9th June 2023](/news/20230609)

We're currently in the process of completely rebuilding the [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) website to bring it more inline with this website, and all our other software packages.

This will allow us to add better documentation more quickly - especially developer documentation. We'll also release a new CommandPost update within the next few days, so stay tuned!

At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new **MediaExtension** Framework, which is **BIG NEWS** for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.

This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesnâ€™t natively support.

This means that for [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/), we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!

We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of [macOS Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/), so stay tuned!
