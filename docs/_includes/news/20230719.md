**Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** is out now with the following bug fixes:

- Addresses an issue where audio effects would not be reset during playback.
- Fixes an issue where an Audio Units effect could have incorrect values when importing using FCPXML.
- Improves waveform redrawing on expanded audio components when adjusting volume with the Touch Bar.
- Resolves an issue where the Voice Isolation Amount slider would snap to 0% when trying to set a value less than 7%.
- Improves reliability when retiming a clip with the Scene Removal Mask applied.
- Fixes an issue where the Control Range setting in the Color Adjustments effect would be incorrectly set to SDR when importing using FCPXML.

Interestingly, this update requires a database update, so there must be some bigger changes under the hood.
