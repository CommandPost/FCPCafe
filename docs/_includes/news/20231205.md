**X2Pro5** is out now on the Mac App Store at a discounted introductory rate!

**X2Pro** will remain on sale, as X2Pro5 only works on macOS Ventura & Sonoma.

It's been completely re-written and redesigned with the following new features:

- Native Apple silicon support
- Expanded roles
- Enhanced media management
- Simple workflow via redesigned UI

Marquis’ new X2Pro5 software has been designed to integrate Final Cut Pro projects into a professional audio workflow, enabling Avid Pro Tools to be used for audio finishing. It works by converting the exported Final Cut Pro XML into an AAF file, which Avid Pro Tools can then open as a session, delivering seamless integration between the two applications.

X2Pro5 is a complete rewrite of Marquis’ popular X2Pro Audio Convert software, bringing with it native Apple silicon support and a redesigned user interface.

X2Pro5 takes advantage of the innovative metadata-based organising features in Final Cut Pro X, with expanded role management allowing unlimited numbers of audio roles in Final Cut Pro X to be converted into Pro Tools tracks for further audio processing and finishing by the audio engineer.

X2Pro5 has a simple, straightforward interface and is easy to customise; for example, you can decide if you want to include disabled or inactive clips in the export, and you can choose the length of frame handles. The software provides a fully professional audio workflow for Final Cut Pro editors, enabling a very complex audio timeline to be sent to the Pro Tools audio engineer with ease.X2Pro5 faithfully translates your audio timeline along with L-cuts, J-cuts, transitions, levels, automatic gain and fade handles, as well as the incredibly powerful FCP X compound and multicam clips. Transitions are converted into linear cross fades. Audio media can be any QuickTime supported audio, non-PCM audio is converted to PCM at either 16 or 24 bit.

With immersive audio technology continuing to grow in popularity, X2Pro5 provides a quick way for FCP users to be able to deliver a project to an external Pro Tools audio editor, sharing the FCPXML file so they can mix – and deliver – multi-channel audio.

R3D media is supported.

We recommend rendering an off-line or proxy version of the flattened video and exporting that if a reference is needed within Pro Tools. Only audio media is translated by X2Pro5.

**System Requirements:**

- Final Cut Pro X, and FCPXML from v1.7
- macOS 13 Ventura and later. X2Pro5 is tested on the latest release macOS and the previous release.
- Pro Tools v7.0 or later for AAF import (not LE versions, v7 and v8 require Digitranslator for AAF import)
