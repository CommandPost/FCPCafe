**evrExpanse v5.6.2** is out now!

It contains the following changes:

- **NEW:** Canon XF Utility Integration
- Added integration with the Canon XF Utility application to enhance metadata workflows for Canon XF-AVC MXF media.
- Applicable to Canon EOS Cinema cameras prior to the C80 and C400 series, including: C300 / C500 / C200 / C700 / C70 / R5 C and others.
- Note: Canon C80 and C400 (2024) embed metadata directly in the MXF files. evrExpanse natively supports those without this integration.

- **ENHANCED:** Canon EOS Cinema Metadata Support
- Added support (via Canon XF Utility Integration) for extracting: ISO, FNumber, Shutter Speed, White Balance, and Focal Point (mm).
- Added direct support for extracting Camera Index, Reel Number, and Clip Number from Canon EOS Cinema MXF files improving shot-level identification and asset management.

- **ENHANCED:** Main Window Behavior Update
- The **Cancel** button in the main window has been relabeled as **Quit**.
- When clicked, the application now exits immediately instead of returning to the startup screen.
- On the next application launch, the startup screen now opens at its default size, rather than restoring the window size from the previous session.

- **FIXED:** Color Space Extraction for Canon C200 (XF-AVC)
- Resolved an issue where the Color Space could not be correctly extracted from XF-AVC MXF files recorded with the Canon C200 camera.
