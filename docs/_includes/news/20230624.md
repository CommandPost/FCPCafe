We've thrown together a simple Python script called **Rename Avid MXF Files**.

It's used to rename MXF files generated by Avid Media Composer to match the **Package Name** in their metadata.

The script can process a **single file** or a folder containing **multiple** MXF files.

This is useful if you want to move native Avid MXF files from Avid Media Composer to Final Cut Pro.
