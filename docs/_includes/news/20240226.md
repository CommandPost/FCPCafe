**Capacitor** allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.

For example, if you're working on **Final Cut Pro 10.7**, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML `v1.11` to `v1.9`.

Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from `v1.8` to `v1.10`.

If there are differences between FCPXML versions, Capacitor will offer a list of warnings that you can also export.

Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to "clean" FCPXMLs - for example, it corrects [this bug](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/314) in Final Cut Pro's output.

It support both `.fcpxml` files and FCPXML Bundles (`.fcpxmld`).

Capacitor was coded and created by [David Peterson](https://github.com/randomeizer).

The Capacitor icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com).

The Capacitor icon animation was animated by [Mike Greaney](http://www.mikegreaney.com).
