If you've been in the post production community for a minute, you've most certainly come across the name **Monica Daniel**.

She's been featured on the [BorisFX Artist Profile](https://blog.borisfx.com/ask-the-artist-monica-daniel-editor).

She's been on Zack Arnold's various [websites and podcasts for years](https://zackarnold.com/monica-daniel-podcast-interview/).

She's been [Sh*tting Sparkles](https://www.tumblr.com/monicaedits).

She has an insanely impressive list of [IMDB credits](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2758396/).

Whilst I don't believe we've ever met in person, I've probably listened to hundreds of hours of her talking over the years on various podcasts.

She now needs **our help**.

She writes on [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-a-mother-and-her-teens-in-crisis):

> This is very difficult for me to do. I pride myself on being self-sufficient and independent. I have been a professional editor with a successful career in film and television for 20 years. I am a single mother of two teenagers who do well in school and are loving young humans. My son is special needs, and that provides its own unique challenges as I try to be the best mother I can for them. I have given back to the post-production community through volunteering for non-profit organizations like Los Angeles Creative Pro User Group and Blue Collar Post Collective. I have moderated and been a speaker on panels, taught seminars, mentored many up-and-coming editors, and produced a filmmaking edu-tainment podcast for the filmmaking community.

> When the strikes hit a couple of years ago, I had just finished working on the finale of a television show. And I have not worked since then. I needed to continue to provide for my children while I tried to find work. I have drained my savings and have managed to extend it as long as I can by accumulating extremely high credit card debt. I have had to pay thousands for water damage to my home in that time and have delayed repairs in my home because I cannot afford it. There have been medical bills and car repairs. I've gone to food banks and ran out of food stamp benefits.

> I need help as I am trying to find sources of income and get back on my feet and figure out my career path. I am too young to retire and too old to be considered for many other types of jobs. Thank you for reading.

When you look at the people who have already donated, you know this is important - for example:

- Marianna Montague
- Michael Kammes
- Philip Hodgetts
- Trevor Horton
- Kes Akalaonu

These are industry heavyweights.

I know it's bloody hard to be a post production professional anywhere in the world today, but if you can spare some money and help out Monica, that would be amazing.

Thanks team! xx
