**Eric Lenz** has released a video on YouTube called **CUTTING EDGE, MOVING SLOW – The Final Cut Pro Conundrum | Documentary**.

The description reads:

> Everybody is switching to DaVinci Resolve, and a strange feeling is going through the Final Cut Pro Community. The lack of feature updates is the apparent cause – or is it? In this documentary, we will see that the underlying issue is something else entirely.

It contains all your favourite Final Cut Pro YouTuber's:
