**Greetings from Cupertino!**

After a very nice long plane flight from Melbourne, Australia I'm now in the USA ready to cover the **Final Cut Pro Creative Summit** this week!

I'll be post daily wrap-ups from the three day conference, and covering any Apple and third party announcements.

I'm fairly confident we'll see updates to Final Cut Pro for Mac, Compressor and Motion.

I'm very confident we'll see some cool stuff from third parties, based on the speaker list.

I have absolutely no idea what's coming for Final Cut Pro on iPad or if the Apple Vision Pro will make an appearance.

Apple has been promising third party Motion Templates for Final Cut Pro on the iPad since launch - the website still says "coming soon".

We know that with [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.fcp.cafe) you can bring Mac Motion Templates to iPad in MOST cases.

I wonder if we'll see Motion for iPad released, along with a whole heap of Motion Templates from [MotionVFX](https://www.motionvfx.com)?

I do know there's quite a few people from MotionVFX coming to the conference this year.

We also know that Spatial Video is coming to Final Cut Pro - does this mean we'll be able to hook up a Vision Pro to Final Cut Pro?

Only a few days to go, and all will be revealed!
