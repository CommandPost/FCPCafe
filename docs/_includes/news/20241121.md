### [21st November 2024](/news/20241121)

**CommandPost v1.5.0** is out now!

It includes the following changes:

**Improvements:**
- Updated to Lua v5.4.7.
- Added support for FCPXML v1.13 used by Final Cut Pro 11.
- Increased the number of banks from 30 to 50. Thanks for suggesting Todd Hallam!
- We now force the Sony Timecode Repair Toolbox to use FCPXML v1.11, so that it can be more easily imported into older versions of DaVinci Resolve.

**Bug Fixes:**
- Added support for Clear Key in Final Cut Pro Command Sets. Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!
- Fixed an error on macOS Sequoia, where macOS would return no frontmost windows (which shouldn't technically be possible). Thanks for reporting Iain Anderson!
- Fixed a bug where **Insert Action** in the Scripting panel would fail to import some actions. Thanks for reporting Ermal Rexhepi!
- Fixed a bug in Final Cut Pro 11 and macOS Sequoia where CommandPost could fail to apply Effects, Transitions, Titles and Generators. Thanks for reporting Kurt Farr!
- We now correctly trigger **Final Cut Pro Trial** menubar items when running the trial version of Final Cut Pro.
