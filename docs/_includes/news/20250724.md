**FidelityFuze `v1.2.0`** is now available. The update adds integrated noise reduction and a revamped detail recovery engine to the upscaler for Final Cut Pro, which runs natively inside the timeline. Designed for Apple Silicon, FidelityFuze processes upscaling and cleanup tasks in real time within the editor.

There’s also a new comparison video showing upscaling from WQHD to 4K using the new feature set:
