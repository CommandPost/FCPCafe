### 28th May 2023

We've recently reported two annoying **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 bugs** to be across:

- [FCPXML v1.11 doesn't support Soundtracks (May 28, 2023)](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/94){target="_blank"}
- [Audio Presets don't migrate from earlier versions to v10.6.6 (May 27, 2023)](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/92){target="_blank"}

We've reported them to Apple, and will keep track of them in our [Bug Tracker](/bugtracker/).
