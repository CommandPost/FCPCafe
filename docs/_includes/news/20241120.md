In very sad news, the post production community recently found out via Rohanâ€™s brother in-law that Motion guru **Rohan Marks** has unexpectedly past away.

Whilst I knew of Rohan and his amazing work in the Motion and Final Cut Pro community, I didn't know him personally, however **Bret Williams** of [BretFX](https://www.bretfx.com) has shared these thoughts:

> ðŸ˜¢ It is with great sadness that I share with the group that our resident Motion guru Rohan Marks passed away last week. According to his sister he was "lost suddenly and too soon." Rohan was an amazing soul and a mentor to us all here. Rohan was one of the nicest guys I've ever known.  We had become good friends over the last few years, chatting frequently about Motion and life in general.<br />
> Spreading the word about Motion, and helping people learn Motion was one of his passions. He even recently went so far as to say to me that "Motion literally changed my life. For the best." He was proud of the work he did as one of Stupid Raisins creatives and more recently you could find his own solutions on FxFactory as "ROWIE" and his tutorials on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rowie409).<br />
> Please keep Rohan's family and friends in your thoughts and prayers. Rest in peace Rohan. You will be sorely missed. ðŸ’”

From all reports, he was a very loving, helpful, and talented person - and will be very much missed by everyone in the Motion and Final Cut Pro community.

**BRAW Toolbox v1.4.1 (71)** is out now.

It includes the following improvements:

- Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v4.3 to v4.3.1.
- Updated from FxPlug v4.3 to v4.3.1.
- Improved Blackmagic RAW SDK stability with simultaneous decodes.

Whilst Apple did announce at the 2024 Final Cut Pro Creative Summit that **Final Cut Pro 11** now supports the new macOS system-wide [MediaExtension Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaextension), and that Blackmagic will at some point release a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension - there is currently no time frame, so we have no idea if this is coming in days, weeks, or months.

In [2023](https://x.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1667015417175625734) Apple announced a new framework called **MediaExtension**, that provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesnâ€™t natively support - such as **Blackmagic RAW** and **Nikon NRAW**.

This was supposed to come in **macOS Sonoma**, but they silently killed it - only for it to reappear in this years WWDC for **macOS Sequoia**.

Whilst it's been out for a while, the documentation is insanely complicated and limited and the only person I know who's done ANYTHING with it so far is the incredible [Anton Marini](https://x.com/_vade), who's been building an **ffmpeg** Media Extension over on GitHub [here](https://github.com/vade/FFMPEGMediaExtension).

I originally started playing with and testing MediaExtension's both back in 2023, and during the macOS Sequoia beta's, but never made much progress, as Final Cut Pro 10.8.1 didn't support Media Extensions anyway.

However, given there's no certainty as to when Blackmagic will release a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension, we're going to go back and see if we can bring a Blackmagic RAW Media Extension to market sooner rather than later.

Apple announced 3rd party Motion Templates were "coming soon" to iPad at launch, and that functionality is still not out - so we don't really want to waste time waiting for something that could be a year away.

We'll continue to keep you posted on our progress on FCP Cafe.
