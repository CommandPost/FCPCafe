There's a new app on the Mac App Store! Introducing **Lumberjack System Builder NLE**!

On the anniversary of the release of Appleâ€™s Final Cut Pro X, [Lumberjack System](https://lumberjacksystem.com) has released their Text Based Editing app as a **one-off purchase** in the Mac App Store.

The original and most complete Text Based Editing solution for Final Cut Pro has long been available as part of the Lumberjack System Membership. This version makes Builder NLE more easily found, and more accessible to Final Cut Pro users who want a complete Text Based Editing environment for Final Cut Pro.

Builder NLE in the Mac App Store is the same app that is available through the membership, but without access to the wider Lumberjack live logging tools. It continues to include unlimited free transcription in 16 languages, closed caption support on Stories, unlimited stories, a comprehensive Keyword Manager, and extremely powerful search and filter tools to get you to your stories faster.

**BRAW Toolbox v1.2.1 (53)** is out now, with a minor bug fix:

- The Workflow Extension now gracefully aborts (instead of crashing), and shows an error message if a BRAW clip is corrupt, and the metadata can't be read. Thanks for reporting Dominik Radecki!
