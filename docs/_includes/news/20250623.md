Earlier this week **Final Cut Pro** turned 14! ðŸ¥³

I'll let Mr Richard Taylor do the honours...

Also, in very positive news, [Mashable reports](https://mashable.com/article/vidcon-2025-tech-products-we-loved) from **VidCon 2025**:

> **The editing software of choice? Final Cut Pro**
>
> TikTokkers can keep CapCut. At VidCon 2025, it's all about Final Cut Pro. For Apple users who shoot and edit their own content, this Mac video editing software is indispensable. So far, it's the single most-recommended product we've encountered in conversations with creators. A subscription will set you back $299.99, but there is a free trial to test it out.

That's awesome news, and to be honest, very surprising given all the help, support and sponsorship Adobe gives VidCon!

**FidelityFuze** has been announced over at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/finalcutpro/comments/1lfin6y/built_a_native_final_cut_pro_plugin_for_realtime/), in a post titled **Built a native Final Cut Pro plugin for real-time upscaling â€“ 1080p, 4K, even 8K directly in the timeline**.

The developer **Sebastian Krogull** has already had HUGE interest in the product, which is currently at release candidate stage, in final beta testing.

I've had a chance to download and play - and it's very impressive.

Sebastian will post a developers case study over at FCP Cafe after launch!

Noting that Sebastian says:

> Note: These are preview versions of the final website. FidelityFuze hasnâ€™t launched yet â€“ itâ€™s still in early access. Iâ€™m building it solo and working to make sure everything is solid. DM me or reply here if youâ€™d like to try it â€“ or just share your thoughts.

We'll post more in the coming weeks!
