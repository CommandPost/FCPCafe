FCP Cafe now has a new logo/icon designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](https://matthewskiles.com). We hope you like it as much as we do!

He has also designed a new logo/icon for [Resolve Cafe](https://resolve.cafe), which is equally amazing.

We've just added an amazingly detailed [case study for **Blood & Gold**](/case-studies/blood-and-gold/)!

**BRAW Toolbox** v1.1.4 (51) is [now available](https://brawtoolbox.io) on the Mac App Store.

Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.

Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.

As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made **Create Multicam Clips** the default option as a workaround to this issue.

We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a **Custom** Solids Generator.

Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.

Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.

We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.

To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a **Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)** Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.

HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.

We'll leave **Create Multicam Clips** on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.
