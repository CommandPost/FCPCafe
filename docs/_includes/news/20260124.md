### [24th January 2026](/news/20260124)

In interesting news, Apple is hosting a three-day Creator Studio event next week.

Selected YouTubers and other creators have been invited to an exclusive Apple Experience in Los Angeles for the launch of Apple Creator Studio.

It's entirely possible that Apple might release new hardware next week too.

[Petr Mára](https://www.instagram.com/petrmara/) shared on Instagram [an invitation he received for the event:

Interestingly, it seems that only Petr has posted this invite publicly - possibly breaking an Apple NDA, or at the very least an unspoken rule amongst Apple invitees.

The invitation doesn't really have much information, but it does have an Apple logo that's been stylised in the same style as the Apple Creator Studio apps.

The event has an unspecified location in Los Angeles and runs from 27th to 29th of January - so it's also right in the middle of the launch date for Apple Creator Studio.

Maybe we'll see three days of Apple product announcements?

Given Final Cut Pro 12 now has machine learning powered speech and visual search, that is on by default - it makes sense for Apple to use this as a selling point for new hardware - really pushing the power of on-device machine learning processing.

The [rumour mill](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/14/what-to-expect-from-the-m5-macbook-pro) has suggested that Apple is expected to launch a new MacBook Pro with the M5 Pro and M5 Max processors early in 2026 - so maybe we'll see that next week.

Either way, next week will be exciting, and probably very busy for developers building for Final Cut Pro!

I hope to have a new version of CommandPost and Transfer Toolbox out ASAP once Apple Creator Studio ships.
