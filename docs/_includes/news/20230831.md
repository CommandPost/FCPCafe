**Luke Nash** is an up-and-coming Final Cut Pro & Motion Developer who's currently working on some awesome new tools to help with building complex user interfaces in [Apple Motion](https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/motion/) easier, faster and more powerful.

His latest project, **OSCar Rectangle**, is an [FxPlug4](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/fxplug?language=objc) plugin that works in Apple Motion to provide a powerful rectangular on-screen control that can be used and combined with other Apple Motion effects. For example, if you wanted to build a colour correction tool with powerful masking features, you could use **OSCar Rectangle** to allow your users to draw masks via an on-screen tool in the Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro Viewer.

Whilst **OSCar Rectangle** has been written in Objective-C using the FxPlug4 API (Apple Motion's Effects API for third party developers) - it's easily accessible within Apple's Motion, just like regular built-in tools, so anyone who's making Motion Templates in Apple Motion can make use of this functionality without knowing any code. Essentially these are tools to make it easier for people to make awesome Motion Templates, which can then be "exposed" in Final Cut Pro.

Luke is currently demonstrating **OSCar Rectangle** via a series of YouTube videos, with the intention of trying to raise funds to cover a new Mac and Apple Developer Account via [this Indiegogo campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1). If he can raise the necessary funds to finish **OSCar Rectangle**, he will release the software for free, and potentially even open-source.

There are very few FxPlug4 developers in the world, especially in terms of solo indie developers - so it's awesome to see Luke really tackling uncharted territory. These tools could potentially be game-changers to the growing list of Final Cut Pro YouTuber's that are also building their own Motion Templates to sell.

**OSCar Rectangle** is still very much a work-in-progress, with a beta build hopefully coming in the coming weeks.
