**New Features:**
- Added the ability to export **Avid Media Composer Marker Text** files. Thanks for suggesting Scott Simmons!
- Added support for importing the **Timecode+ TSV** format. Thanks for suggesting pulpjedi!

**Improvements**:
- Various improvements to the user interface. Marker Toolbox now looks a lot nicer!
- We moved the OpenAI API key into the Settings panel, and added a "Validate" button so that you can check that the API key is valid.
- All settings are now saved between the main application and the Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, meaning that if you change a setting in the Workflow Extension, it will also change in the main application and vice versa.
