**Metaburner** is now available on the Mac App Store at a discount rate (for a limited time)! ðŸ¥³

Previously it was only available on [FxFactory](https://fxfactory.com/install/metaburner) - however, there were a few users (**cough**, Vigneswaran Rajkumar), that really wanted it on the Mac App Store too, so we've finally put it there too!

The versions should be mostly identical (although the Mac App Store version is sandboxed) - and we'll try keep them in-sync.

**You can buy it today for USD$79.99 (previously USD$149 on FxFactory).**

Metaburner is an Advanced Metadata Generator for Final Cut Pro.

You can access it via a **Title** in the Titles sidebar.

Metaburner gives you **25 text layers** that you can populate with whatever metadata you want.

You can even stack multiple Metaburner Titles on top of each other for **unlimited** metadata fields!

To begin, simply drag your Final Cut Pro Project from the Browser into the Metaburner Title Inspector via a drop zone, and then Metaburner has full access to everything that's in the FCPXML.

There's also a **Lua scripting environment** built-in, so you can even "code" your own text for unlimited possibilities.

You can even share Lua variables between multiple Metaburner titles for some crazy cool workflows!

The charming **Shamir Allibhai** from [Eddie AI](https://heyeddie.ai) has released an awesome little blog post.

He explains:

> I remember April 2011. It was when Apple launched Final Cut Pro X and ended FCP 7. FCP Xâ€™s magnetic timeline looked amazing but too much of radical departure for me back then. It was too hard to use after having learned and depended on FCP 7. I migrated to Adobe Premiere.

> The launch didnâ€™t just divide the editing world â€” it shattered it.<br />
> Editors walked out. Forums caught fire. Careers shifted overnight.

> But what if we got the story wrong?
>
> What if that launch wasnâ€™t a failureâ€¦ but a fault line?<br />
> One that quietly reshaped the next decade of content creation?

> We wrote about this pivotal moment in our latest long form article...
