**Gyroflow Toolbox v1.1.1** is out now!

This release includes two bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue where the Gyroflow Toolbox output could be incorrectly clipped when in a HDR project. Thanks for reporting Tumist! Thanks to AdrianEddy for fixing the issue in Gyroflow Core!
- Fixed an issue where a Gyroflow Project could fail to reload correctly after restarting Final Cut Pro due to FxPlug4 incorrectly HTML decoding the string value. We solve this by now base64 encoding the Gyroflow Project in FxPlug4.

Thanks to everyone who has purchased, downloaded and tested the latest Gyroflow Toolbox updates! The response has been awesome!
