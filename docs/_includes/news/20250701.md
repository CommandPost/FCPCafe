**Pinch and a punch for the first day of the month!**

Ok, so this is pushing the boundaries of a Final Cut Pro related post, HOWEVER I did edit it in Final Cut Pro, so... there's that...

Regardless... **Jumper for Avid Media Composer** now has Group Clip support (i.e. Multicam support). ðŸ¥³

Whilst **Jumper for Final Cut Pro** and **Jumper for Adobe Premiere Pro** has supported Multicam Clips (and Synchronised Clips in the case of Final Cut Pro) for a while, on Avid it's a bit more tricky.

However, now, as long as you have matching timecode ranges, Group clips now work in Avid too!

You can watch a quick and dirty realtime demonstration of the functionality here:

For those that don't know Krock.io is basically [very similar to Frame.io](https://krock.io/blog/frame-io-alternative-2025/).
