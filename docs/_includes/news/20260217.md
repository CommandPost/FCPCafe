### [17th February 2026](/news/20260217)

Happy Tuesday!

Unrelated... I saw [There's Still Tomorrow (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21800162/) in the cinema last night - and it was AMAZING. HIGHLY recommended.

You can watch the trailer on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNREdtrrQyk).

We've got some exciting updates this week! Our latest app [ScriptStar](https://scriptstar.fcp.cafe) is now up for [pre-sale on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/scriptstar/id6759045715) and goes live on Friday! We'll share more later this week!

Also, **VFX Toolbox** and **Notion Toolbox** will be making their way to the Mac App Store VERY soon.

**LogicSplitter** will be making it's way to FxFactory VERY soon as well!

Exciting times!

Onwards & Upwards!

Apple have announced a "Special Apple Experience" (as opposed to an "event") in **New York**, **London**, and **Shanghai**, taking place on **4th March 2026 at 9:00am ET**.

This is most likely similar to the "experience" Apple gave a bunch of influencers in LA for the launch of Apple Creator Studio.

Only select members from the media in the three major cities are invited.

So far, there's been no information or leaks as to what they might be slowing, and the Apple logo doesn't really give much away.

The rumour mill predicts that several new Apple products will be released soon including:

- [2025 iPad Air with 11-inch and 13-inch display options, M3 chip, Touch ID power button, and optional 5G connectivity](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/)
- Apple TV
- HomePod Mini
- iPhone 17e
- MacBook Pro M5 Max
- MacBook Pro M5 Pro
- MacBook with A18 chip
- Studio Display

For Final Cut Pro users, new MacBook Pro's would certainly be welcome and exciting!
