**Gyroflow Toolbox v1.3.1 (Build 23)** is out now! ðŸ¥³

This includes the following improvements:

- We've updated to the [latest](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/tree/83356d01207b78dc6755740eaebbe93b3c3ec62d) Gyroflow Core Renderer. HUGE thank you to the amazing [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all his ongoing help, assistance, genius and support!
- Updated from FxPlug `v4.3.2` to `v4.3.3`.
- 175 lens profiles have been updated from the hero Gyroflow project. Thanks to EVERYONE who has submitted lens profiles and another HUGE thank you to [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy) for all the work that goes into managing them.

There is still an [outstanding bug/regression](https://github.com/latenitefilms/gyroflowtoolbox/issues/40) related to **vertical videos**.

Originally, vertical videos worked great in Gyroflow Toolbox, but at some point changes in Gyroflow broke something, and we haven't been able to work out what.

I think, thanks to the amazing [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy), we now have a possible solution - we'll try and solve this and get out a new bug fix ASAP.

You can learn more about Gyroflow Toolbox on the [Gyroflow Toolbox website](https://gyroflowtoolbox.fcp.cafe).

I'm also busily working away on my next app for the Mac App Store, **SplitTake**.

SplitTake is a Swift/Swift UI application for capturing your screen, webcam and external microphone to ProRes for editing in Final Cut Pro.

There's a lot of great screen recording apps out there, but a lot of them (like ScreenFlow) expect you to do all the editing WITHIN their app - I just want something that easily records the highest quality possible, then gives me everything in Final Cut Pro.

I'm still trying to get the under-the-hood stuff working well first, before tackling the user interface, but here's a sneak peak:

I'll hopefully get it up on TestFlight next week. Stay tuned!
