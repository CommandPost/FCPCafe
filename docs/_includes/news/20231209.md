### [9th December 2023](/news/20231209)

Chris Hocking at [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com) has started developing his next product, **Metaburner Pro**.

Metaburner Pro is a Motion Generator that accepts a FCPXML, and "writes" the FCPXML metadata over the top of your Final Cut Pro timeline.

Think of it as basically the same as the **Data Burn-In** tool in DaVinci Resolve.

It's incredibly early days - however we hope to have a **early alpha** on TestFlight in the coming weeks.

We are working closely with the professional Final Cut Pro Community, to make sure it's useful for high-end productions - especially long-form projects with big VFX deliverables.

It will be released on the Mac App Store for **USD$100**.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to post them in the [GitHub Issues for Metaburner Pro](https://github.com/latenitefilms/MetaburnerPro/issues).

Here's a sneak peak of the early development (with a placeholder icon):

Thanks to everyone who's already offered ideas and suggestions!

Onwards & Upwards!
