### [20th July 2023](/news/20230720)

I've been cutting all day with **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7**.

This is a fresh job (i.e. not something migrated from 10.6.6), and it has a LOT of third-party Motion Templates, effects, random still images, random videos in a variety of formats, etc.

Unfortunately, whilst I was able to successfully edit, and export without too many dramas, 10.6.7 definitely seems more buggy and unreliable than 10.6.6.

I had to manually quit and restart Final Cut Pro quite a few times throughout the day because the Viewer was just black. Nothing I could do would bring it back to life, apart from a restart.

This is consistent with other professional long-form editors I've chatted to.

After one of the restarts, after applying an cut to an audio clip, and adding a transition, suddenly the Viewer went "strobing" - again, requiring another manual restart.

I haven't had any crashes, but it's definitely got... issues.

One major [confirmed bug](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/217){target="_blank"} is that Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 doesn't properly respect 0% opacity in Motion Templates. For example, if you apply the `Placeholder` Generator, it will ALWAYS show the notes:

This could be a deal breaker if you're using a Motion Template that uses this technique to hide things. Luckily none of the Motion Templates I used today had any issues.

It's also worth nothing that **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)** uses a newer Library format than **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.

This means that if you want to use [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.io){target="_blank"} to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)**.

My suggestion would be to stick with Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 for now, and wait for another bug fix in a few weeks time.
