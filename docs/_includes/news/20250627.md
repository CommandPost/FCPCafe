But, I purchased the full version of the software a long time ago. And, to Apple's credit, every single time I go to the App Store on any mac I still have access to download it. I must have been through 20, 30? I don't know but a lot of macs over the years. Just recently I downloaded it again and notice the XML Export feature.

I spend most of my time just telling Claude Code the video I want to create, and he uses the cutlass library to achieve it. I'm hooking up FCP directly to Claude. A different kind of AI Video generation!
