**Fast Collections** is a **Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension** that allows you to quickly create a **Smart Collection** from a list of **Keywords**.

When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as **feature-length documentaries** with **hundreds of clips** and **thousands of keywords**, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.

This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new **Smart Collection**, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.

This was originally intended to be a very niche application, primarily used by long-form documentary editors.

However, as requested by Vigneswaran Rajkumar, we've added the ability to **Generate** a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc.

This is very handy for long-form projects, so to make the application more accessible, we're also reduced the price to a one-time payment of **USD$9.99** on the **Mac App Store**.
