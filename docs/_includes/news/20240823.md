Apple has released two new videos about Final Cut Pro for Mac and Final Cut Pro for iPad on their official YouTube Channel.

Unconfirmed, but I'm fairly confident these were the videos that Apple opened with when we visited Apple Park last year for the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit.

You can watch here:

Either way, it's great to see the wider Apple finally promoting Final Cut Pro to the world!
