**CommandPost v2.0.4** is out now!

![](/static/commandpost-2-0-4.png)

It includes the following changes:

**🔨 Improvements**
- **Scan Running Application Menubars on Startup** and **Scan the Menubars of the Active Application** are now enabled by default on a fresh install, to avoid confusion for new users. These were originally disabled by default to make a fresh install of CommandPost launch as quickly as possible - however it confuses too many new users.

**🐞 Bug Fix**
- Fixed all actions that used the **Reveal in Browser** menubar item, including the **Reveal in Browser and Highlight** action in Final Cut Pro v11.1. This menubar item has been renamed in to **Reveal Source in Browser** in Final Cut Pro v11.1. Thanks for reporting Johnny!

You can download and learn more on the [CommandPost website](https://commandpost.fcp.cafe).

**Pipeline Neo v2.0.1** is out now!

It includes the following improvements:

- Logging: seven levels (trace–critical), optional file + console, quiet mode; `--log` records user-visible output for all CLI commands
- CLI: `--log`, `--log-level`, `--quiet`; `--extension-type` for convert (fcpxmld | fcpxml; default fcpxmld; 1.5–1.9 always .fcpxml); `--extract-media` → `--media-copy` under EXTRACTION; `--validate` (semantic + DTD; progress when not quiet); single binary with embedded DTDs, no bundle
- Progress bar (TQDM-style) for `--media-copy` and `--validate`
- Semantic validation: refs resolved against all element IDs (e.g. text-style-def in titles), not only top-level resources
- Library: `FCPXMLVersion.supportsBundleFormat` (1.10+ for .fcpxmld; 1.5–1.9 .fcpxml only)
- Scripts: `generate_embedded_dtds.sh` / `swift run GenerateEmbeddedDTDs` regenerate EmbeddedDTDs.swift (version order 1.5→1.14); Scripts/README; Xcode Build post-actions remove generator binary after build
- Service logs parse, convert, save, DTD validate, media extract/copy
- Test suite: 181 tests
- Documentation updated (README, Manual, CLI README, Documentation/, Scripts, .cursorrules, AGENT.md)
