# 🆕 evrExpanse 5.6.3 & 5.6.4 Bring Accurate Camera Capture Time to FCP Workflows

The latest updates to **evrExpanse**, versions **5.6.3** and **5.6.4**, deliver a major improvement for editors who rely on accurate timestamp metadata — especially when working in **Final Cut Pro**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and other NLEs or metadata tools.

---

## 📸 Camera-Embedded `CreateDate` Support

`CreateDate` is the actual moment the camera records each clip — embedded directly in the file’s metadata. Until now, many workflows relied on the **filesystem creation date**, which can become inaccurate after file transfers or cloud uploads/downloads.

With **evrExpanse 5.6.3**, this camera-authored `CreateDate` is now embedded in **DaVinci Resolve CSV exports**, joining the existing support for Final Cut Pro and other supported NLEs. The **“Content Created”** field in metadata now reflects the true capture time, enabling better organization, filtering, and Smart Collection creation — even after transfers or rewraps.

## 🧠 Accurate Timestamps in Transcoded Files

Version **5.6.4** takes it even further. When the **“Include Source Metadata”** option is enabled, evrExpanse sets the **transcoded file’s creation date** to match the original `CreateDate` from the camera — not the OS-generated date.

The result? When transcoded media is imported into **Final Cut Pro**, **DaVinci Resolve**, or other NLEs, the **“Content Created”** field shown in the browser reflects the true capture time — not a timestamp corrupted by transfer or OS-level changes.

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

- True **Content Created** timestamps preserved in transcoded files  
- Improved accuracy for **Smart Collections** and media organization workflows  
- Full compatibility with **FCP**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and metadata tools like **FoolCat**  
- Smart fallback to filesystem creation date when metadata is unavailable
