**ATEM Exporter v1.0.1** is out now on the Mac App Store! ü•≥

**ATEM Exporter** is a native Swift + Swift UI Mac Application that listens to a [Blackmagic ATEM switcher](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atem), and logs all the camera changes.

You can export the camera changes as a Final Cut Pro `FCPXML`, to use in Final Cut Pro or Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve.

You can export a **Program Cut**, which allows you to use your program feed from an external recorder (such as a [Blackmagic HyperDeck](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/hyperdeck)), and add cut points each time there's a camera change.

You can also export a **Multicam**, which allows you to use your program feed as well as any ISO (i.e. independent camera) recordings, and export a Multicam clip for Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve.

ATEM Exporter was built in a few hours during a live event, and has **only** currently been tested in a real-world live production using an **Blackmagic ATEM Constellation 8K**, Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs - so we welcome any user feedback for other ATEM's!

We're currently just using a placeholder icon (from [Timecode Toolbox](https://fcp.cafe/latenite/#timecode-toolbox)) whilst a new one is being designed - stay tuned!

You can learn more on the [ATEM Exporter website](https://atemexporter.fcp.cafe).

**evrExpanse 5.6.3 & 5.6.4** Bring Accurate Camera Capture Time to FCP Workflows

The latest updates to **evrExpanse**, versions **5.6.3** and **5.6.4**, deliver a major improvement for editors who rely on accurate timestamp metadata ‚Äî especially when working in **Final Cut Pro**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and other NLEs or metadata tools.

üì∏ **Camera-Embedded `CreateDate` Support**

`CreateDate` is the actual moment the camera records each clip ‚Äî embedded directly in the file‚Äôs metadata. Until now, many workflows relied on the **filesystem creation date**, which can become inaccurate after file transfers or cloud uploads/downloads.

With **evrExpanse 5.6.3**, this camera-authored `CreateDate` is now embedded in **DaVinci Resolve metadata export**, joining the existing support for Final Cut Pro and other supported NLEs. The **‚ÄúContent Created‚Äù** field in metadata now reflects the true capture time, enabling better organization, filtering, and Smart Collection creation ‚Äî even after transfers or rewraps.

üïû **Accurate Timestamps in Transcoded Files**

Version **5.6.4** takes it even further. When the **‚ÄúInclude Source Metadata‚Äù** option is enabled, evrExpanse sets the **transcoded file‚Äôs creation date** to match the original `CreateDate` from the camera ‚Äî not the OS-generated date.

The result? When transcoded media is imported into **Final Cut Pro**, **DaVinci Resolve**, or other NLEs, the **‚ÄúContent Created‚Äù** field shown in the browser reflects the true capture time ‚Äî not a timestamp corrupted by transfer or OS-level changes.

‚úÖ **Key Benefits**

- True **Content Created** timestamps preserved in transcoded files
- Improved accuracy for **Smart Collections** and media organization workflows
- Full compatibility with **FCP**, **DaVinci Resolve**, and metadata tools like **FoolCat**
- Smart fallback to filesystem creation date when metadata is unavailable

These updates are available now in **evrExpanse 5.6.4**.
