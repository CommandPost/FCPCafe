**Dylan Bates** (The Final Cut Bro) has released an update to his **Pro Zooms** plugin.

He explains:

> I have added a zoom offset slider, which will now let you adjust the size of the zoom, without using the on screen controls. This is definitely a hacked together solution, but I was getting tired of waiting for an update from Apple to completely resolve this issue.
>
> Just know, if you use the zoom offset slider, the on screen controls will no longer accurately show exactly what you will be zooming into.
>
> If you were having no issues with Pro Zooms in the past, there is no need to update. This is only to help the few that can't seem to adjust the controls for whatever reason.
