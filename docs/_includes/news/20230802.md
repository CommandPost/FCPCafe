**Final Cut Pro 10.6.8** is now available on the Mac App Store!

The release notes only have one line:

> Fixes an issue where video could freeze in the viewer.

However, based on early reports, this release seems to fix the various crashes that users were reporting too, in addition to the Viewer sometimes going black or strobing.

If you're currently using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier** we recommend sticking with that for the time being.

However, if you're using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** we recommend updating.

Please make sure you make a backup of your Final Cut Pro application by creating a `ZIP` file of it, before updating. You should also manually backup any libraries before updating.
