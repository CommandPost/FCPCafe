**FinalCap Ultimate** is out now on the Mac App Store.

The developer writes:

> Hi FCP Cafe! I want to share FinalCap Ultimate, an extremely flexible captioning workflow extension/plugin built for Final Cut Pro!\
> It runs 100% offline and gives you full control over how subtitles are split, styled, and formatted. You can choose between fixed word counts or natural speech segments, and with options like breaking at punctuation or merging short subtitles (three words or fewer), you can quite literally shape any subtitle flow you want. You can also set custom character limits for line wrapping, translate subtitles to English, and even filter profanity automatically!\
> It is available on the App Store right now!
