**FidelityFuze 1.4.0** quietly shipped earlier this month.  
It is a smaller update focused on making the first run smoother for new users and trial testers.

**Quick Setup Check**

Opening the app for the first time now shows a **welcome and setup screen**. It provides a short overview of the plugin and guides you through the **initial project configuration**.  

The goal is to help new users avoid common early mistakes such as incorrect clip setup or confusion about **compound** and **adjustment layers**.
