First up, thanks to the **1901 people** who have already downloaded **CommandPost v1.6.0**!

For those considering using the [Final Cut Pro X Workspace Remapper](https://www.fcpxbooster.com/workspace-remapper/), we've seen the following comments from social media in terms of Final Cut Pro's stability:

Dylan Bates (The Final Cut Bro) [writes](https://x.com/thefinalcutbro/status/2012920333926314183):

> I’ve had zero issues when doing just a typical vertical layout. But stuff definitely can get funky with multiple browsers. Mostly visual artifacts for me like text being in the wrong spot.

Richard Taylor [writes](https://x.com/RichardTaylorTV/status/2012895720647295001):

> I've had problems.\
> 1) Browser clips sometimes don't live scrub.\
> 2) Viewer doesn't update when trimming between two clips.\
> \
> I stopped using custom layouts as I need these features to work.

Achu P. Chandra [writes](https://x.com/apcdgworks/status/2012922611051978810):

> It was a great option to customise the window layout. I created a layout for vertical video editing and a custom window layout. I also found bugs in the inactive audio meter and resizing of windows.

Sandeep Saini [writes](https://x.com/journeyvialens/status/2012985157150499188):

> I’ve been using them and loving them. The only issue have some sometimes that some of the audio scopes don’t show anything they just stationary.

> No issue so far
