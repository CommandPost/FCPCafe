**Automatic Duck** is testing their first workflow extension for Final Cut Pro, **Music Reporter**.

This simple workflow extension solves a problem the developers have every time they make a video for YouTube, collecting the names of all the music tracks they used so they can put them in the credits and in the description.

Drag your project onto the Music Reporter window and the Workflow Extension will list all of the clip names of the clips who were set to the Music role.
