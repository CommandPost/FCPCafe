**Capacitor** is now available on Apple's TestFlight for beta testing!

It allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.

For example, if you're working on **Final Cut Pro 10.7**, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML `v1.11` to `v1.9`.

Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from `v1.8` to `v1.10`.

Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to "clean" FCPXMLs.
