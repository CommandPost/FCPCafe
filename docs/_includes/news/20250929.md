**evrExpanse `v6.2.0`** Expands Metadata-to-Finder Tag Workflows  

The metadata-focused workflow app **evrExpanse** just got even better! With **version 6.2.0**, Finder Tags go far beyond simple labels â€” transforming macOS Finder into a true Media Asset Manager (MAM) and a powerful metadata bridge between **DaVinci Resolve** and **Final Cut Pro**.

This update brings a whole new level of flexibility: more fields, smarter options, and a cleaner interface that makes it a joy to keep your media perfectly organized.

**Whatâ€™s Fresh in 6.2 ðŸš€**
- **More Metadata from Resolve** â€” Go way beyond `Keywords`: now tag with `Description`, `Comments`, `People`, `Scene`, `Shot`, `Take`, `Good Take`, `Camera #`, `Reel Number`, `Roll Card #`, `Camera Type`, `Lens Type`, and `Location`.  
- **Notes from Final Cut Pro** â€” FCP Library and Event exports (`.fcpxml / .fcpxmld`) now bring across both `Keywords` *and* `Notes`.
- **Pick Your Fields** â€” The brand-new **Apply Finder Tags Options** panel lets you choose exactly which fields should become Finder Tags.
- **Metadata Exchange Made Easy** â€” Export from Resolve, tag in Finder, and re-import into Final Cut Pro as `Keywords` â€” smooth and consistent.  
- **Cleaner Process Options** â€” A redesigned layout makes choosing the right operation quicker and easier.
