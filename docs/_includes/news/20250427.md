**CommandPost is now on Discord!**

You can sign up for our new CommandPost Discord community on [Discord](https://ltnt.tv/discord).

I haven't had Facebook on my phone for years, and at the start of the year I removed Twitter as well.

Sadly, as a result, I was very slow to respond to Twitter DM's and questions on our [CommandPost Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/).

I'm an active member of a few Discord Communities, so I figured, I might as well try move the CommandPost community to Discord! We'll see how it goes.

Hope to see you there!

A standalone/desktop version of Jumper is also in active development.

You can learn more on the [Jumper website](https://getjumper.io).
