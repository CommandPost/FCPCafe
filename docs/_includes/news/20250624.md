**evrExpanse v6** is out! ðŸš€

Weâ€™re excited to introduce **ðŸ“Œ Apply Finder Tag**â€”a powerful new feature in v6 that allows you to apply Finder Tags to your files using metadata.

The Apply Finder Tags feature in evrExpanse lets you quickly batch-apply Finder tagsâ€”including both color tags and custom tags (labels)â€”to your files. This makes your media instantly easier to find, group, and organize using Finderâ€™s built-in tags system.

The initial release supports **DaVinci Resolve**:  
You can now automatically assign Finder Tags to your media based on the `Keywords` metadata exported from Resolve. Future updates will expand this workflow to support metadata from other leading NLEs as well.

You can also choose how tags are managed:
- **`Add`**: Add new tags from your metadata file to each fileâ€™s existing tags. This preserves all current color tags and custom tags, simply adding any new ones for richer organization.

- **`Overwrite`**: Remove all existing Finder tags from your files and apply only the tags specified in your metadata. This is ideal when you want your Finder tags to exactly match your exported metadata.

- **`Remove`**: Delete only the tags listed in your metadata from your files, leaving all other tags in place. Use this for quick cleanup or to undo previous tagging actions.

With **Apply Finder Tag**, we complete the round trip by bringing organizational metadata from your NLEs back into Finder Tagsâ€”closing the cycle and enabling seamless metadata interchange between your Mac and your editing software. ðŸ”„

This gives you complete control to fit your workflow needs.

**Detailed Reporting & Full Transparency**

After tagging, evrExpanse creates a dedicated report folder next to your metadata file. Inside, youâ€™ll find color-coded logs for all processed files, missing files, and any duplicates that were skippedâ€”making it easy to review your tagging results right in Finder.
