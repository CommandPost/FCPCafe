**Whatâ€™s New in v6?**

Weâ€™re excited to introduce **ðŸ“Œ Apply Finder Tag**â€”a powerful new feature in v6 that allows you to apply Finder Tags to your files using metadata.

The initial release supports **DaVinci Resolve**:  
You can now automatically assign Finder Tags to your media based on the *Keywords* metadata exported from Resolve. Future updates will expand this workflow to support metadata from other leading NLEs as well.

You can also choose how tags are managed:
- **Append** to existing Finder Tags
- **Overwrite** existing Finder Tags
- **Remove** all Finder Tags

This gives you complete control to fit your workflow needs.

As you may know, evrExpanse has long supported exporting Finder Tags for import into NLEs. Now, with **Apply Finder Tag**, we complete the round trip by bringing organizational metadata from your NLEs back into Finder Tagsâ€”closing the cycle and enabling seamless metadata interchange between your Mac and your editing software. ðŸ”„
