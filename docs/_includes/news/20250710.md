#### Background

Pipeline Neo is a modern Swift framework and spiritual successor to the original [Pipeline](https://github.com/reuelk/pipeline), designed for professional video editing workflows. Built with Swift 6.0 and targeting macOS 12+, it provides a comprehensive API for parsing, creating, and manipulating FCPXML files with advanced timecode operations, async/await patterns, and robust error handling.

The framework seamlessly integrates with [TimecodeKit](https://github.com/orchetect/TimecodeKit) to deliver type-safe operations for professional video editing environments. Pipeline Neo is currently in experimental development, focusing on core functionality while providing a foundation for future expansion. The entire codebase has been developed and refined using AI-assisted development practices.

#### AI Agent Development Collaboration

Pipeline Neo is refactored and developed using AI agents. [Vigneswaran Rajkumar](https://bsky.app/profile/vigneswaranrajkumar.com) welcomes developers interested in maintaining or contributing to the project through similar AI-assisted development approaches. Those passionate about AI-driven development workflows and looking to collaborate on expanding Pipeline Neo's capabilities are encouraged to reach out.

Developers with experience in AI agent development and FCPXML processing are invited to contact Vigneswaran Rajkumar for repository access and collaboration on advancing the framework's functionality.
