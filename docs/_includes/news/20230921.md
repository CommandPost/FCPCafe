### [21st September 2023](/news/20230921)

Yesterday Apple released updates to Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro for iPad, Motion and Pro Video Formats.

These updates drop support for macOS Monterey - only macOS Ventura and Sonoma are now supported, which is disappointing, but not surprising.

Unfortunately we've already had reports from [FxFactory](https://fxfactory.com) that the Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 update has at least one serious bug.

**FxFactory** writes:

> Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 is now available on the Mac App Store. This version breaks all FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.
>
> Regrettably this constitutes the entirety of our catalog featuring object tracking or face detection, since developers and users alike have come to favor the Title layer for its flexibility.
>
> Because of the large number of products affected, we recommend that you do not apply this update.

Sadly, Apple doesn't provide beta releases to most third party developers, so it's a mad scramble to test and review updates once they're made public.

We're currently in the process of testing and reviewing all the updates, and will post more on FCP Cafe as new things come to light.

You can find our **Update Recommendations** [here](/update-guide).

If you run into any issues, make sure you report them in our [Bug Tracker](/bugtracker/).

For developers, Apple has also updated the FxPlug 4 SDK.

At this stage, there's been no update to the Workflow Extensions SDK (currently at v1.0.2, released in January).

The **FxPlug 4.2.8 SDK** includes the following:

- Removal of unsupported FxPlug 3 properties from the FxPlug framework
- Support for GPU and backwards analysis in the `FxBrightnessAnalysis` example
- Plug-ins built with newer SDKs now handle canceling of analysis without crashing in older hosts.
- The template and example properties have been updated to conform to the removal of some FxPlug 3 properties. This includes the `kFxPropertyKey_UsesRationalTime` and `kFxPropertyKey_IsThreadSafe` properties.
- Fixed an issue when an FxPlug 4 plug-in with custom UI displayed in the inspector crashed, or was terminated by the OS. It will now redraw its custom controls immediately rather than waiting until the next communication with the plug-in.
- Fixed an issue with a potential crash when using the `FxColorGamutAPI`.
- Analysis no longer returns frames with a 1-pixel border around them.
