Hi, Antonio here — developer of [evrExpanse](https://www.evrapp.cloud/evrexpanse).

Version 6.3 is focused on one thing: connecting all your metadata in a simple, reliable way.

You can now **tag both videos and photos** using metadata from **DaVinci Resolve**, **Final Cut Pro**, or embedded **XMP, EXIF, and Production** data — all directly inside Finder.

Photo format support has also been added to the **Export Metadata** process, so stills and video metadata now work together across your NLEs.

### What’s New

- **Photo + Video Support** — JPG, HEIC, DNG, AVIF, TIF, and PNG are now fully supported by both the **Apply Finder Tags** and **Export Metadata** processes.  
- **Lightroom Integration** — Automatically reads XMP Keywords from Lightroom and Photoshop and applies them as Finder Tags.  
- **Creative, Camera & Clip Metadata** — Tag files using fields like Scene, Shot, Take, Title, and Description, or pull camera details directly from EXIF metadata.  
- **Smarter Batch Workflow** — Drop a folder, and evrExpanse extracts metadata and tags all supported files automatically.  
- **Metadata Tags Preferences** — Choose exactly which metadata fields are read and how each maps to Finder Tags.

With photo and video metadata now unified, **Finder becomes a practical media browser — searchable, organized, and ready for Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or other supported NLEs.**
