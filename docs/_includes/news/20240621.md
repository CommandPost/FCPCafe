### [21st June 2024](/news/20240621)

It's an exciting (and very busy) Friday here at FCP Cafe!

**Final Cut Pro v10.8**, **Final Cut Pro for iPad v2.0**, **Final Cut Camera v1.0**, **Motion v5.8**, **Compressor v4.8** are all out now!

**iMovie v10.4.1** is out with stability and performance improvements.

**Pro Video Formats v2.3.1** is out now.

For developers, **FxPlug v4.3** is also out now, along with **FCPXML v1.12**.

The new **Color Adjustments** feature in Final Cut Pro 10.8 is definitely our favourite new addition, although renaming Effects will be pretty handy too.

Final Cut Pro v10.8 and Final Cut Pro for iPad v2.0 have a new library database version (now `1110` compared to `1090` in 10.7.1), so you'll need to update older libraries.

_**We strongly recommend making a backup of all Final Cut Pro Libraries before updating them!**_

**Transfer Toolbox v1.2.0** is also out today, allowing you to move Libraries from Final Cut Pro v10.8 to Final Cut Pro 2.0 (for iPad).

You can learn more and download for free [here](https://transfertoolbox.fcp.cafe).

**Arctic v24.2.0** is also out today with Final Cut Pro 10.8 support.

Sadly, unlike some Final Cut Pro YouTuber's and Trainers, we don't get early access to these Final Cut Pro updates, so we are currently carefully testing and reviewing all these changes, and how they affect our own apps and workflows.

We will post our test results over on our [Should I Update?](/update-guide/) page as we learn new things.

So far we can confirm that [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) and [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.fcp.cafe) both seem to be working great! If you spot any issues, please reach out.

We will aim to add **Color Adjustments** support to CommandPost in the coming weeks, so that you can control all the parameters with your preferred control surface.

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.fcp.cafe) will also be updated soon to support FCPXML v1.12.

**Matthew O'Brien** has already reported some weirdness in Final Cut Pro 10.8 on [Twitter](https://x.com/matthewtobrien/status/1803950906494587247?s=46&t=rAqnb4ykI8KSBTwguvX5fg), however we haven't been able to reproduce.

_**As always, before updating, please make sure you make a backup of the Final Cut Pro application, and your existing Final Cut Pro Libraries.**_

Final Cut Pro 10.8 removes support for DVD & BluRay burning. However, you can always keep a copy of Final Cut Pro 10.7.1 handy or buy **Toast 20 Pro** at a discounted price for a limited time [here](https://www.roxio.com/en/products/toast/pro/?promo=EUXG).
