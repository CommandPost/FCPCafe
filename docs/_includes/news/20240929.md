**MotionVFX** is working on something new, and something really cool, most likely called **mExtension**.

We can only ASSUME that it's a new Workflow Extension based off their videos...

It looks like it has:

- Addons
- Backgrounds
- Camera Movements
- Compositing Elements
- Effects
- Infographics
- Intros
- Overlay Effects
- Placeholders
- Social Media
- Transitions

To be honest, we're surprised it's taken them this long to build a Workflow Extension, as normally MotionVFX are first to market when it comes to Final Cut Pro tech.

Their [first hint](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TEnRzu-N02I) was:

> A new era of creativity is on the horizon... ‚ú®

Their [second hint](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H7_fXYfeXyI) was:

> Something big is coming... üëÄ

Their [third hint](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Z2HLHqyT2E) was:

> Final Cut Pro is about to get bigger! üí£

And their [latest hint](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LZdhdqYFc6A) is:

> Open endless opportunities in Final Cut Pro ‚ôæÔ∏è #videoediting

You can see some screenshots of the above videos here:

It's yet to be seen if this will be subscription or if it just has access to your existing MotionVFX purchases.

We're excited.
