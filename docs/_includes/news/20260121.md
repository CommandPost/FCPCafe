### [21st January 2026](/news/20260121)

At the start of last year I was invited to be a guest on [Ascent Media's podcast](https://ascentmedia.com.au/ascendyourstory).

To be honest, last year was a bit of a rollercoaster for a million different reasons, so when the podcast was publicly released last September, I completely forgot to share it publicly!

If you want to see me ranting for an hour about all things nerdy, you can watch my Ascend Your Story podcast episode on YouTube:

You can also find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/25ZzfVgQbwAO6CQpcCA2nJ?si=e3644f8772614b9e) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/ascend-your-story/id1814501879?i=1000708524202)

Thanks heaps Sam for having me on the show!

Following on from our Custom Workspaces discussions, Daniel Szimuly [writes](https://x.com/danielszimuly/status/2013591978294841710):

> I still have a really annoying bug with the normal way of using workspaces. When I use a 3-monitor setup, 2 horizontal and 1 vertical, FCP constantly signs the second monitor to the horizontal one, even though I want it to be vertical.

I know a few people have used CommandPost to work around these kinds of complex 3+ monitor setups - so if you have any ideas or suggestions for Daniel please share them in the comments! Thanks team!
