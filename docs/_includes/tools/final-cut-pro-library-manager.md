Final Cut Library Manager instantly displays all of the Final Cut Pro X libraries that it finds on your Spotlight-indexed drives. When a Library references external media Final Cut Library Manager will automatically create a group to clearly present the distribution of these media files across your system. You can also add other sources : including external disks, or folders, including those not indexed by spotlight.
