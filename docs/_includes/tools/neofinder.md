### NeoFinder

**NeoFinder** (formally CDFinder) quickly catalogs and manages your entire media and disk library, and your backup archive.

The Holy Grail of Media Asset Management (according to ZDNet).

NeoFinder keeps track of your documents, photos, songs, movies, and folders wherever they are stored.

NeoFinder is your digital treasure chest! It even manages your Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer documents.

Catalog your digital data: SSD, hard disks (internal, external, USB, FireWire, Thunderbolt, HFS+, APFS, NTFS, ExFAT, FAT32), server volumes (AFP, SMB, FTP, Dropbox, Backblaze B2), Blu-rays, LTO volumes, USB sticks, DVD-ROMs, Audio-CDs, and get a full inventory of all files, folders, and important metadata, including thumbnails for your photos, songs, video files and other documents.

Find your files NOW! Whatever you need to find, NeoFinder knows where it is! If you are a desktop user, or work in a small or large network, you stay in control of your data at any time.

I've been using NeoFinder for over a decade now. We have hundreds of external hard drives and hundreds of LTOs all catalogued.

We store our NeoFinder database on Dropbox and share it between all our staff. It's rock solid and amazing.
