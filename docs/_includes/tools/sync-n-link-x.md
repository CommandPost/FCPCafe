### Sync-N-Link X

“AutoSync” for Final Cut Pro X: batch sync dual-system sound using jam-synced SMPTE/EBU timecode.

Eliminate the time-consuming chore of manually synchronizing dailies (a.k.a. rushes) by batch processing an Event of unsynchronized clips exported from Final Cut Pro X.

Sync-N-Link X looks for audio whose free-run Timecode matches a video clip’s Timecode (although a matching video and audio clip don’t have to start at the same time, have the same duration, or even have the same frame rate).

Sync-N-Link X uses content created dates to find video and audio that were recorded on the same day for syncing.

Choose whether the synchronized clips are named after the video or audio clips - the original video and audio clip names are available inside the synchronized clips.

Synchronized clips can contain more than one audio clip (for cases where audio recording was stop/started during a take).

Sync-N-Link X adds a "Synced" keyword for the video range (essentially trimming the clip to the video duration). Any unused video and audio clips are marked with a "Not Synced" keyword.

Sync-N-Link X assigns audio Subroles and component names to second-system audio tracks and camera audio, giving the user dynamic control over audio playback during editorial.
