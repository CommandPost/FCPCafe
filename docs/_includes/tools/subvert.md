### Subvert

Subvert expands on Final Cut Pro X's captioning capabilities. It makes editing with captioned footage easy and powerful.

Subvert is a great app to deal with subtitles in FCP. You provide a SRT file and it will create a FCPXML with Captions or Titles. You can precise the Role Name and choose the Text Settings.

When the FCPXML is converted, it can automatically open the FCPXML in FCP, which is very convenient. It will let you choose which library to import the XML into and then it will create a “Subtitles” event.

Something very nice about those Titles: the name of the Titles is matching the content of the Title. So that you can search directly into the index the content of your Titles. And if you want to change what’s written inside the Titles, its name will change accordingly.

It’s also possible to go the other way around. Export a FCPXML of your project with your Titles, and then you’ll be able to convert it into SRT file.

The app is available in the Mac App Store for 19.90USD.

I use Subvert. Love it.
I remember I prefered Subvert, because when you change the text of the subtitle, it also change the name of the title. So it’s very convenient for searching in the index.
