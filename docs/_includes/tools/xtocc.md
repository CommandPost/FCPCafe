### XtoCC

The all-in-one tool to move a Final Cut Pro X Event or Project to Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, FCP 7 and beyond!

This app translates Final Cut Pro X Library XML (fcpxml) and converts it for import into Adobe's Creative Cloud apps, Premiere Pro CS6, Final Cut Pro 6 or 7, or other applications.

Your Final Cut Pro XML is ready for:

- Premiere Pro, and then to:
- AAF to Avid Media Composer and Pro Tools
- OMF output for ProTools, etc.
- EDL
- After Effects
- Audition
- Final Cut Pro 7
- other Final Cut Pro 7 XML workflow tools

Check the XtoCC Support document for instructions, including listings of what translates and what doesn't.

Requirements:

- Final Cut Pro version 10.0.1 or later
- An application that imports Final Cut Pro XML (such as Final Cut Pro 7 or 6, Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, Audition CC, DaVinci Resolve, Color, etc.)
