### CommandPost

CommandPost is a **free** and [open source](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md){target="_blank"} macOS application that bridges between control surfaces and software that doesn’t support them natively, such as Apple’s [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/){target="_blank"} and Adobe’s [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html){target="_blank"}.

It’s been downloaded over [163 thousand times](https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=commandpost&repo=commandpost){target="_blank"}, and there are over [2.6 thousands members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/members){target="_blank"} in our [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/){target="_blank"}.

It’s been translated into Arabic, Bengali, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Norwegian, Panjabi/Punjabi, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian & Vietnamese by [our awesome community](https://poeditor.com/join/project/QWvOQlF1Sy){target="_blank"}.

It’s used by filmmakers, developers, scientists and macOS power users all over the world to seriously speed up mundane tasks through powerful and customisable automation tools.

For example, you can apply individual effects within Final Cut Pro or After Effects with the single tap of a button.

Powered by [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/){target="_blank"} (the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/){target="_blank"}, [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html){target="_blank"} and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792){target="_blank"}), it's insanely customisable and powerful.

It runs natively on Apple Silicon and is fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org){target="_blank"}.

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html){target="_blank"} and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html){target="_blank"}.

CommandPost and FCP are so intertwined on my day to day that I see them as one app.<br />

As someone who doesn’t like clicking to do things, CommandPost makes my work much more likeable.<br />
