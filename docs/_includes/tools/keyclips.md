### KeyClips

The MovieSlate KeyClips app organizes Final Cut Pro X (FCPX) media into category folders, keywords, selects, and sequences- with notes, markers, and optional bottom-third titles. This helps Editors quickly find the exact footage they need.

While filming a production: log shots, notes, and/or keywords with our MovieSlate 8 app (for iOS). The KeyClips app (for macOS) matches logged MovieSlate metadata with FCPX media to intelligently generate FCPX rough-cut sequences, keywords, selects, notes, and markers.

Two Logging Workflows are supported, and can be used together or separately:

1. Shot-based workflow: project/date/clipname data is used to match log data with clips- well suited for script-based shoots. Log this data from MovieSlate's "Slate" and/or "Camera" tabs.

2. Keyword-based workflow: project/date/timecode is used to match log data with clips- well suited for documentary, reality, and interview shoots. Log this data from MovieSlate's "KeyClips" tab (part of an optional PRO Features subscription; available from MovieSlate's Settings > Store).

How it Works:

1. Logging. Log shots, notes, and/or keywords from MovieSlate 8. Once logging is complete, tap the share button to send the logged data to a Mac running macOS Yosemite (v10.10) or newer.

2. Log+Clip Matching. Run the KeyClips app on macos- which imports logged data from MovieSlate; imports fcpxml files from FCPX; matches logs and clips; builds new fcpxml; and sends its new fcpxml to FCPX.

3. FCPX Organizing. FCPX imports the KeyClips app's new fcpxml file- creating events with category folders, selects, markers, notes, sequences, and bottom-third titles.
