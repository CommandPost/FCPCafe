Media Sync Tool is a revolutionary sync tool for Final Cut Pro.

By utilizing jam-synced SMPTE timecode and metadata from the source media, it automates the sync process to the point where almost no human involvement is required, while automatically dealing with overlapped timecode.

Now all Final Cut Pro video editors can fully eliminate the time-consuming routine of manually syncing dailies by using Media Sync Tool in a bundle with Final Cut Pro.
