### PostWatch

Alerts from Post-Production applications and macOS sent to the Pushover smartphone app.

_“Is that file done yet?”_

Working remotely, in the next room or out for a walk?
Need to know as soon as that export or transcode is finished?
Need to know about applications crashing, power going out with out knowing or drives failing or running out of space while you are away?

Now this and more is possible!

PostWatch uses the established subscription free service, for iOS and Android, Pushover to create a dedicated, clean and reliable experience for receiving alerts. What It does not do is clutter up your inbox with texts or emails that often get lost or forgotten.

PostWatch not only alerts you when 14 different Mac apps have completed exporting/encoding, it also monitors the Mac for issues; Such as accidental ejected disks, app crashes/freezes, power loss and more.

No plugins, special application settings or rendering to watch folders. (except setting a few system preferences) Export, render and transcode as you normally do and PostWatch does its magic in the background.
