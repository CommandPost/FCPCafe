### Media Copy 4.0

Automatic Duckâ€™s Media Copy is a very helpful utility that reads Avid AAF exports or XML files from Final Cut Pro, then copies the media files referenced by the project to a location you specify. This makes it very easy to identify and copy the media you need for a specific AAF or XML File. You can archive the media, or perhaps send to another computer.
