### PostSync

More than just sync, PostSync helps prepare your macOS workstation for the daily demands of your post-production workflow.

PostSync is a multi-use tool that is designed as a macOS startup utility; syncing templates and presets, clearing caches, connecting shares, launching apps, etc. But it has many uses beyond that…

PostSync can synchronize 30 different presets and templates (plus user fonts) between several edit workstations to keep all systems current. It can also help when transitioning to working remotely by copying these files to a thumb drive and transferring them to a second workstation. Or the same function can simply be used to create a backup of these files.

PostSync can also backup and restore/transfer application general preferences from Final Cut Pro, Premiere Pro, After Effects and DaVinci Resolve. It makes setting up a new workstation easier.

PostSync can help with nightly cleanup of render/cache files by clearing older files by a set date. Completely customizable for any folder on your Mac.

All this can be done either manually or completely automatic using a Calendar event or launched at login.

Your choice… PostSync is built to be easy to setup and very customizable.
