### What is disableDRT in a FCPXML?

**DRT** is **dynamic range tracking**.

It’s an internal name the Final Cut Pro team use for the new automatic HDR settings.

The **disableDRT** setting in the FCPXML tells the app not to enable the automatic HDR settings on older projects created before the setting existed.

If you have existing projects and want to ensure they render the same as they did in previous versions, you don’t want to touch that value.
