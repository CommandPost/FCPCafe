### Gyroflow Toolbox

**Gyroflow Toolbox** allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Final Cut Pro.

Gyroflow is a free and open source third-party application that can stabilise your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and Gyroflow stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

Gyroflow Toolbox allows you to take the stabilised data from Gyroflow and use it within Final Cut Pro as an effect, so you don't have to export a ProRes from Gyroflow!

You can even use this in conjunction with BRAW Toolbox (also on the App Store), to stabilise Blackmagic RAW files!

None of this would be possible without the incredible Gyroflow project and the incredibly help and support from their main developer, AdrianEddy.

The Best Way to Stabilize Pro Res RAW
I record both internally and externally with an Atomos Ninja, on my FX3 with the end goal of delivering HDR. I record internal to capture Gyroscopic data that my FX3 records. This allows me to Use GryoFlow, and Thus GryoFlow Toolbox to stabilize Pro Res RAW footage. This tool has made it possible, and works awesomely. I highly recommend this tool it will help immensely.
