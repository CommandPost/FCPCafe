## Custom Tools

If you have a specific post production workflow problem you need to solve or automate, we can help.

We’ve developed custom plugins and solutions for post production studios, production companies, and individual editors all over the world.

For example, we developed a transcription plugin for [Apollo: Missions to the Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9782756/) (edited by [David Tillman](https://twitter.com/davidtillman)) as well as specific CommandPost features for Denmark’s second largest production company, [Metronome Productions](https://web.archive.org/web/20220629061650/https://fcp.co/final-cut-pro/news/867-metronome-celebrate-a-documentary-series-cut-on-fcpx-with-a-birthday-cake).

The **FCPXML Titles Processor**, **Shot Data** and **Titles to Keywords** in CommandPost’s Toolbox are other examples of commissioned tools.

[LUT Robot](https://lutrobot.pro) and [News Import](https://latenitefilms.github.io/NewsImport/) are other examples of tools we've built for specific productions, but have also released publicly.
