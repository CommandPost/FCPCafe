### LUT Robot

**LUT Robot** allows you to automatically apply Camera LUTs with matching filenames.

When working on big long-form projects, such as feature films and television shows, DITs on-set create unique Camera LUTs for each shot.

For example, the production might be shooting on an ARRI Alexa and when they hand over the rushes, they also hand over LUTs for each camera file.

LUT Robot automatically applies Camera LUTs with matching filenames, saving hours of work for Assistant Editors, who until now, had to manually set the Camera LUT for each clip.

You can select a specific sub-folder within your Camera LUTs folder to scan.

This is a simple niche app, that saves high-end professional assistant editors using Final Cut Pro hours of time.
