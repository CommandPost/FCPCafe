### Recall Toolbox

**Recall Toolbox** is a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension that acts as a Shared Pasteboard.

Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store.

#### Build for Final Cut Pro

There are third party tools like the amazing Copy 'Em â€‹(for Mac), but they're not quite as visual as Recall Toolbox, and they're not built from the ground up for Final Cut Pro users.

Recall Toolbox works as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, so it's window position gets saved with your custom Workspaces.

Whilst CommandPost has had a Shared Pasteboard & Pasteboard Buffers for years, it's really optimised for Control Surfaces. You can access the Shared Pasteboard from the CommandPost menubar, and it is super powerful, but it's not as visual - you just get text, not a fully customisable thumbnail.

Recall Toolbox feels like a natural extension to Final Cut Pro, with a similar look and feel to Final Cut Pro's Effects Browser.

#### iCloud Sync

Recall Toolbox automatically syncs to ALL your devices on the same iCloud account automagically!

#### iCloud Sharing

You can share folders with other iCloud users, and control permissions. For example, you could have a "read only" folder that contains client logos for a current job!
