Constantly looking for ways to innovate, LateNite is as passionate about production and post production as it is storytelling. Their pursuit of creative excellence has seen them work closely with global cinematic technology companies to craft post workflow solutions and critically celebrated software in-house.

## In Development

Here's a **sneak peak** of some of the things we have in development.

Exact shipping dates may vary, as all these ideas are still in active development, and subject to things like TestFlight & App Store approval, etc.

---

### Timecode Toolbox

**ETA: July 2023**

We're spinning out the Sony Timecode Repair Toolbox from CommandPost and making it a standalone app.

In addition to the current functionality, you'll also be able to modify the original camera files to add Final Cut Pro friendly timecode.

---

### Metadata Toolbox

**ETA: August 2023**

**Metadata Toolbox** is a Workflow Extension that allows you to drag in a project, select burn-in metadata options, then drag a Compound Clip back to the timeline with all the metadata as titles.

---

### RAW Toolbox

**ETA: September 2023**

Following in the footsteps of [BRAW Toolbox](#braw-toolbox), RAW Toolbox will initially add Nikon N-RAW support to Final Cut Pro.

---

### Import Toolbox

**ETA: October 2023**

**Import Toolbox** will be a Workflow Extension that allows you to import files with better metadata and preset controls (i.e. clip volume).

We will also be spinning out the **Watch Folders** from CommandPost and moving them into this app.

---

### Assistant Toolbox

**ETA: November 2023**

**Assistant Toolbox** will be a Workflow Extension that spins out **Titles to Keywords** and **Auto Sequence** from CommandPost.

It'll include various improvements and enhancements to make the job even easier for Assistant Editors working on long-form feature film projects.

### Magic Toolbox

**ETA: December 2023**

**Magic Toolbox** is our first Machine Learning experiment.

You'll be able to add titles to the timeline, to trigger Machine Learning actions such as:

- **SUBTITLES** - Analyses the audio and adds subtitles
- **NARRATION** - Turns text into speech in a narration tone
- **VOICE** - Turns text into speech based on your description
- **GRADE** - Adds Color Effects based on your description
- **MUSIC** - Adds stock music or machine learning generated music based on your description
- **SFX** - Adds sound effects from places like FreeSound.org
- **VIDEO** - Adds machine learning generated video based on your description

Magic Toolbox will use existing services like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) and [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io) - and it'll be BYO API Key.
