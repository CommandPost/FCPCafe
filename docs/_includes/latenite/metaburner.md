You can access it via a **Title** in the Titles sidebar.

Metaburner gives you **25 text layers** that you can populate with whatever metadata you want.

You can even stack multiple Metaburner Titles on top of each other for **unlimited** metadata fields!

To begin, simply drag your Final Cut Pro Project from the Browser into the Metaburner Title Inspector via a drop zone, and then Metaburner has full access to everything that's in the FCPXML.

There's also a **Lua scripting environment** built-in, so you can even "code" your own text for unlimited possibilities.

You can even share Lua variables between multiple Metaburner titles for some crazy possibilities!
