# Explore LateNite's Tools

## Introduction

This website has been thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) from [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com).

**LateNite** is an independent production studio committed to investing in emerging creatives with strong, unique voices, helping tell their stories in a creatively supportive and collaborative environment. Our work uses humour to explore outsider stories that are unmistakably human and straddle the line between light and dark.

Constantly looking for ways to innovate, at LateNite we're as passionate about production and post production as we are about storytelling.

Our pursuit of creative excellence has seen us work closely with global cinematic technology companies to craft post workflow solutions and critically celebrated software in-house.

For example, our debut free and open-source application **CommandPost**, has been downloaded over **[258 thousand times](https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=commandpost&repo=commandpost)**.

It's been used for projects at **Netflix**, **Pixar** and the **BBC**. People at companies such as **Apple**, **Avid** and **Adobe** use it daily.

All of the 2024 and 2025 **Apple WWDC** videos were graded using [Tangent panels](https://www.tangentwave.co.uk) in Final Cut Pro controlled by [CommandPost](https://commandpost.fcp.cafe). 🥳

This page showcases all the stuff we've build, throw together and collaborated on. Enjoy!
