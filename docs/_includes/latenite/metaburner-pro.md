### Metaburner Pro

**Metaburner Pro** is a Metadata Generator for Final Cut Pro.

> Metaburner Pro is currently in **early development**.
>
> If you're interested in helping with development, you can sign up to **TestFlight** [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dw7S2veN).

You can access it via a **Title** in the Titles sidebar.

Metaburner Pro gives you **25 text layers** that you can populate with whatever metadata you want.

You can even stack multiple Metaburner Pro Titles on top of each other for UNLIMITED titles!

You can import your Final Cut Pro project/timeline back into the Metaburner Pro Title via a drop zone, so Metaburner Pro has full access to everything that's in the FCPXML.
