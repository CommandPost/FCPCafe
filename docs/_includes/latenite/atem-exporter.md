### ATEM Exporter

**ATEM Exporter** is a native Swift + Swift UI Mac Application that listens to a [Blackmagic ATEM switcher](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/atem), and logs all the camera changes.

You can export the camera changes as a Final Cut Pro `FCPXML`, to use in Final Cut Pro or Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve.

You can export a **Program Cut**, which allows you to use your program feed from an external recorder (such as a [Blackmagic HyperDeck](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/hyperdeck)), and add cut points each time there's a camera change.

You can also export a **Multicam**, which allows you to use your program feed as well as any ISO (i.e. independent camera) recordings, and export a Multicam clip for Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve.

ATEM Exporter was built in a few hours during a live event, and has **only** currently been tested in a real-world live production using an **Blackmagic ATEM Constellation 8K**, Blackmagic HyperDeck's and AJA recorders for ISOs - so we welcome any user feedback for other ATEM's!

We're currently just using a placeholder icon (from [Timecode Toolbox](https://fcp.cafe/latenite/#timecode-toolbox)) whilst a new one is being designed - stay tuned!
