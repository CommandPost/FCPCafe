### Marker Toolbox

**Marker Toolbox** allows you to import Vimeo CSV, Wipster CSV, Dropbox Replay JSON & Email Comments into Apple's Final Cut Pro via a handy Workflow Extension.

You can also OPTIONALLY use OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate email comments into markers using your own personal OpenAI API key!

If you use Vimeo Review pages or Wipster to share video edits with clients to consolidate feedback, you can simply export a CSV file from Vimeo or Wipster, and drag it into the Workflow Extension to convert the comments into Markers within Final Cut Pro. It's fast and easy!

Dropbox Replay works exactly the same way, except Marker Toolbox will also import any drawn annotations!

Similar to Frame.io's Workflow Extension, the markers come in as a Compound Clip, that you can then "break apart" so that the markers are attached to the clips in your Primary Storyline, meaning that your clients comments stay in the correct position as you make revisions to the edit. For each marker, there's also a title, so that you can easily visually see the comments right in your Viewer - this is great if you need to export an edit with all your client feedback "burnt" into the export.

Replies and the date the comment was added can be included in the Marker names. It also takes "resolved" comments in Vimeo, Wipster & Dropbox Replay, and marks them as "completed" in Final Cut Pro!

You can also easily copy and paste client feedback from emails into the Workflow Extension. In most cases, you can use the "Process Comments Locally" button to use a custom-built algorithm that converts each line of text into a comment. However, you can also the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate more complicated feedback into markers. You can customise the ChatGPT prompt, and also pick the ChatGPT Model. You supply your own OpenAI API key, giving you full control.

This can be a MASSIVE time saver, as you can simply copy and paste a long list of email comments, and ChatGPT will do the work to convert them into easy-to-read Final Cut Pro markers, that you can then easily navigate via the Timeline Index.

Marker Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 or later.

Excellent addition to FCP
This is a great tool. I have my clients make notes on Vimeo, and Marker Toolbox lets me download a .csv of those comments and create markers on the FCP project/timeline at the proper locations, with notes visible and that will follow the clips as I move them. Once downloaded and installed it's easy. Downloading the .csv and running it through Marker Toolbox and adding the Markers to the project/timeline takes less than a minute, then you're ready to go. Really great find!

Amazing simple
I wanted an app like this since I started editing. Now for the first time I can process the comments I get via an e-mail on an edit from the start and not, as I usualy do, begin at the end of the edit and work backwards.
