### CommandPost

CommandPost is a **free** and [open source](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/LICENSE.md){target="_blank"} macOS application that bridges between control surfaces and software that doesn’t support them natively, such as Apple’s [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/){target="_blank"} and Adobe’s [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html){target="_blank"}.

It’s been downloaded over [163 thousand times](https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=commandpost&repo=commandpost){target="_blank"}, and there are over [2.6 thousands members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/members){target="_blank"} in our [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/commandpost/){target="_blank"}.

It’s been translated into Arabic, Bengali, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Norwegian, Panjabi/Punjabi, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian & Vietnamese by [our awesome community](https://poeditor.com/join/project/QWvOQlF1Sy){target="_blank"}.

It’s used by filmmakers, developers, scientists and macOS power users all over the world to seriously speed up mundane tasks through powerful and customisable automation tools.

For example, you can apply individual effects within Final Cut Pro or After Effects with the single tap of a button.

Powered by [Lua](https://dev.commandpost.io/lua/overview/){target="_blank"} (the same scripting language used by [Blackmagic Fusion](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/){target="_blank"}, [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/photoshop-lightroom.html){target="_blank"} and even parts of [Apple iOS](https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1026173832527265792){target="_blank"}), it's insanely customisable and powerful.

It runs natively on Apple Silicon and is fully compatible with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org){target="_blank"}.

You can listen to Chris explain CommandPost on Final Cut Pro Radio [Episode #57](http://fcpradio.com/episode057.html){target="_blank"} and [Episode #43](http://fcpradio.com/episodes/episode043.html){target="_blank"}.

It can quickly find and execute any obscure command, NLE and OS-wide, fire up keyboard makros (scripts), and especially, find and place Effects and Effect Templates, directly onto selected clips in my FCP timeline. It constantly saves me clicks. ”_<br />

> _“ Chris, you have no idea how helpful your Titles to Keywords toolbox has been on our latest production. Without the toolbox these 2-3 hour long timelines (around 900 keywords) would have been nearly impossible to tag with the FCP built in way. It's very long scenes with around 50 lines of text for all characters. ”_<br />
