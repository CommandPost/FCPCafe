### Rename Avid MXF Files

This simple Python script is used to rename MXF files generated from Avid Media Composer to match the **Package Name** in their metadata.

The script can process a **single file** or a **folder** containing multiple MXF files.

This is useful if you want to move native Avid MXF files from Avid Media Composer to Final Cut Pro.

This script is very basic, and doesn't contain any special error handling or messaging. It may not work in all use cases.

You should duplicate the MXF files you want to process prior to using, as there's no "undo" once you run the script.
