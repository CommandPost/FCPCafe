### BRAW Toolbox

**BRAW Toolbox** allows you to import Blackmagic RAW files directly into Final Cut Pro without transcoding.

No more waiting. No more transcoding. No more massive ProRes files.

Save hours of time, and terabytes of storage!

The BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension allows you to prepare all of your footage prior to import. You can easily and quickly change all the RAW parameters, and copy and paste settings from different BRAW clips. You can even save and restore Presets that contain specific parameters, saving time for example, if you always use the same Gamut & Gamma.

Once imported into Final Cut Pro, you can still modify the RAW parameters at any time.

You can even keyframe the ISO, Exposure, Color Temp, Tint and Custom Gamma Controls!

BRAW Toolbox comes with a Metadata View that allows you to view every piece of BRAW Metadata directly within the Final Cut Pro Inspector.

There are automatic Decode Quality options for both HD and UltraHD projects, and you can also work at a low Decode Quality, then apply a "Global Setting" to force Full Quality prior to exporting - meaning you never have to worry about creating proxies for performance. BRAW Toolbox gives you complete freedom and flexibility.

You can also use the Workflow Extension to send your project/timeline to DaVinci Resolve for grading - all using BRAW files directly from the camera!

BRAW Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 or later.

This developer did what Apple Couldn't/Wouldn't
This app is a great solution to a common problem Final Cut Pro users have: getting Blackmagic Raw footage into the app. At first it might seem like a bizarre workaround, but you only have to go through the process of setting it up once, and then you can easily import your Blackmagic footage right into FCP. Honestly, from that point on it works so incredibly well that I really struggle to understand why Apple has made it so difficult. Except it's not difficult, not anymore. This is great software: a small developer solving a problem that a big one (Apple) can't. That's innovation, my friends.

The tool we have dreamed of is here.
For lovers of Final Cut Pro who have struggled with the endless BRAW proxy XML loop, this is a dream come true. BRAW natively inside Final Cut. Controls for RAW adjustments at your fingertips. Is it the full Resolve interface? No, doesnt need to be, Between BRAW ToolBox and FCP, most edits can be done natively without ever having the leave the Final Cut NLE. If you shoot any BRAW camera, this is the best of both worlds if you live in the FCP ecosystem. Thank you latenightfilms team for this, its a huge step forward and a wonderful plugin.

I've been waiting for this!
I can finally use my two Blackmagic cameras and shoot in BRAW. As a Final Cut Pro editor, I'm really excited. The app is working great! I really appreciate the team at LateNite for all the hard work it took to get this up and running. Well worth the money to be able to handle BRAW seamlessly.
