### Alteon.io for Final Cut Pro

Designed for content creators, Alteon lets you upload, transcode, share and collaborate on media from a single, universal space.

- Collaborate remotely with secure screener links and automatic proxies
- Stop shipping drives between collaborators and clients
- Scale your cloud storage, so you spend less on archived assets
- Consolidate single-purpose apps into a streamlined workflow

This app contains Alteon’s workflow extension for Final Cut Pro, helping creatives complete an end-to-end workflow—downloading files, syncing with remote collaborators and uploading media—all within Apple’s flagship NLE.

Users can launch the workflow extension within Final Cut Pro to view media files housed in Alteon’s secure cloud storage platform. From there, they can download media files directly from Alteon into Final Cut Pro to start editing immediately. Users can upload entire libraries of media or individual clips by dragging and dropping them right from Final Cut Pro into the Alteon panel.
