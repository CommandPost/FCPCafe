### Reading Is Fundamental!

**Reading is Fundamental!** is a versatile, multi-format document reader in a Workflow Extension so you can read documents without leaving Final Cut Pro.

Reading is Fundamental! reads and displays:

- PDF
- Word (.doc and .docx)
- Pages
- Excel (.xls and .xlsx)
- Numbers
- PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)
- Keynote
- Comma-separated values (.csv)
- Rich Text Format (.rtf and .rtfd)
- Plain text (.txt)

Most document types allow you to zoom in and out by using your trackpad’s “pinch with two fingers” — if you’ve enabled this in **System Preferences > Trackpad**. (Not supported by Rich Text Format or Plain Text files.)

Multiple documents can be opened at the same time, and you can switch between them (using navigation arrow buttons or the popup menu).

The previously opened documents will be restored on relaunch.

The workflow extension window floats above Final Cut Pro so you can view your document and project timeline at the same time.

The workflow extension window can be repositioned, resized, and saved as part of a Final Cut Pro workspace layout.
