# Bug Tracker

This page is dedicated to keeping track of the latest Final Cut Pro bugs and issues.

We keep track of these bugs via our [GitHub issues site](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues){target="_blank"}.

[GitHub](https://github.com){target="_blank"} is a **safe and secure** developers platform used by **over 73 million users** worldwide.

To submit a new bug report, simply sign up for a free GitHub account and post an issue [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug-report.md&title=){target="_blank"}.

If you'd prefer not to use GitHub, then you can always email us your bug report: [support@latenitefilms.com](mailto:support@latenitefilms.com?subject=Bug Report)

In general, whenever posting a new bug/issue to GitHub, we also submit feedback directly to Apple via [Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com){target="_blank"}.

You can also send feedback directly to the Final Cut Pro team [here](https://www.apple.com/feedback/finalcutpro/){target="_blank"}, although unlike Feedback Assistant you can't track your request or add additional information - so we generally recommend you use Feedback Assistant instead.
