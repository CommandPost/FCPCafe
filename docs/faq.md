THINGS TO ADD (FROM COMMUNITY):
- XML workflow between PP is still a biatch.
- working remotely online / proxy editing
- captions (we now use filmora for speech to text captions)

- Media management, everything from how to setup the library and best practices to its using all my drive space to export settings.
- Backups and how to.
- Media usage, drive bandwidth, proxy, etc
- Rendering or exporting failing normally due to a corrupt rendered frame

- Why "Leave In Place", doesn't when Importing copied card structures from a drive, using the Import window. This consistently baffles and confuses folks, often resulting in the dreaded "missing camera icon", due to crashing and slowness because they are unwittingly copying media back to the source, where the media already is.

### How can I backup my Final Cut Pro project files?

Backing up your Final Cut Pro project files is crucial to prevent losing your work. Here are a few ways you can do this:

1. **Library Backups:** Final Cut Pro automatically creates backups of your libraries. These backups are stored in a folder named **Final Cut Backups** in your Movies folder. You can adjust how often these backups are made using [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io){target="_blank"}.
2. **Duplicate Libraries:** To manually back up your work, you can duplicate your library in Finder.
3. **External Drive:** You can also manually copy the library to an external hard drive or another secure location. Simply drag the library file in Finder to your backup location.
4. **Time Machine:** If you're using Apple's Time Machine backup system, make sure that your Final Cut Pro library is in a location that Time Machine backs up. Time Machine backs up your entire computer at regular intervals, so this provides a kind of automatic backup.
5. **Cloud Storage:** You can also use a cloud storage service like iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox for backups. Note that video files can be quite large, and you'll need enough storage space in your cloud service to accommodate them.

Remember to keep your backup drives or locations secure and check them regularly to make sure the backups are being performed correctly.

Before you perform any major edits or changes to a project, it's a good idea to create a backup. That way, if something goes wrong, you can go back to the backup version.

Also, keep in mind that Final Cut Pro libraries might only contain references to your media files if you're keeping your media external to the library, so it's important to also back up your media files.

### How can I improve my editing speed in Final Cut Pro?

Improving your editing speed in Final Cut Pro can be accomplished with a combination of technical skills, keyboard shortcuts, and optimizing your workflow. Here are some tips:

1. **Learn Keyboard Shortcuts**: Keyboard shortcuts can save a significant amount of time in the editing process. Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used ones, like "i" for setting an in-point, "o" for an out-point, and "space" for play/pause.

2. **Use Proxy Media**: When dealing with high-resolution video like 4K or 8K, editing can become sluggish. Use Final Cut Pro's proxy media feature, which allows you to create lower-resolution versions of your footage for smoother editing. When you're done, you can switch back to the full-resolution media for final output.

3. **Organize Your Media**: Keep your footage and assets well-organized. Use libraries, events, and keywords to categorize and manage your footage. This will make finding and accessing the clips you need much faster.

4. **Use Presets**: If you find yourself often applying the same settings or effects, save them as presets. This can be done for color grading, audio effects, and more.

5. **Optimize Your Hardware**: Make sure your computer is up to the task. Keep your software up to date, ensure you have enough free storage space, and consider upgrades to your RAM or GPU if necessary.

6. **Batch Operations**: Perform tasks such as transcoding, rendering, and exporting in batches, ideally during downtime, to avoid interrupting your editing flow.

7. **Learn to Use the Magnetic Timeline**: The magnetic timeline is one of Final Cut Pro's unique features. It helps maintain synchronization when moving clips around, which can save you time rearranging your timeline.

8. **Color Coding**: Use color coding for your clips and timelines. This can help you quickly locate related material or sequences.

9. **Use the Skimming Feature**: The skimming feature allows you to quickly review your footage and makes cutting and trimming faster.

10. **Storyboard Your Videos**: Before even starting with Final Cut Pro, have a clear idea of what you want to achieve. A storyboard or script can reduce the time spent experimenting with different edits.

Remember that like any skill, speed comes with practice. The more you use Final Cut Pro and become familiar with its features, the faster you will get.

### How do I create and manage libraries in Final Cut Pro?

Creating and managing libraries in Final Cut Pro is a fundamental part of organizing your editing projects. Here's how to create and manage libraries:

#### Creating a Library

1. Open Final Cut Pro.
2. Go to the File menu, then choose New > Library (or use the keyboard shortcut Option-Command-N).
3. A save dialog will appear. Choose where to save the library, then give it a name and click Save.

#### Managing Libraries

After creating a library, it's important to keep it organized. Here's how you can manage libraries:

1. **Creating Events**: Inside a library, you can create events, which are like folders for your media files. To create an event, select the library where you want the event, then go to File > New > Event (or use the keyboard shortcut Option-N).

2. **Importing Media**: You can import media directly into an event. To do this, select the event, then go to File > Import > Media (or use the keyboard shortcut Command-I).

3. **Moving and Copying Events**: To move or copy events between libraries, you can simply drag and drop them in the library browser.

4. **Renaming Libraries and Events**: To rename a library or event, click on its name in the library browser, then enter the new name.

5. **Deleting Libraries and Events**: To delete a library, first make sure it's closed (select it, then go to File > Close Library). Then you can delete it in Finder, like any other file. To delete an event, select it, then press the Delete key.

6. **Backing Up Libraries**: To back up a library, you can simply copy it in Finder to another location, like an external hard drive. You can also use the built-in library backup feature, which automatically saves backups to your Movies folder.

Remember that managing libraries effectively can help you keep your projects organized, and make it easier to find and work with your media files. Each library contains all of the media, edits, and other work associated with a project or a group of projects, so it's important to give them clear, descriptive names that make it easy to tell what they contain.

### How do I customize the interface in Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro offers several ways to customize the interface to better suit your workflow. Here are some of the key ways you can customize the interface:

#### Workspaces

Final Cut Pro includes a number of pre-defined workspaces, which are layouts of the interface that are tailored to different types of tasks, like color grading, audio editing, and more. You can switch between these at any time by going to Window > Workspaces. You can also save your own custom workspaces by arranging the interface how you like, then going to Window > Workspaces > Save Workspace As.

#### Viewer & Timeline

You can adjust the size of the Viewer and the Timeline by dragging the border between them. You can also adjust the size of the clips in the timeline by using the Clip Appearance button at the bottom right of the timeline.

#### Browser & Inspector

The Browser and Inspector can be shown or hidden depending on your needs. You can show or hide the Browser by pressing Command-1, and the Inspector by pressing Command-4. You can also adjust the size of these panels by dragging their borders.

#### Secondary Display

If you have a secondary display, you can use it to extend your workspace. Go to Window > Show in Secondary Display to select what you want to display on the second screen.

Remember, the best layout depends on your specific needs and workflow. Feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.
