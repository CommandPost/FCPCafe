### Transfer Toolbox

Transfer Toolbox allows you to convert Final Cut Pro (for Mac) libraries into Final Cut Pro (for iPad) projects!

You can now easily get from your Desktop to your iPad! Simply drag your existing Final Cut Pro library into the application's drop zone.

You should ensure your library only has a single event, and all project timecode starts at 00:00:00:00.

All Motion Content and Media should be contained within the Library.

If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.

Transfer Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or later.
