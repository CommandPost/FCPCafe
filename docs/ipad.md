### Transfer Toolbox

Transfer Toolbox allows you to convert Final Cut Pro (for Mac) libraries into Final Cut Pro (for iPad) projects!

You can now easily get from your Desktop to your iPad! Simply drag your existing Final Cut Pro library into the application's drop zone.

You should ensure your library only has a single event, and all project timecode starts at 00:00:00:00.

All Motion Content and Media should be contained within the Library.

If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.

Transfer Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or later.

### Using an iPad as A/V Output for Mac

You can absolutely use your iPad as an A/V Output for Final Cut Pro, however it requires some extra setup.

First you must install NDI Tools on your Mac by downloading [here](https://downloads.ndi.tv/Tools/NDIToolsInstaller.pkg){target="_blank"}.

Once you've installed and restarted your Mac, an NDI option will appear in your **A/V Output** settings in Final Cut Pro:

You can adjust the NDI video format and frame rate in System Preferences:

You can then install an app such as [NDI Monitor](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ndi-monitor/id1196221514){target="_blank"} on your iPad.

For best quality, it's important to enable **Hi-Res NDI** and **Retina Display** in the NDI Monitor settings in the Settings app.

You can now stream from your Mac to your iPad over NDI, just like a regular A/V Output device.

You can learn more about how to Play media on an external display in Final Cut Pro for Mac on the [Apple support site](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/final-cut-pro/vera5b0c804/mac){target="_blank"}.
