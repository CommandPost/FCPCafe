### Using an iPad as A/V Output for Mac

You can absolutely use your iPad as an A/V Output for Final Cut Pro, however it requires some extra setup.

First you must install NDI Tools on your Mac by downloading [here](https://downloads.ndi.tv/Tools/NDIToolsInstaller.pkg).

Once you've installed and restarted your Mac, an NDI option will appear in your **A/V Output** settings in Final Cut Pro:

You can adjust the NDI video format and frame rate in System Preferences:

You can then install an app such as [NDI Monitor](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/ndi-monitor/id1196221514) on your iPad.

For best quality, it's important to enable **Hi-Res NDI** and **Retina Display** in the NDI Monitor settings in the Settings app.

You can now stream from your Mac to your iPad over NDI, just like a regular A/V Output device.

You can learn more about how to Play media on an external display in Final Cut Pro for Mac on the [Apple support site](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/final-cut-pro/vera5b0c804/mac).
