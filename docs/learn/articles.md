# Articles

This section of the site is dedicated to linking to great external articles, as well as providing a space to write FCP Cafe specific articles.

There's also a massive collection of Final Cut Pro articles over at [macProVideo.com](https://macprovideo.com/articles/final-cut).

Richard Taylor also links to a lot of great articles on [FCPX.TV](https://fcpx.tv).

In the coming weeks we'll update this page with direct links to relevant and useful articles.

### fcp.co

fcp.co used to be the go to site for the Final Cut Pro community, but sadly it was shut down in 2023.

We are currently investigating ways to transfer the old case studies from the now retired fcp.co to FCP Cafe.

There's still a handful of a articles on the Internet Archive, for example:
