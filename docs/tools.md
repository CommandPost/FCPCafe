### Change List X

Finally, you reached picture lock and send the project off so the sound department can start work. Which they do. Except a week or two later, there’s just “a few minor changes when the director took another pass”…

And that’s where a Change List comes in. Because “Final” is never “Final” and “Locked” is regularly “Unlocked” again.

Change List X analyses two Final Cut Pro X Projects and produces a change list comparing the Primary Storylines of the two versions of the edit.

- The report lists the changes that need to be made to the initial cut to match the new edits, step by step
- The report can be created as a PDF, tab-separated text file, or both
- Report times can be shown as either Timecode, Feet+Frames or Frame Count
- Change List X can also create a change pull list (for new footage added to the timeline) and a change discard list (for footage that needs to be removed from the timeline)

What is a Change List and who uses them?

A Change List lists changes made between one edit and another version of the same edit. This comes into play when you’ve handed over the “Final” version to VFX, post audio and a color pass.

Inevitably there will need to be some additional edits, for whatever reason. Another pass by the Director, Studio suggestions, feedback from a focus group: it’s inevitable.

Except those teams have already moved ahead with their jobs and have complex projects built around the timing of the first edit. They can’t take the new edit and start over. What they need are the steps to convert the version they been working on, to the latest revision: how many frames trimmed here, or added there; which shots have been added, and which deleted or replaced.

The Change List is the step-by-step instructions to convert the current project to conform to the new edit. This is frequently a manual process but there are advanced tools that use the text-based change list to automate the changes.

### EDL-X

Create Edit Decision Lists - EDLs - from Final Cut Pro X XML files. The EDLs can conform to the CMX 3600 standard and can be used to bring your cut into post production systems like DaVinci Resolve, Smoke, as well as various non-linear editing systems.


EDL X features flexible Source Reel Name handling:

- Source names can be read from XML files, or directly from the QuickTime files used in the project.
- Alternatively, media file names, or full file paths can be used.
- Source names can be made to conform to strict CMX standards (three numbers), or 8, 16, 32 or unlimited alpha-numerical characters.
- All source names are user-editable, on a per-source basis.

Roles can be used to filter the clips reflected in the EDL.

Metadata associated with the footage - or added in FCP X - can be shown in the EDL as comments. This is provides a way to pass ASC CDL values on to color grading.

EDL-X can be set up so that EDLs can be made directly from Final Cut Pro's Share menu.

The app can list effects including some parameters and keyframes.

EDL-X groups all video and audio clips into as few tracks as possible. Each video track gets its own EDL, with synch audio in the same EDL.

Drag and drop XML files to create EDLs, or drag projects directly out of FCP 10.3.

### Producer’s Best Friend

Eliminate Clip Reporting hell! Every Report you need from Final Cut Pro X, in a formatted spreadsheet with no EDL or copy and paste!

Producer’s Best Friend creates a formatted .xlsx spreadsheet report (for Numbers, Excel, Preview, etc.) about the video clips, audio clips, titles, generators, markers, keywords, effects and transitions in your timeline or event to help you make batch lists, cut lists and music cue sheets. Producer’s Best Friend reports on Clips in a Library, Event, Compound Clip or Project. The report includes sheets for:

- Summary (with missing media and generators)
- Clips (with optional thumbnails)
- Roles/Subroles (with optional thumbnails)
- Keywords
- Ratings
- Markers
- Titles & Generators
- Video & Audio Effects
- Transitions

Producer’s Best Friend takes the tedious work out of creating all kinds of clip usage reports. Report on clips in an Event (like Batch List in FCP7), clips in a Compound Clip or clips in a Project in an Excel spreadsheet in seconds. Why spend days doing a boring task when it can take minutes?

Producer’s Best Friend can generate music use reports as well as Video and Audio Effects, Roles and Subroles, Transitions and Markers directly to a fully formatted Excel spreadsheet, without the convoluted use of an EDL or copy/paste techniques.

You can choose which Roles to include in the report (Video, Titles, Dialogue, Music, Effects, and any roles and subroles you’ve created), and Preferences lets you choose whether times are displayed as seconds, frames, feet+frames or HH:MM:SS:FF timecode format.

**Producer’s Best Friend will get you home earlier by:**

- Speeding the reporting of clip usage for music reports, stock footage requests, effects used, markers and keywords with amazing flexibility. Reports are complete in seconds, not hours or days.
- Providing full control over the report: choose which roles/subroles are included.

**Producer’s Best Friend will save you money because:**

- Your clip reports are completed in seconds instead of hours or days.
- You have full control over the report: choose which Roles to include in the report(s) including Roles and Subroles you’ve created.
- Generate as many reports as you need: create a music usage report; create a report of every clip used in a Compound Clip or Project, or every clip in an Event; report stock footage used, to order the full resolution for online; list out all Effects, Transitions, Titles and Generators used to smooth online finishing (the Apple column shows whether it’s a standard effect or transition compared to one created by a third-party); report all the comments in your Markers.
- Generate one report for the whole timeline, or report role-by-role.

Reports can be further processed in your spreadsheet application for formatting and additional detail, if required.

**Clips and Roles/Subroles Reports**
- Video thumbnail; Role ▸ Subrole, Clip Name, Category (primary, secondary, connected); Enabled; Timeline In; Timeline Out; Clip Duration; Source In; Source Out; Source Duration; Markers; Keywords; Effects; Notes; Reel; Scene; Take; Camera Angle; Camera Name; Frame Rate/Sample Rate; Frame Size/Audio Config; Source File Path; then columns for clip metadata.

**Markers Report**
- Marker Name; Type (Standard, Incomplete to-do, Completed to-do, or Chapter); Notes; Timeline Position; Visible; Clip Name; and Role ▸ Subrole; Reel; Source In; Source Out; and Source Duration.


**Keywords and Ratings Reports:**
- Keyword; Notes; Timeline In; Timeline Out; Duration; Clip Name; and Role ▸ Subrole.

**Titles & Generators Report:**
- Name; Enabled; Apple (Apple vs third-party generators); Role ▸ Subrole; Timeline In; Timeline Out; Clip Duration; Font; and Title Text.


**Video & Audio Effects Report**
- Effect name; On/Off; Apple (Apple vs third-party effects); Clip Name; Role ▸ Subrole; Timeline In; Timeline Out; and Clip Duration.

**Transitions Report:**
- Transition name; Category; Apple (Apple vs third-party transitions); Timeline In; Timeline Out; and Duration.

### Sync-N-Link X

“AutoSync” for Final Cut Pro X: batch sync dual-system sound using jam-synced SMPTE/EBU timecode.

Eliminate the time-consuming chore of manually synchronizing dailies (a.k.a. rushes) by batch processing an Event of unsynchronized clips exported from Final Cut Pro X.

Sync-N-Link X looks for audio whose free-run Timecode matches a video clip’s Timecode (although a matching video and audio clip don’t have to start at the same time, have the same duration, or even have the same frame rate).

Sync-N-Link X uses content created dates to find video and audio that were recorded on the same day for syncing.

Choose whether the synchronized clips are named after the video or audio clips - the original video and audio clip names are available inside the synchronized clips.

Synchronized clips can contain more than one audio clip (for cases where audio recording was stop/started during a take).

Sync-N-Link X adds a "Synced" keyword for the video range (essentially trimming the clip to the video duration). Any unused video and audio clips are marked with a "Not Synced" keyword.

Sync-N-Link X assigns audio Subroles and component names to second-system audio tracks and camera audio, giving the user dynamic control over audio playback during editorial.

### Transfer Toolbox

Transfer Toolbox allows you to convert Final Cut Pro (for Mac) libraries into Final Cut Pro (for iPad) projects!

You can now easily get from your Desktop to your iPad! Simply drag your existing Final Cut Pro library into the application's drop zone.

You should ensure your library only has a single event, and all project timecode starts at 00:00:00:00.

All Motion Content and Media should be contained within the Library.

If you have custom fonts on the Mac Final Cut Pro library, you should manually install them on the iPad before importing the project.

Transfer Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or later.

### X2Pro

Move your Final Cut Pro X projects to the audio suite simply and quickly. X2Pro Audio Convert takes your FCP X XML and creates an AAF with embedded or referenced audio media which Avid Pro Tools can open as a session, delivering seamless integration between the two applications..

X2Pro Audio Convert is a cutting edge conversion application for delivering FCP X projects for audio finishing, it is easy to use directly from within FCP X.

Taking advantage of the innovative Roles features in FCP X, X2Pro allows you to choose how these are converted to tracks; their order, packing and whether they are included, allowing sound designers to start working immediately.

Media can be embedded in the AAF (and trimmed with handles to minimise file size) to create a single, simple to transfer, file. Alternatively the AAF can reference external media which is ideal when FCP X and ProTools have access to the same shared storage.

Those who do not need the advanced functions of referenced, trimmed media, or close control of the conversion of Roles, can look at the cost effective X2ProLE.

X2Pro faithfully translates your audio timeline along with L-cuts, J-cuts, transitions, levels, automatic gain and fade handles, as well as the incredibly powerful FCP X compound clips. Transitions are converted into linear cross fades. Audio media can be any QuickTime supported audio, non-PCM audio is converted to PCM at either 16 or 24 bit.

R3D media is supported.

Multicam Clips are effectively translated taking across the audio of the selected angle.

X2Pro gives a clear warning when it comes across elements of a sequence which it cannot translate such as time maps and effects.

We recommend rendering an off-line or proxy version of the flattened video and exporting that if a reference is needed within Pro Tools. Only audio media is translated by X2Pro.

Requirements

- FCP X, 10.0.4 or later and XML from 1.1
- X2Pro is tested on the latest release OS and the previous release
- Pro Tools v7.0 or later for AAF import (not LE versions, v7 and v8 require Digitranslator for AAF import)

X2Pro uses Marquis Media Highway technology to integrate FCP X into the established professional audio workflow. Marquis Media Highway is the core technology employed by Marquis’ media integration products – it improves how broadcast production systems interoperate by delivering a seamless and cost-effective integration between leading broadcast content applications. Marquis Broadcast specializes in content workflows and media integration software and has been delivering solutions to broadcast since 1998.

### Xsend Motion

The missing piece between Final Cut Pro and Motion 5: Xsend Motion from Automatic Duck.

Xsend Motion converts your FCP timeline into a Motion project in just seconds, translating Transforms like Position and Scale, Opacity and blending modes, titles and many third party effects as well.

A new Motion project is created referencing the same media files used by Final Cut Pro, no new media is created. You can easily adjust your footage in Motion, everything is live and not baked-in.

Uploaded by Automatic Duck on 2017-12-05.
You can send an entire project from FCP to Motion, or you can export the contents of a compound clip to XML and translate that into Motion. Your Motion work can be exported back to FCP as a QuickTime movie or published as a Generator. Any time you have a clip or set of clips in FCPX that want to use in Motion, Xsend Motion is the tool you need to send those projects across.

Xsend Motion integrates with the Final Cut Pro Share menu as well as with XML exports from FCP 10.2.1 and later, including Final Cut Pro X 10.6.
