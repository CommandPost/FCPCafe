FCP Cafe was thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite) at [LateNite Films](https://latenitefilms.com/technology/).

The origin story comes back to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569), where [Alex Gollner](https://twitter.com/Alex4D) tweeted that "fcp.co is no longer the Final Cut Pro watercoooler place", and Chris replied with "Screw it… I just registered [finalcutpro.tech](https://finalcutpro.tech). Let’s do this thing!".

Chris decided that FCP Cafe was a better name/domain, and as a result, this site was born.
