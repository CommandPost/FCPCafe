FCP Cafe was thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite) at [LateNite](https://latenitefilms.com).

The FCP Cafe **icon** was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](https://matthewskiles.com).

You can download a **Desktop Wallpaper** version of it [here](https://fcp.cafe/static/FCP-Cafe-Wallpaper.png).

The origin story comes back to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569), where [Alex Gollner](https://twitter.com/Alex4D) tweeted that "fcp.co is no longer the Final Cut Pro watercoooler place", and Chris replied with "Screw it… I just registered [finalcutpro.tech](https://finalcutpro.tech). Let’s do this thing!".

Chris decided that FCP Cafe was a better name/domain, and as a result, this site was born.

Since creating the site, [lots of people](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) have contributed!
