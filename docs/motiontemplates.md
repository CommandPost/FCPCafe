### Annotator

**Annotator** is a set of flexible animated tools to mark or highlight part of your video.

With Annotator, you can draw on a hand-made arrow to point at something, throw a dotted box around something else, or even zoom in to focus on a solid circle. Though fully customisable options are included, this is not just another callout pack — it includes unique, exclusive recordings of hand-drawn animated shapes for an organic feel. Every shape includes several different options so you can use a new variation every time. You’ll find these shapes perfect for educational or instructional videos, cooking videos, reviews, or any time you need your viewers to look at something specific.

First, you’ll pick a style that suits your project — synthetic generated options with full control over stroke with and other line properties, or organic hand-drawn options recorded from the movement of a real pen. Next, from your chosen style, you’ll pick a shape:

- Arrows to point at things.
- Circles, Ovals, Rectangles and Squares to draw attention to something.
- Lines to underline or highlight specific items and Zigzags to scribble items out. Zigzags are only available in the hand-made recorded styles.
- Checkmarks (aka “ticks”) and Crosses to mark things as good or bad.
- Zoom In, to magnify part of the image and optionally darken down everything else. Only available in the generated styles.

Every item here can be easily positioned, rotated and scaled using the on-screen controls. In the Inspector you can adjust many more properties about the shapes, like the color, the outline width, animation speed, and to change which organic recorded shape is shown. Dashed and Dotted styles include several relevant options so you can dial in the settings you want. Advanced controls let you add a drop shadow or a glow, or change the 3D rotation or anchor point.

All the shapes will work with any aspect ratio from vertical through ultra-wide.

### PiP Kit

**PiP Kit** is a Picture-in-Picture plug-in. It's packaged as Effects, not drop zones in generators or titles, so you can trim, roll, copy and paste effects, and save effects presets just as you can with any regular clip. To get started, just drag one of the effects to one of your clips, and start tweaking the settings.

As well as a solid border color, you can use a gradient or outline gradient. Position the outline centered on the edge, the inside or outside, or use the Outline Offset to make something original. Remove the border entirely or leave just a shadow with the Fade Outside slider.

You can scale a PiP up from nothing, at a choice of speeds (Fast, Medium, Slow), or scale down from a full-screen shot to reveal a clip underneath. PiP Kit also includes a special set of transitions that only affect the connected picture, ignoring the background.

To use these, turn off the built-in transitions by unchecking the Build In and Build Out, then look in the transitions browser to find funwithstuff PiP Kit. These transitions have to be applied to the correct “in” or “out” side of a clip to work properly, but they do allow you to customise the way a clip enters or leaves the frame.

PiP Kit also includes several adjustment layer titles that change everything below them, and uniquely, these adjustments fade in and out. You can use the Obscure effects to apply your choice of blur, gamma, brightness, vignette and crystallize, which fade in and out with controllable speeds. Use the fade or wipe variants just above your background clips to make your picture-in-picture clips really stand out.

The last adjustment layer enables a very popular trick: punching in and out smoothly. Add the Zoom in and Out title, trim it to where you want the zoom to happen, then customise the speed. Easy, and useful even if you’re not using a Picture in Picture effect.
