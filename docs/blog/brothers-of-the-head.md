# Brothers of the Head

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a great little fake English documentary about Siamese twins, who are groomed into becoming commercial rocks stars. The script is really well done, and you seriously feel like you are watching history – not fiction. All the acting is great, and each character is unique and fits the story perfectly. If you’re in the mood for watching a fake documentary, this is a great movie!
