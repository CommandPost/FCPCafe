# The Way I Spend the End of the World

This is a truly fantastic film about an attractive young woman called Eva that lives at her parent’s home with her brother and is coming to terms with adulthood and love. Eva blends the joys and confusions of growing up with the sadness and restriction of living in a country under brutal dictatorship (Romania). It’s a film that explores the feelings of everyday people in a time of disorder. The cast is truly magnificent – Eva and her young brother are the most lovable characters, who bring to the film a huge amount of hilarious moments. A truly beautiful movie.
