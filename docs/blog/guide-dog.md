# Guide Dog

This is a really funny short animation about an enthusiastic but unqualified dog that answers an advertisement for a guide dog position, but finds the task slightly more challenging than he could ever imagine. Nothing seems to go right for this poor dog! Again, this film shows that if you hurt a cute character, you are assured instant laughs!
