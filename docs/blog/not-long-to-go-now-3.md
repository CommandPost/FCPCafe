# Not long to go now…

**Written by Chris Hocking on 17th October 2010**

Yesterday was a BIG day! We bumped into the venue and set up all the streaming gear, and Al and Nick also did some rehearsals with the actors for the live event. We tested everything, and everything seemed to work – which was a great relief!

Not long to go now… Which is both exciting and scary! We still have a bit to work out, so I’m going to leave you there, and get back to it! See you tonight!
