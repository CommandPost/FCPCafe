# Smile! You’re on candid camera!

It’s extremely hard to believe it’s already been four days since I last updated this blog! Where the hell does time go? No really – I honestly want to know! So what’s been happening since my last message, well, quite a lot! Last Saturday we had more auditions – eighteen of them to be precise. Everything went smoothly, and there was some great talent in the mix! On Sunday we met up with Ben Hidalgo – our amazing DOP for the Sakooz project. We talked all things light, around a coffee table in Prahran, and started to put together a game plan for this epic adventure. Then on Monday is was back to uni, and a meeting with another Chris – an animatronics expert that studied at the VCA. After another discussion around the coffee table, and some more discussions and planning – we walked away a lot more confident than what we were on Friday. Everything seems to be heading in the right direction. Our DOP is the best (and I honestly mean it), so we have little to worry about in terms of that department. And now with another Chris on the team – we’ve got animatronics covered. So despite all odds – at the moment, we appear to be winning the war. Of course it’s still very early stages, and there are a lot more battles to go… Money is probably one of the biggest issues. Oh, if you’re rich, and have some cash to spare – then get in touch with us! Unfortunately, I’ve got to get back to work – but before I leave, here are some photos of our auditions:
