# A Man

This is a short Portuguese film about a drinking and smoking man who harasses a woman in his apartment. It was kind of entertaining to watch, as you didn’t know how aggressive this man would get, or whether maybe the woman was a “villain”, but the end was very anticlimactic. The production values were also relatively poor, with average lighting and average sound.
