# Punk’s Not Dead

This is a really well structured documentary, exploring the history of Punk over the last 30 years. Mixing interviews with video clips, and animations, this is a really good film that sheds some really interesting and cool facts on a world I’ve never had anything to do with. It had some really funny moments, but what made it so entertaining was that the pacing was so fast. You didn’t get a chance to even think about being bored, which is great. I really enjoyed this film.
