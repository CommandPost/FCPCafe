# Lost & Found

This is a strange collection of different stories, and funny sequences. It begins with a story of a wedding party that waits in suspense for the bride and groom. It then tells the story of a shy young girl (and her turkey) who travel to visit her sick mother in hospital in an attempt to convince the doctors to operate. Changing directions again, it then tells the story of two children who are born on the same day in the same city, but have no possibility of getting to know each other. As the film rolls on, more seemingly random stories are told. This is a really hard film to get your head around, as it just seems to be a collection of ideas thrown together. I can’t say I’m the biggest fan.
