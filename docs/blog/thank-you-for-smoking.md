# Thank You for Smoking

This film follows the life of tobacco industry lobbyist Nick Naylor, as he promotes and defends cigarette smoking in a time when the health hazards have become too plain to ignore. Nick, a master of manipulation, who has the skill and flair to convince anyone of anything, can talk his way out of any situation. Nick’s son Joey needs to understand and respect his fathers philosophy, and Nick works hard to respond to that need without compromising his lack of values. When a beautiful news reporter betrays Nick’s sexually-achieved trust, his world seems in danger of collapsing. But with the help of the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death – his equivalents in the firearms and alcohol industries), Nick takes on the big guns. This is a seriously funny film with truly amazing and side splitting dialog. Nick is such as loveable character despite the fact he’s working for an organisation that kills people to make a profit. It’s stylish, slick and fast paced, but best of all, every single line of dialog is perfection. I really loved this film.
