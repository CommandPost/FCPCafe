# Fast Lane

Fast Lane is a suburb Australian short film about a boy who returns home from a party one night clammy and pale. His mum knows that something is wrong, but Ash doesn’t want to reveal that he may have killed someone by throwing a rock onto a busy freeway. This is an excellent moving story about the relationship between two young teenage boys, and how they deal with growing up and what happens when they egg each other on to do stupid things. The acting is terrific, both by the two boys and by Ash’s mother. This is a really moving short film with a satisfying ending.
