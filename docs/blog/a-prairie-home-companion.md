# A Prairie Home Companion

This is a really bizarre and comical film about the last performance of a fictitious radio variety show; before a Texas Company turns the old theatre venue they use into a multi-story car park. Full of singing, dancing, seriously bizarre and eccentric characters, and even an Angle from above, this film is really entertaining. The radio show manager was hilarious, as were some of the less major characters, such as the sound effects man and the stage manager. It had an almost documentary feel to it, as all the characters felt so real and natural. The chemistry between all the characters is also really good. Despite the fact Iâ€™ve never been a big fan of musical films, I really like this one. It had loads of colour and beautiful camera work, and a killer soundtrack and musical score. Well worth watching.
