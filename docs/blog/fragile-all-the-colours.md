# Fragile – All The Colours

**Written by Chris Hocking on 18th February 2014**

Michael Shanks recently helped out on this beautiful music video for [All The Colours](http://allthecolours.bandcamp.com), directed and shot by our very good friend, [Edward Goldner](http://www.edwardgoldner.com/). It was colour graded by the amazingly talented CJ Dobson from [Pocket Post](http://www.pocket-post.com). Enjoy!
