# Clean Linen

A New Zealand film, Clean Linen is a peculiar film about two children who spend their days doing chores around the house and secretly watching their father’s pornography video collection. When they are caught by their mother, things are a bit heated in the house. Despite the fact that this was an interesting film to watch, I think I may have missed the point. I didn’t really get what the message behind the film was. None of the acting seemed that terrific, although there wasn’t much dialogue or action. The cinematography was noteworthy, with some very nice visuals of the house. Overall, this was a slightly entertaining piece – although not really my cup of tea.
