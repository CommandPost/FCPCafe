Half our world lies hidden in the depths of the ocean. [The Underwater Realm](http://theunderwaterrealm.com/) is a series of short films that chronicle five times throughout history when mankind has come into contact with an ancient race of people living beneath the sea.

The Underwater Realm is one of the most inspiring independent film projects of all time – so we’re so extremely proud to play a very, very, very [small role](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/realmpictures/explore-the-underwater-realm) in it’s creation… Enjoy!
