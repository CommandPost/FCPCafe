# 9 Square Metres for Two

This is a great experimental documentary, made up of a series of short clips filmed by actual inmates of Baumettes Prison in France. Basically, someone has given ten men a handheld video camera, some quick instructions on how to press record, and let the people do their thing. This is a really interesting film, as the characters are so interesting. However, it is what it is: a bunch of criminals with digital cameras.
