# Spider

Spider is an absolutely fantastic short film about Jack – a man who loves to play practical jokes on his girlfriend – and what happens when things don’t go exactly to plan. Opening with a quote, “it’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye – mum”, this film is a very simple idea, but executed brilliantly. It has several key moments where things just don’t happen as planed – leaving the audience in complete and utter shock. The events are so unpredictable and heart breaking, that they’re funny. The film looks great – despite the fact that most of it takes place in a single location – a car. The characters and acting are superb, especially the extras (specifically the two Indian men who work in the petrol station). This film has some fantastic visual effects, which look completely realistic. Overall, this is just a really entertaining film. A great concept that was filmed perfectly!
