# Unrequited Love

I really hated this film. It explores stalking, but it does so in a very unique and bizarre manner. Personally, I hated every thing about this film. It used a lot of video footage that was supposed to look like security camera footage. This gave the film a very cheap documentary feel to it. It also had a very school essay type feeling, as the two voice over’s spoke in a very unnatural book-like educated manner and tone. I didn’t really understand what was happening a lot of the time, as I tended to zone out, due to sheer boredom. This is just one of those films, that I fell doesn’t work. It seems very experimental. Unfortunately, this experiment failed miserably.
