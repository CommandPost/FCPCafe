# The Nine Lives of Korean Cinema

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a broad documentary that explains the history of Korean Cinema. It tells the story of the countries cinematic history and shows interviews of artists who express their concerns, fears and aspirations. The production values were fairly average (with some really amateur sound), but the content was quite interesting for me, as I know very little about Korean Cinema. Worth watching, but it could have been made so much better.
