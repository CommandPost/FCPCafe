# Paper and Sand

This is a film about a foreign couple who move to a Sydney beachside apartment to start a new life. However, their expectations and experiences of Australian urban life create a conflict between them. The characters in the film were great; very real. The story was good and kept you interested. The production values were good, with nice clean sound and fairly good looking camera work. Overall, this is a very nice short film.
