# From Gold to Grapes: The Story of Landsborough

This is a short film made up of local children’s drawings turned into animations and local adults voice over’s, that tell the tale of living in Landsborough. Although it offered some laughs, this concept has been done to death (using kid’s drawings and adult voices), so it didn’t really grab me. Although it was slightly entertaining, it was nothing special.
