# The Dance

This is very powerful Australian short film that gives a brief insight into the life of a seemingly depressed and troubled teenager in a typical suburban setting. Visually it’s most impressive, despite the obvious low budget, with some fantastic night footage. I’m a big fan of the use of red light to highlight the freeways and party scenes. The soundtrack was great; I especially liked the sound used in the party scene, when the main character starts to drift off into another world. The music was really nice as well. I’m a big fan of the punchy acoustic steel string guitar sound. Overall, I was really impressed with the film.
