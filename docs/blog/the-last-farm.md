# The Last Farm

This is a quite powerful short film about an elderly man who has lost his wife, and is about to loose his farm, independence and his dignity. In desperation, he finds a way to keep it all. The look of this film is quite beautiful, set in a wonderful remote snow covered landscape by the ocean. But, although the main character does a fantastic job, and you really do feel his pain, his actions and the story in general is very predicable. However, it doesnâ€™t really matter. Predicable or not, the film gets it point across and brings a tear to your eye.
