# Raul the Terrible

This is an amazing insightful documentary that takes an extremely close look into the world of Raul Castells, an Argentinean man who is fighting for the rights of the poor people in his country. You are right there with him, as he organises peaceful and non-violent protests against the corrupt government. Raul is non-religious, big and loud, walking, talking, yelling, screaming machine that devotes all his energy and power to his beliefs. He would die for the good of the people that support him â€“ and this film proves it. This film really takes you on a journey, and helps you understand what this country is going through. It has some amazing footage and has been edited together perfectly. This is a very inspiring film.
