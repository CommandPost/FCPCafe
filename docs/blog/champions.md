# Champions

This is unique film about three dysfunctional men, who decide to leave their troubled city lives, and head out to the country to work on a farm, run by one of the men’s eccentric uncle. All the characters in this film are fantastic, from the crazy local cop to the attractive girl next door. What I love about this film is you’re never quite sure we’re its headed. The pacing is quite slow for the majority of the movie; however there is always this underlying tension, where drama threatens to take place. There are some seriously funny moments throughout the film and some very nutty conversations between the three confused and unconventional main characters, and the army-trained uncle. This is a very strange film, but it’s very entertaining, and well worth watching.
