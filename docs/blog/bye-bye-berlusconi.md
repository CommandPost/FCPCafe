# Bye Bye Berlusconi

This is a great fake documentary, about a group of people who make a fictional film about a terrorist cell that captures infamous former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. It mixes footage of the making of the fictional no budget film shoot (as the character are harassed by the authorities), with footage of a finished product (basically a film-within-a-film). This is a really gutsy and intelligent film, of which I have a lot of respect for. I can only imagine, actually making this film (the one I saw), was just as hard as what, as I viewer, I witnessed of the characters making the film. Despite the fact that it was constantly going from fictional “real life” to the actual film content, the movie was easy to follow. The characters were great, and the look of the film suited the style. But what made this film special is that the script/story is unique. It’s a really bold statement about the freedom of speech, which has been made tremendously well…
