# A Few Old Blokes

This is a short Australian documentary that focuses on the stories from a group of “old blokes” that live in a public high-rise building. The occupants tell us about their daily routines, their past and dreams. And that’s basically it. The filmmaker got a camera and filmed a group of old people as she asked some rather random questions. To me, I found this film to be a lazy attempt of a documentary. The photography was average, and the sound quality was pretty ordinary. Even though the characters in the film were very interesting people, it seemed as if they weren’t being fed the right questions to spark up exciting conversation. Although there were some funny moments, and it did give an insight into a world I’m unfamiliar of, I think it could have been pulled off a million times better. I wasn’t impressed with this film.
