# The Wraith of Cobble Hill

This is an impressive animation about a Brooklyn teenager who is asked to look after a local store ownerâ€™s dog whilst he goes on holiday. Although the film is rather dark and depressing, the look of the film is quite incredible and overall it displays a powerful, yet tragic story.
