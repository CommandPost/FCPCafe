# Anne & Richard

This is a short film based on Shakespeare’s Richard III, but set in present day Melbourne that explores the relationship between to people, murder, betrayal, emotional turmoil and seduction. To be perfectly honest, I can’t really remember if I found this film to be of really high production value or really low. Never-the-less, it was very Shakespeare, and seems to fit together fine. It’s not my sort of film though.
