This is a film about a young man who travels with his mother to a shopping centre after a really big night of heavy drinking. Whilst driving along, we watch and observe some really uncomfortable and depressing conversations between the two. This is a really simple film, that is mostly driven by powerful dialog, although the opening scene is quite dramatic as the man returns home really, really drunk and without a key. It’s a short film that basically shows a unique insight into a troubled man’s life. I’m not quite sure if I liked it or not.
