# Transformers: The Art of Circuit Bending

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

Although, I love the idea of this movie (documenting a group of people who mess with electronics to make “cool” sound effects), the filmmakers just didn’t pull it off. The quality of the footage was poor, as was the sound. I also really hated the animations/title sequence that was used. This is a great example where a good idea has been ruined by poor production values.
