# Small Boxes

This is a really great short film about a young Latino-Australian man, who lives with his loving mother and grandmother at home and works night shifts at a produce market. He decides one day that he’s sick of his current job, and wants to apply for a job at a shoe shop. This film basically explores the struggle to even get to the point of an interview. It’s so great to see a financially struggling family work together and think outside the box. This film also focuses on the courage needed to turn ones life around. Visually, this short was very well filmed, with an appropriate soundtrack and score. It tells a very basic story, and thanks to a strong yet small cast, does it very effectively.
