# Here Be Dragons

**Written by Chris Hocking on 22nd August 2014**

On 19 July 2014, [Inspiration Rentals](http://www.inspirationrentals.com.au) screened three short films commissioned to show off the brand new Dragon camera from [Red Digital Cinema](http://red.com). We were very fortunate to be given the opportunity to create one of those short films!

The short film we made, Palindromes is currently commencing a film festival circuit, so we canâ€™t share it online quite yet, but in the meantime you can read about the event [here](https://medium.com/@cailyoung/here-be-dragons-65ab99cb6f1c), and watch a recording of the event above. Enjoy!
