# Importing AVCHD Footage into Avid

**Written by Chris Hocking on 13th April 2013**

We have thrown together a quick little PDF tutorial on how to import **AVCHD** footage (specifically footage from a **Sony NX5**) into **Avid Media Composer 6.5** using AMA. This tutorial assumes you are a beginner to Avid Media Composer, so it goes through all the steps in quite a bit of detail.

**You can download the PDF [here](./../documents/04-Importing-AVCHD-Footage-into-Avid.pdf).**

For more detailed technical information, it’s also worth checking out Avid’s [AVCHD AMA Plug-in Guide](http://resources.avid.com/SupportFiles/attach/AVCHD_AMA_v6.0_v10.pdf).

If you’re doing a more traditional offline/online workflow, then it’s worth checking out this video:
