# Mr Schwartz, Mr Hazen and Mr Horlocker

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a contemporary fable on the butterfly effect, the stress of apartment living and the challenges of modern policing. I wasnâ€™t a fan of this animation as I found it technically poor, and lacking of a good storyline.
