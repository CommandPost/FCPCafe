# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

Here is a quick little video of the snow that decided to invade us whilst we were building the Sakooz spaceship set. It was freezing!

Weâ€™ll be posting lots more videos and photos over the coming days and weeks, so make sure you keep an eye out on this blog!
