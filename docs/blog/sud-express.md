# Sud Express

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a slightly boring film about six ordinary people whose lives are affected by their journeys on the Sud Express. Although all the character were unique and quite interesting (a racist taxi driver, his unfaithful wife, two old men who didn’t walk to one another, a African migrant who tries to find a life elsewhere, another migrant who goes hunting for a lost lover, a guy in a wheelchair and his best friend), I think I’m just over stories that lack a beginning and an end. The highlight of this movie for me was the non-human actor in the film, a lovable dog that narrowly escapes death by owner. This wasn’t a beautiful film, nor was it exciting. It was basically a look into a city from the viewpoints of several interconnected characters. Nothing special.
