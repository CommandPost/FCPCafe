# Fran-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-toc… And so the count down begins.

Greetings to all of our droogies (or SHOTGUNIES as we have now coined you all), closely following the every which move of the party here at LateNite. This past week has proved to be quite a busy one, and I’ve come here to show you the way of the future… IN the midst of all of our organization, shot listing, scheduling & the butchering of my baby (script… SCRIPT. Not an actual baby. You can’t take me to court), as you may well be aware, we have taken it upon our handsome selves to organise a LIVE SCRIPT READ.

“Oh hoorah, Al, another event that we can’t come to. Another ‘industry’ thing, that only cool people can come to” I hear you sarcastically profess in my general direction. True though that may be, there is a something that we’re brewing, something very exciting.

We’d like to cordially invite you to join our script read, through the wonder that is modern technology. If you visit <http://live.latenitefilms.com> at 6pm on Sunday October 17th, then you too can join in, you can watch the read LIVE or just listen to it LIVE. Either way, it’ll be beamed LIVE & direct from the studio to your Mac (I can only assume at this point that you are cool, & therefore a Mac kid). This is one mother fucking exciting prospect! GET ON BOARD!!!

We’ve organized a fantastic ensemble of actors to perform the read & we’re going to stretch it as far as we possibly can. So open up your iCal, enter in the 17th of October, then sync it to your iPhone & set a reminder for 530pm. But I should warn you, for those that don’t like spoilers… This will effectively give you the film in audio form, so if you don’t want to know what happens, I might suggest you take a pass on this – as far as I’m concerned – ground breaking, world’s first, once in a lifetime event!

In other news, I got a hair cut & shaved.

Stay tuned… This is gonna get HOT!

AL.
