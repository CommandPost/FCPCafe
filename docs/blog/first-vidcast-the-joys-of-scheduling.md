# First Vidcast – The Joys of Scheduling

At long last, we finally got around to putting together our very first video blog! We have to be honest – the camera work is pretty awful, as is the audio, and we did notice those little lines at the start of the video… however! The important thing is that we got it out there to you, and you can be rest assured that we’re spending all our time and energy on getting the feature film up and running! That said though, we have certainly already learned from our mistakes, so episode two will certainly be a lot slicker… Stay tuned!

Onward & Upward!
