# New Logo!

As I’m sure you’ve noticed by now, we’ve recently got ourselves a new SHOTGUN! logo – which is VERY exciting!

It was designed by the extremely talented [René Ellis](http://www.reneellis.co.uk/ "Rene Ellis"), who also designed the current LateNite Films logo, and we must say, we cannot recommend René highly enough! She is an absolute pleasure to work with, and really spends a lot of time with us to really get the logo exactly right.

We hope you like the new design as much as us!

Onward & Upward!
