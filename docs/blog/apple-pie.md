# Apple Pie

A tale of a butcher, a baker, a hunter, a dog, a cat, an apple pie and a series of misunderstandings and unfortunate events! This is a funny little animation that doesn’t have any dialog. The colours and look of the film are great – very bold and modern. Although the story is a bit hard to follow straight away, it proves to be a great little screenplay!
