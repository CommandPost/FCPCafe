# The Signal

This is a very low budget independent film – but in the best possible way. Full of blood and guts – this is a film, split into three parts by three different filmmakers, about a mysterious signal that gets sent out around an American city, taking over every electronic device, and wreaking psychological pandemonium. All of a sudden, the signal turns normal people into homicidal maniacs. Amongst all the mayhem is a woman that is cheating on her husband. As people are killing each other left, right and centre, a three way relationship is battling out till the death. I’m not normally a fan of horror films – nor am I a fan of blood in any shape or form. However, this is a really entertaining film. It starts off looking as if it’s going to be absolutely terrifying. I was honestly thinking that I was going to freak out catching the train home alone late at night. However, as the movie progressed, the gore factor rose, but with it, so did the humour. The horrific events that took place, where just so outrageous and surreal, that you couldn’t help but laugh. Maybe it was laughing in fear – but it was laughing never-the-less. This wasn’t your traditional zombie comedy, nor was it an apocalyptic horror film – it was in a league of its own. The special effects were crud – but effective. There were plenty of moments that made you jump – and lots of movements where I was forced to look away in disgust. Overall, this was an entertaining film. I didn’t leave the theatre looking over my shoulder, which was a good thing. The film messed around with time as well, turning back on itself, and also played around with what is real, and what is in the mind. I don’t think I’d watch it again any time soon – but I’m glad I’ve seen it once.
