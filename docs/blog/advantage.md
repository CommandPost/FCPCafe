# Advantage

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2007**

This is a truly fantastic short film about a man and women who stumble home drunk, after an obviously fun and alcohol filled night. Everything is going to plan for the two, as they enter an unlocked tennis court (after taking of their shoes as per the sign) and start making out passionately, until the lights turn on and all hell brakes loose. This film has a killer punch line and a completely unpredictable little twist. The sound design and musical score is fantastic – and is absolutely terrifying in sections. The acting is fantastic – you really love these characters even though this is a short film. The script and concept, although simple, is extremely effective. The visual effects are terrific, and are another stand out of the film. Overall, this is an amazingly faultless film and is truly entertaining.
