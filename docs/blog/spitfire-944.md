# Spitfire 944

This is a fantastic moving and revealing glimpse into history, as an 83-year-old World War II pilot views 16mm film footage of his 1943 Spitfire crash for the first time. I especially loved the introduction to this film, as the director explains how the whole story came about, with the help of animation/motion effects. This was a really high quality production, and really inspired me to make a good documentary this year.
