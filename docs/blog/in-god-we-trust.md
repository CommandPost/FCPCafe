# In God We Trust

As Robert stands in the middle of a street contemplating the text written on a coin, he is suddenly hit by a SUV and instantly killed. In the waiting room of the afterlife, Robert soon is told by a clerk that he’s destined for Hell. All the little bad things that Robert has done in life have added up and his “score” is not good enough for the likes of heaven. When the clerk’s Windows computer crashes, Robert makes a quick getaway, and returns back on earth. He then foils a robbery, visits his girlfriend, dances and drinks a smoothie with his dad. His score rises with each good deed – but the afterlife authorities are on hot pursuit. This is an extremely funny film with great production values. It has a very “Run Lola Run” style to it as Robert races around just to stay alive.
