# We the Living

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a very well made New Zealand short film about a young woman who stumbles across a man that has hung himself just outside of the campsite she is staying at. Completely overwhelmed, she visits a young male friend who is also camping at the same site. In the safety of his tent, he shares a story of his past, which puts the girls own feelings sharply into focus. Like the New Zealand short, “Nature’s Way”, the production values of this short are truly fantastic. The images and sounds perfectly capture the beautiful New Zealand landscape. It’s kind of depressing however, that both these shorts focus on death. I didn’t really like the concept, after watching the complete film, however it was very captivating and the acting was very impressive. Overall, this was a nice short film.
