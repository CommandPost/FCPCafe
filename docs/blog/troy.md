# Troy

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a really eye opening and interesting documentary about a man called Troy Davies, an intense and passionate artist. He’s an anarchist with a vibrant and colourful life as a man, a women, performer, and musician, owner of a fashion label, a prostitute, and a person living with AIDS. He’s basically just a really amazing, and slightly insane person, who comes up great on film!
