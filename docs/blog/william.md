This is a great little film about an Indigenous magician, who gets locked up for a crime he didn’t commit, after encountering an unwelcome passenger on a taxi ride home. This is a truly moving film that explores race, magic and memory. I was really impressed with this film. Unlike a lot of Aussie shorts, this film looked amazing, sounded great, had fantastic actors, and most importantly a well written and developed script. Not many shorts I’ve seen achieve success in all departments! The colours in the film were really inspiring. I loved the red lighting used to light up the trees and pub. This film really has everything going for it.
