# Small Station

This is a cute little film about a mother and her intellectually handicapped son, who visit a remote regional train station, so that they can sit around and watch the express trains zoom by. Despite the boring story line, the photography is amazing, with beautiful shots of the lush forest landscapes. This film has a lot of fantastic dolly and crane shots. The soundtrack is also subtle yet very effective.
