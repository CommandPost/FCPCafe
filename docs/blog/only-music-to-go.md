# Only Music To Go!

It’s official! All the pictures elements are all done. It certainly wasn’t easy – and there has been a lot of brain numbing rotoscoping the last few weeks, but all the effects are done, the grade is complete and everything is ready and waiting for the final soundtrack to be attached. These are certainly exciting times! It just amazing how much time, effort and energy goes into a tiny little three minute trailer. But from all accounts, it’s certainly been worth it. The footage looks incredible, and the effects (despite being made on a shoe string budget) don’t come up too badly. Now all we have to hope is that when people actually watch the trailer, it makes them want to see the feature length film! Only time will tell…
