# Happy Festivus & Thanks for All the Fish!

It’s amazing to think that Christmas Day has already been and gone. This year has gone so incredibly fast it’s just not funny! On behalf of everyone at latenite films, I just want to wish you all a very merry holiday period, and an extra special New Years Eve! Thanks to everyone who has helped in any way, shape or form with Sakooz this year – and a big thank you to all of our regular blog readers! I really appreciate all your kind e-mails, comments, and suggestions! It’s so nice to think that at least three or four people are actually reading this thing! Your continued assistance and support will certainly will not be forgotten!

On another note, originally we were planning to release Sakooz to the Internet community on the first day of 2009. However, we have since decided against this for a couple of reasons. The main reason for the delay is that we want to get the “trailer remix” function (a website which allows you to edit together your very own version of the Sakooz trailer and share it with the world) up-and-running from the very get-go. When we release the Sakooz trailer to the world, we want it to land with a bang – so as much as we’re so eager and excited to let it out of its cage, we need to contain ourselves, take a deep breathe, and release it at the RIGHT time, with everything ready to go. So for those that haven’t seen it yet – unfortunately you’re going to have to wait just a little bit longer.

Well… that’s all for now. Again, a MASSIVE thank you to EVERYONE that has supported us in 2008! We certainly can’t wait to see what fun and adventures lies for 2009… *Exciting times certainly lay ahead!*

Merry Christmas! Happy [Festivus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus "Festivus")! Have a great holiday break and we’ll catch you again in 2009!

Chris!
