# I Saw Ben Barka Get Killed

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

I’ll start off by saying I wasn’t really a fan of this movie. I just couldn’t be bothered trying to keep up with it – I just found it boring. It’s basically a film about an ex-criminal who receives a strange commission from an illegal organisation to produce a documentary about decolonisation. I guess I just found this movie to be too old fashion, with its cool tone (verging on stagnant) and vintage soundtrack. I couldn’t relate or connect with the characters, nor did I care about any of them. I found the story too slow and it seemed to go off on random directions. I didn’t like the voice over narration either. Basically, I just didn’t like the movie at all.
