# My Brother Vinnie

This is a really magnificent observational documentary that explores the close relationship between two brothers. It crosses all cultural boundaries, capturing a loving relationship full of humour, wit and positive energy, whilst examining social issues, and Indigenous families. Although it has a very low-budget documentary feel to it, the people and content within the film is so attention-grabbing and fascinating, that you donâ€™t even notice. This is a short film that will make you laugh, and even bring a tear to your eye. But at the end of it, you leave with a smile.
