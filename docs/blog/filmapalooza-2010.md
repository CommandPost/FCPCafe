# Filmapalooza 2010

![](/static/blog/2011-03-48hourfilmproject_ticket-441x329.jpg "48hourfilmproject_ticket")

Last night was the official awards night for the [48 Hour Film Project International Competition](http://www.48hourfilm.com/filmapalooza/ "48 Hour Film Project") – strangely named *Filmapalooza –* in which our film, [Fallout](./../projects/fallout/ "Fallout") was competing. Although we didn’t exactly have the most enjoyable experience on the night, as both our film and ironically the Sydney team’s film experienced several technical hiccups and false starts (which was slightly nerve-racking as you can imagine!) – both films *eventually* screened perfectly in front of a very excited and packed audience at the final awards screening. It was great to be amongst so many talented like-minded film-makers! There were so many amazing films on display, from cities all over the world.

Unfortunately we didn’t pick up any International awards at the competition – but it was definitely worth the long trip, as we had such a fantastic time at the [Miami International Film Festival](http://www.miamifilmfestival.com/ "Miami International Film Festival"). A massive thank you to Danette Wolpert, Carol Coombes and the rest of the festival team for making our stay so enjoyable! We have seen so many fantastic films over the last few weeks (as documented on this blog), and have met with so many talented film-makers and industry supporters. If you ever get a chance to come along to the festival – we HIGHLY recommend it. Miami is a great city, and we have made a lot of friends here, which is really what it’s all about. We even had the pleasure of talking at the [Miami Dade College](http://www.mdc.edu/main/ "Miami Dade College"), about independent film-making in Australia which was a lot of fun. Thank you to Student Government President, Jennifer Sotolongo for organising the talk.

We would also like to offer a massive congratulations to our friends, Tim, Joseph and the rest of the London team for their incredible film, “The Girl Is Mime”. Staring the amazing UK screen legend, [Martin Freeman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293509/ "IMDB") – the film both looked beautiful and was hilariously funny. It also couldn’t have been won by a nicer bunch of guys! We highly recommend that you check out their [behind the scenes video](http://vimeo.com/19741170 "Behind the Scenes of The Girl Is Mime") and [photo gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/photocritic/sets/72157625265415698/ "Photo Gallery"). I’m sure we’ll be seeing a lot more “Far From Home Films” in the future, after they showcase their film at Cannes later in the year. Make sure you support their film if you come across it!

Also, well done to the runners up from the LA team for their film “Casting Call” and the Denver team for their film “46 Miles”.

We would also like to single out some great films that didn’t make the official top list – we were massive fans of the Albuquerque film “Camber Number 6”, the Granada entry [Granagedon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydJC3oKWmBo "YouTube") (which was hilarious!), the Miami film [Palindrome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N88wWvBOtr8 "YouTube"), the Utrecht entry [Onder Water](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4YM1-onuPc&feature=related "YouTube") and the Pittsburgh film [Ali\_N vs Predator](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOrvVfxWzO0 "YouTube"). Well done to all the members of their teams, and also to everyone else who made the effort to travel to Miami for the competition!

Thank you to everyone who has supported us over the last few months – and helped us raise enough money to get over to Miami to support our film. Although we’re not coming back with any big awards in our suitcases (apart from the Melbourne trophy), we now have a really good idea of what the competition is like on an International level, and will continue to push the boundaries when we compete again later this year in the [2011 competition](http://www.48melbourne.com.au/2010/index.php "48 Hour Film Project Melbourne"). Onwards and upwards, as they say!
