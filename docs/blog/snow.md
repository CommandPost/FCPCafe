# Snow

This is a really intriguing film about a father and son living in a remote snowing location. The son is doing some kind of weird experiment, burying rabbits in the snow. Despite the fact the footage originated from film, the quality was quite average and really grainy. The sound was fine; perfect realism. The story was interesting, although I still feel like I missed the point.
