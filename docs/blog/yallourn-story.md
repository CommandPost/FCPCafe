# Yallourn Story

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a really cute animation, about the memories of some old Yallournâ€™s residents, brought to life with illustrations drawn by primary school kids. Listening to the voice over is quite interesting, and mixed with the unique drawings gives you a very interesting little insight into the past of the old town.
