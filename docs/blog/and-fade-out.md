# And fade out…

Well, despite all odds, we did it! From all reports, for those in the live audience, and those watching at home, the live script read was a big success! Thank you so much to everyone who attended in person, and those that made use of the live stream via the Internet! An even bigger thank you to everyone who completed feedback forms, as this information will be a huge help in shaping the film into the type of movie YOU want to see!

We had a few minor technical difficulties at the start of the stream (mainly because we went live too early – we were supposed to only go live on the introduction video, but, oh well!), but once the read got started, everything settled down, and everyone who was watching seemed to be very happy and impressed!

We will be posting highlights of the read online over the next couple of weeks! We will also be putting up heaps of photos and other behind the scenes videos!

And for those that didn’t notice, we have another behind the scenes feature online RIGHT NOW! Check out:

Nicole will be posting plenty of videos over the coming weeks and months, so stay tuned! Plenty of exciting content in the pipeline!

And for now… I’m off to bed! It’s been a long couple of days, and I need to get up in a couple of hours to return gear!

Onwards & Upwards!

Chris!
