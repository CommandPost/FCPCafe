# So many things to do!

The last couple of weeks have been hectic, but unfortunately it’s been mainly projects outside of latenite. I’ve personally been interstate working on various live shows, and have also recently start working full time for a post house in Melbourne on top of lots of other ventures, so the Sakooz site has been put on another temporary hold, which is a bit of a pain. As much as I would love to have it all done by the end of this month (and to be honest, it’s VERY close to being finished), I just don’t think it’s going to happen – especially with the [bushfires](http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/755947/fire-may-threaten-melbourne-homes-cfa "Bushfire destroys outer Melbourne home") that keep creping up on us! Therefore, we will be postponing the launch till April just to be on the safe side.

The good news is that we have been working closely with the team from [Kaltura](http://www.kaltura.com "Kaltura"), and the online trailer remix function has turned out great! Thanks to everyone who has been helping us with that element of the site!

Also good news is that our last blog entry has been getting a great amount of hits! Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read it, and also for sending us comments via twitter, Facebook and e-mail. It’s always nice to know that people are actually reading this blog! We recently been slowly getting more followers on twitter which is always nice!

And that’s about it for today! Don’t despair however, despite all these other commitments, the cogs are definitely still turning here… Nick has been working hard on several exciting initiatives, and we’re also starting to put together several teams of other people to begin work on some other new and exciting projects that we haven’t yet talked about. So stay tuned! This is going to be an very cool year…
