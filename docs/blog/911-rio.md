# 911 Rio

This is an experimental film that shows a whole heap of seemingly random images and sounds. I really like the look and feel of this film. The images looked fantastic and really kept you interested making you want to watch more. I especially loved the out of focus streams of coloured light. But what I loved most was the truly unique soundtrack. It used a whole heap of sounds from various locations to achieve a mood which suited the images â€“ and it worked really well.
