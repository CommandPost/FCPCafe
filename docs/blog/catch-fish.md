# catch fish

This is a film about a reclusive Chinese harp player who purchases a dead fish from a sexy lady at a seafood market, places it in his bath and lets his imagination run wild. This is a typical VCA film – very arty, with a rather unclear message. The cinematography and sound design are good – although they are pretty much like every other VCA film of this variety. To be perfectly honest, I don’t like this type of film. It’s just all a bit too weird for me.
