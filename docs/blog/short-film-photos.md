# Photos from the Short Film

If we step back in time to 2007, Alistair Marks was just your average film student studying towards a Bachelor of Film & Television at Swinburne University. However, unlike a lot of young up-and-coming filmmakers, he decided that instead of just putting together a short film that has a very limited chance of actually going somewhere, he would write a full length feature film script, and then film the opening sequence and submit it to festivals. As it turns out, Alistair was on the right track, as the script attracted a great collection of actors and crew, and put him in a great place to actually get the feature film from words on a page to big bangs on the big screen!

Here is a sneak peak behind the scenes on the short film shoot. Enjoy!
