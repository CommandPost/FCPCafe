# Shooting Dogs

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a film based on a true story of a Catholic priest and a young idealistic English teacher who found themselves caught up in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Filmed on location and employing actual survivors of the genocide, this is a deeply affecting and moving film that conveys a very important and powerful message. The cast is truly remarkable. As a viewer, you develop a huge attachment to all of the characters. The images are incredible, and although there are a lot of horribly graphic scenes, they needed to be included. Although you come out of the theatre feeling completely emotionally drained, it feels like a privilege to watch this film.
