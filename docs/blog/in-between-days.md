# In Between Days

This is a film about a Korean-born girl struggling through life with her mother in America – although, to be honest, I didn’t realise it was set in the US till after the movie! It explores the relationship between Aimie, and her only real friend, Tran. At first it seems Tran is looking to have a relationship with Aimie, but she’s not interested. But then it seems that Aimie has fallen in love with Tran, but he is more interested in another Korean girl. With no one to turn to, Aimie finds comfort in the memory of her father, whom she no longer has contact with. This is again, a really slow paced film, with an almost documentary feel to it. I didn’t really connect with the main characters, which meant I didn’t really care what happened to them. The photography and sound was very bland and boring, which suited the story. Overall, I found this movie a bit of a drag. I also hated the first scene, when Aimie gave Tran a “homemade” tattoo as I have a real phobia of needles.
