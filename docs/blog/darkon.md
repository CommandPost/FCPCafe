# Darkon

Darkon is a fascinating and intriguing documentary about an endearingly bizarre live action role-playing game, whose hundreds of members dress up as wizards and warriors, and engage in simulated, un-choreographed medieval battles with homemade padded weaponry. It gives you a fantastic insight into a world that most would never even dream of entering. It tells the story of people who use the game as a way of escaping their ordinary humdrum lives; to become heroes in their own make-believe world. This is an honest and seriously funny film, with stories and characters that absolutely glue you to the screen. Technically, the film is inspiring as well, with great dolly, crane and helicopter shots. I really loved this documentary, as it showed me a world that I never completely understood. I now know there is a unique group of people out there, which I never want to be associated with.
