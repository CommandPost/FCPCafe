# Sound of Noise

We didn’t really plan to go and see this film – we were supposed to head to another film on the other side of Miami, however the large taxi ride didn’t really seem that appealing. So instead, we decided to stay at the same theatre, and just see whatever was up next. I misread the program, and was expecting to see a depressing, but critically acclaimed South African movie. However, what we ended up seeing was a crazy musical masterpiece! This is probably one of the best films I’ve seen at the festival. The only problem was – within the first 20 minutes of the film, the movie stopped, the lights went up, the fire alarm went off, and we were forced to evacuate the building! Boy, oh boy! We haven’t had much luck this week with theatres! Luckily though, after the fire department did what they do, we got to go back in the theatre and watch the rest of the film. The only issue – we missed about 5 or 10 minutes! What a pain! Never-the-less, even taking to consideration the unexpected intermission, this was a very clever, and aurally epic film!

In this film, two classically trained, but rebellious and expelled musicians aim to do something completely out of the box. With the help of four crazy drummers, from all different walks of life, they attempt to perform their avant-garde masterpiece, “Music for One City and Six Drummers”. Divided into four very unique movements, they use all kinds of things (i.e. bulldozers, heart beat monitors, power lines and bank vaults) – to create really cool music. Tagged as the world’s first “musical terrorists” by the authorities, a tone deaf police detective, who’s a descendant of a distinguished musical family – but actually personally hates all form of music, is then set on a mission to track down these innovative, yet absolutely insane performers, after they kidnap a famous television journalist, and execute their first moment, “Doctor Doctor Gimme Gas (in my ass)”, by performing music on the patient after they forcefully put him to sleep, and dance around the operating theatre, under the observation of a closed-circuit security camera.

This is a seriously quirky film, with one of the best soundtracks I’ve come across in a long time. It has some really funny moments, and some scenes that just made everyone in the whole audience look at one another and go “what”? It’s intelligent, and just makes you want to tap your feet to the beat of the film. As the last film we got to see at the festival – it was great to end on such a high. I highly recommend you check this film out! Such a great film!
