## What is Superannuation?

Superannuation – more commonly known as just “super” – is essentially money that’s put aside and saved whilst you’re working, so that you can have a regular income when you retire.

It’s similar to a [managed fund](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/managed-funds) where your money is pooled with other members’ money and invested on your behalf by professional investment managers – so that your little [nest egg](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nest-egg) can grow bigger more quickly than if you just kept your money in a normal bank account gaining interest.

Most super funds offer a [variety of different investment options](https://www.mediasuper.com.au/super-account-information/investment-options). These usually include pre-mixed options that will contain a mix of different asset classes, and single sector options such as cash, property and shares.

Most super funds also offer [life insurance for their members](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/how-super-works/insurance-through-super).

To complicate things slightly, if you want even more control over your superannuation, you can setup a [self-managed super fund (SMSF)](https://www.ato.gov.au/Super/Self-managed-super-funds/).

There’s no fixed retirement age in Australia – but many people choose to retire when they become eligible for the Age Pension. As of June 2018, the current Age Pension age is 65 and this will rise in stages to 67 in July 2023. If current Government proposals are accepted, the Age Pension age will be [70 by 2035](https://www.humanservices.gov.au/organisations/about-us/budget/budget-2014-15/budget-measures/older-australians/increase-age-pension-qualifying-age-70-years). However, as of today, you can access your super [when you turn 65](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/accessing-your-super/) (even if you haven’t retired). On average, most Australian’s can expect around 20ish years of retirement – so by investing money in your superannuation fund, you’re basically (hopefully) putting a whole bunch of money aside, so that when you’re no longer working, you still have money coming in to do fun stuff. The more money you put away when you’re working, the more you’ll be able to spend in your retirement!

It’s your money, so once you’ve turned 65, you can choose to have a [regular super income stream](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Accessing-your-super/Super-withdrawal-options/) (basically, you just keep getting paid a wage, just like when you were working a normal job), you can combine your regular income stream with the [Government Pension](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/accessing-your-super/pensions-and-other-benefits/), or you can take out a lump sum if you’re really game (and make that feature film you always wanted to do as a youngster)!

There are also some very limited circumstances when you can [access your super early](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Accessing-your-super/Early-access-to-your-super/) – mainly related to specific medical conditions or severe financial hardship.

## How Do You Get Paid Super?

For most people, super begins when you start work and your employer starts paying super for you.

To [quote the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Working-out-if-you-have-to-pay-super/):

> You pay super no matter whether the employee:
>
> * is full-time, part-time or casual
> * receives a super pension or annuity while still working - including those who qualify for the transition-to-retirement measure
> * is a temporary resident - when they leave Australia, they can claim the payments you made through a ‘departing Australia superannuation payment’
> * is a company director
> * is a family member working in your business - provided they are eligible for SG.

At a very basic and fundamental level, if you work for a company or organisation (regardless of whether you’re part time, casual or even a contractor in **some** cases), are **over the age of 18** and **earning more than $450 gross a month**, then your employer **must** pay money into a super account in your name, which is then managed by a super fund of your choice (with [some exceptions](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/setting-up-super/offer-your-employees-a-choice-of-fund/) as some industrial awards specify a fund or a choice of a few funds that super **must** be paid into).

Superannuation should **never** be transferred from one back account to another – it needs to be processing through the proper superannuation channels (normally a [clearing house](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Paying-super-contributions/Small-Business-Superannuation-Clearing-House/)). You need to pay and report super **electronically** to ensure it meets [SuperStream](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/superstream/) requirements. Super guarantee payments must be made to complying funds or retirement savings accounts by the [quarterly due dates](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/paying-super-contributions/when-to-pay-super), which are 28 days after the end of each quarter. Some super funds require employers to make contributions monthly, and when you register with a fund with this requirement, you are agreeing to make monthly contributions to that fund.

Employees shouldn’t have to really think about the mechanics of how they get paid super – employers should just pay it, after receiving all the correct paperwork. However, employees should have a good understanding of how superannuation works, because it’s their life savings on the line!

The formula used is currently [9.5% of your income](https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?anchor=Superguaranteepercentage#Superguaranteepercentage), including bonuses, commissions and loadings. This is called the **Super Guarantee** and **it’s the law**.

To quote [Arts Law](https://www.artslaw.com.au/info-sheets/info-sheet/superannuation-and-contract-for-services):

> Under the SGC salary or wages have their ordinary meanings, and include payment to a person for work or services by the day, week or month; allowances (but excluding expense reimbursements and allowances and other payments which are fringe benefits); bonuses, commissions and ex gratia payments; overtime and penalty rates; annual leave, long service leave, sick leave and leave loading. Ordinary time earnings means earnings for ordinary hours of work and could include overtime, shift loading or commission.

The ATO has a [checklist](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/How-much-to-pay/Checklist--salary-or-wages-and-ordinary-time-earnings/) to help you identify what payments are considered salary or wages and whether they are considered part of ordinary time earnings (OTE) for super guarantee purposes.

It’s slightly confusing, but when talking about **casual workers** – the Super guarantee is currently calculated at 9.5% of a casual employee’s **ordinary time earnings**. This includes their wage plus any casual or shift loadings for ordinary hours of work. It also includes commissions and some allowances, but it **doesn’t include overtime payments**.

You can also [add extra money to your super account](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/Growing-your-super/Adding-to-my-super/Personal-super-contributions/), so that your future self has a better retirement. On that note, to [quote the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in-detail/growing/super-co-contribution/):

> If you’re a low or middle-income earner and make personal (after-tax) contributions to your super fund, the government also makes a contribution (called a co-contribution) up to a maximum amount of $500.

Your super is your savings for retirement. It is important to be aware of what super accounts you have, how much is being contributed, and what insurance they provide. You can use the [myGov service to consolidate superannuation funds](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/keeping-track-and-lost-super/consolidating-super-funds) – as ideally you only want a single super fund, to keep fees to a minimum.

## The Super Dilema

In theory – superannuation should be really simple, but there’s still a lot of confusion surrounding it – especially in the Film & Television world (although it also happens in [hospitality](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-18/hospitality-workers-chase-millions-in-unpaid-superannuation/9772546) & [construction](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/superannuation-bad-bosses-pocket-3-billion-of-your-super/news-story/fbc58516c6edd9ace9037b59cf7abbfb) too!), where a lot of people in the industry are freelancers and contractors. It’s also slightly more complicated than you might initially think as there’s some additional rules and clauses you need to take into consideration when using standard SPA/MEAA agreements for both cast and crew (explained below).

The [Tax Office estimated that in 2014-15](http://www.smh.com.au/money/super-and-funds/tax-office-reveals-size-of-underpayment-of-super-for-the-first-time-20170829-gy65t8/) there was a **$2.85 billion-a-year shortfall**, or a 5.2 per cent gap, in what employers should be paying their employees in super and what was paid.

To quote an [SBS article](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/government-cracks-down-on-employers-not-paying-super-for-workers):

> Federal Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer says employers deliberately not paying their workers’ super entitlements are “robbing” their staff of wages.

The ATO currently receives [20,000 reports of possible non-payment](https://www.myob.com/au/blog/2-85-billion-reasons-the-ato-is-looking-at-superannuation-payments/) from employees or former employees per year.

The government is so serious about solving this issue, that they have introduced a [new bill which threatens directors with jail-time](https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/superannuation/2018/03/29/government-moves-unpaid-super-new-laws-threatening-directors-jail/) if they don’t pay their employees super.

So what’s the problem exactly?

## Employee Vs Contractor

If you employ someone as [PAYG](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/PAYG-withholding/) (i.e. they get a payslip each pay cycle), and they’re **over 18** and earning **more than $450 gross a month**, then it’s pretty much a no-brainer – they’re an employee and [you have to pay them superannuation](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Working-out-if-you-have-to-pay-super/) – there’s no discussion or confusion.

The apparent confusion begins when someone is a freelancer or contractor, and is sending a company an invoice from their [Sole Trader](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Starting-your-own-business/Before-you-get-started/Choosing-your-business-structure/Sole-trader/) ABN.

The ATO also has another video discussing [“Employee vs Contractor – How to get it right”](http://tv.ato.gov.au/ato-tv/media?v=bd1bdiubfurqit).

To [quote the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Working-out-if-you-have-to-pay-super/Contractors/):

> Contractors paid mainly for their labour are employees for superannuation guarantee purposes. This is the case even if the contractor quotes an Australian Business Number (ABN).
>
> You must make super contributions for these individuals if you pay them:
>
> * under a verbal or written contract that is wholly or principally for their labour - that is, more than half the dollar value of the contract is for their labour
> * for their personal labour and skills - which may include physical labour, mental effort or artistic effort - and not to achieve a result
> * to perform the contract work personally - that is, they must not delegate.
>
> If you make a contract with someone other than the person who’ll actually provide the labour - for example, with a company, trust or a partnership - you don’t pay that person super.

The ATO has a [employee/contractor decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Employee-or-contractor/) and a [superannuation guarantee eligibility decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Super-guarantee-eligibility/) on their website.

The Australian Government also has an [Independent contractors decision tool](https://www.business.gov.au/Info/Plan-and-Start/Start-your-business/Independent-contractors/Independent-contractors-decision-tool) on their Business website.

Long story short, in MOST cases, if you’re employing a contractor that’s invoicing with a sole trader ABN, if they’re work is “wholly or principally for their labour” (i.e. a gaffer, grip, sound recordist, makeup artist, etc.), and the [employee/contractor decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Employee-or-contractor/) and [superannuation guarantee eligibility decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Super-guarantee-eligibility/) confirm your suspicions, then you should be paying them superannuation.

If you’re unsure, use the tools above, or better yet – [contact the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/About-us/Contact-us/) – they’re super friendly and super helpful.

The ATO are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ato_gov_au). They have a [Live Chat](https://www.ato.gov.au/About-ATO/About-us/Contact-us/Live-Chat/). They have hundreds of hours of content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AusTaxOffice). Even if you don’t like talking to people over the phone – there are plenty of ways to easily communicate with the ATO.

If you need superannuation advice from the ATO, I would suggest [completing this form](https://www.ato.gov.au/taxadvice/), so that their early engagement team can get back to you promptly.

## PTY LTD Companies

To [quote the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Employee-or-contractor/How-to-work-it-out--employee-or-contractor/):

> Companies, trusts and partnerships are always contractors. An employee must be a person. If you’ve hired a company, trust or partnership to do the work, then it is a contracting relationship for tax and super purposes. The people who actually do the work may be directors, partners or employees of the contractor but they’re not your employees.

This seems pretty straight forward, HOWEVER, if you use the [Employee/contractor decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Host/?anchor=ECDTSGET&anchor=ECDTSGET/questions/ECDT#ECDTSGET/questions/ECDT) and tick “A Company” in answer to “Who do you pay to do the work?”, and “Yes” for “Is the agreement between your business and the individual worker?” – then the decision tool will tell you that you do need to pay the worker superannuation. This is just plain confusing!

Although there are some [Employee or Contractor case studies](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Working-out-if-you-have-to-pay-super/Contractors/) on the ATO website, there’s nothing on there that’s specific to the Film & Television industry, so I contacted the ATO directly with a simple scenario:

> Let’s say I have a sound recordist in the Film & Television Industry. His name is Chris. He has his own PTY LTD company called Sound Company Pty Ltd. Production Company Pty Ltd would like to hire Chris for an upcoming television commercial. It’s a one off job, and he’s being paid a daily rate, plus equipment hire fees. Chris will invoice via his company, Sound Company Pty Ltd. Is Production Company Pty Ltd required to pay superannuation to Chris?

The ATO team were fantastic, and got back to me very quickly with a detailed reply. But before I share what they told me, here’s another disclaimer:

Long story short – if you employ a sound recordist (for example), that has their own PTY LTD company, then YOUR company is employing THEIR company, and THEIR company is responsible for any superannuation contributions to the sound recordist.

However, this means that if the same sound recordist invoiced via a Sole Trader ABN instead of via their PTY LTD company – they would get paid superannuation – meaning in the long term they get more money – so it’s reasonable and fair for PTY LTD companies to charge more money on their invoice to allow for this – but this is by commercial negotiation.

[The Australian Screen Editors](https://www.screeneditors.com.au) state on their [public rate card](https://www.screeneditors.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ASE-Rates-and-conditions_public_2017.pdf) that:

> For Pty Ltd Companies add an additional 17.5% - 30% depending on circumstances.

There’s also nothing stopping a sound recordist from doing PAYG for the labour, then invoicing from their PTY LTD company for any equipment.

[Freelance Promotions](http://www.freelancers.com.au), the go-to TVC crewing agency in Melbourne, note on their rate card that:

> Higher rates are usually charged by assistants who bill as P/L companies & cover super, insurance & workcover costs.

## Super For Film Crew

Most crew working in Film & Television will be working within the [Motion Picture Production Collective Agreement (MPPCA)](https://www.meaa.org/download/mppa-summary-2018/) and/or the [Broadcasting and Recorded Entertainment Award 2010 (BREA)](https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/documents/modern_awards/award/MA000091/default.htm).

The **MPPCA** states:

> **17. SUPERANNUATION**
>
> (a) In this clause:
>
> (i) “the Act” means the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992;
> (ii) “remuneration” means the employee’s gross agreed remuneration as defined in this Agreement;
> (iii) “quarter” means a period of 3 months beginning on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October. (iv) “contribution period” means the six-monthly period from 1 January to 30 June or 1 July to 31 December;
> (v) “maximum contribution assessment amount” shall be equal to the sum of twice the maximum contribution base calculated pursuant to the Act for any quarter;
> (vi) “the fund” means MEDIA Super, Australian Super, or any complying superannuation fund nominated by the employee and agreed by the Employer;
> (vii) “superannuation contributions” means payments made by the Employer calculated pursuant to sub-clauses (b) and (c) below.
>
> (b) In respect of each employee engaged under the terms of the Agreement, in addition to all other amounts payable under this Agreement the Employer shall pay into the employee’s account with the fund an additional amount equal to **9% of the employee’s remuneration** up to the maximum contribution assessment amount for the contribution period. (The maximum quarterly contribution base amount for the financial year 2009/2010 is $40,170 therefore the maximum contribution assessment amount for any contribution period for the financial year 2009/2010 is $80,340.)
>
> (c) **Superannuation contributions must be made on the basis of each employee’s remuneration regardless of any minimum threshold prescribed by the Act.**

> (d) Superannuation contributions must be paid into the fund each month.
>
> (e) It is the responsibility of the Employer to advise employees upon engagement of their entitlements in accordance with this clause. It is the responsibility of employees to provide details of their fund registration to the Employer or to complete fund registration documents as the case may be.
>
> (f) Where a dispute arises as to the amount of superannuation contributions to be paid and such dispute cannot be resolved between the individual employee and the Employer then this dispute must be referred to authorised representatives of SPAA and MEAA who must endeavour to reach agreement. Should agreement not be reached the matter may be referred to Fair Work Australia in accordance with the terms of clause 39.
>
> (g) **Nothing in this clause will reduce any statutory obligation on the Employer to pay superannuation contributions on behalf of an employee under Superannuation Guarantee Legislation.**

This means that production companies are required to pay crew superannuation **even if they earn less than $450 gross a month**. This is really important for entry-level crew who are doing a single day on a television show or feature film, for example. It also means that under the MPPCA, superannuation is paid on contracted hours (including contracted overtime). However, under the BREA, it is not paid on overtime.

For further information on this agreement, please contact [Screen Producers Australia](https://www.screenproducers.org.au) or the [Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance](https://www.meaa.org).

## Super For Actors

In addition to having [their own special tax rate](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Schedule-3---Tax-table-for-actors,-variety-artists-and-other-entertainers/), if an actor is employed under the [Actors Television Programs Agreement (ATPA)](https://www.meaa.org/download/australian-television-programs-agreement-atpa-summary/), or the [Australian Feature Film Collective Agreement (AFFCA)](https://www.meaa.org/download/equ-agmt-affca-2012/), they also have different superannuation rates than your average worker (including film and television crew), in a similar way that people working in the public sector also [get a higher superannuation rate](https://www.finance.gov.au/superannuation/arrangements-for-australian-government-employees/pssap/).

There a few important things to note, and it’s also important to be aware of the differences between the two agreements.

The **AFFCA** states:

> (a) In addition to all other payments provided for by this Agreement, the Producer shall make a superannuation contribution pursuant to the Superannuation Guarantee Legislation to the Media Super or such other fund as nominated by the Artist on behalf of the Artist, **at the rate of 10%** on the following:
>
> (i)  the Artist’s Composite Fee; and
>
> (ii)  **all regular contracted overtime (whether or not worked)** noted at Clause 3 of the Performer’s Standard Contract (Schedule “A”) paid to the Artist for the duration of the engagement provided that if the total of (i) and (ii) above exceeds $240,000 paid by the Producer to the Artist in any one financial year the Producer will not be obliged to pay a superannuation contribution on the component of the Artist’s payment in excess of $240,000 in that financial year.
>
> (b) Juvenile Artists shall not be entitled to the benefits of this clause unless:
>
> (i) The Juvenile is engaged on a 12 week contract or longer; or
> (ii) The Juvenile has been employed in the Entertainment Industry for a minimum of six professional engagements; or
> (iii) The Juvenile has previously been employed in the entertainment industry for a minimum of 30 days.
>
> (c) The Producer shall **make contributions to any Artist over the age of 70**, who would not otherwise have received a contribution as a consequence of section 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Therefore the provision of section 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 will not apply to this agreement. In the event that a Producer is not able to make contributions to a superannuation fund on the Artists behalf the Producer will make a payment, equal to the required superannuation contribution identified in clause 40(a), directly to the Artist and will identify the payment on the Artists statement of earnings as a “superannuation payment.”

The **ATPA** on the other hand states:

> (a) In addition to all other payments provided for by this Agreement, the Producer shall make **superannuation contributions at a rate of 1% above the minimum superannuation guarantee contribution rate** pursuant to the Superannuation Guarantee Legislation to Media Super on behalf of the Performer. **Superannuation guarantee contribution rates for Performers will be based on a Performer’s Total Fee.**
>
> (b) If the aggregate of the Performer’s Total Fee paid by that Producer to the Performer exceeds $200,000.00 in any one financial year, the Producer will not be obliged to pay a superannuation contribution on the component of the Performer’s Total Fee in excess of $200,000 in that financial year.
>
> (c) Juvenile Artists shall not be entitled to the benefits of this clause unless:
>
> (i) The Juvenile is engaged on a 12 week contract or longer; or
> (ii) The Juvenile has been employed in the Entertainment Industry for a minimum of six professional engagements; or
> (iii) The Juvenile has previously been employed in the entertainment industry for a minimum of 30 days.
>
> (c) The Producer shall **make contributions to any Artist over the age of 70**, who would not otherwise have received a contribution as a consequence of section 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Therefore the provision of section 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 will not apply to this agreement. In the event that a Producer is not able to make contributions to a superannuation fund on the Artists behalf the Producer will make a payment, equal to the required superannuation contribution identified in clause 40(a), directly to the Artist and will identify the payment on the Artists statement of earnings as a “superannuation payment.”

Long story short – with both agreements, even if you’re actor is over 70, you still need to pay them superannuation. If you’re doing a film the actors superannuation rate is **10%**, however if you’re doing TV the actors superannuation rate is **10.5%**.

For further information on these agreements, please contact [Screen Producers Australia](https://www.screenproducers.org.au) or the [Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance](https://www.meaa.org).

## Super For Artists

[The National Association for the Visual Arts](https://visualarts.net.au) has a [Fees & Wages PDF](https://visualarts.net.au/media/uploads/files/CHAPTER_7_-_2017_5.pdf) which covers superannuation. It’s well worth a read.

---

## Super For Editors

[The Australian Screen Editors](https://www.screeneditors.com.au) has both a [public](http://www.screeneditors.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ASE-Rates-and-conditions_public_2017.pdf) and a [members only](http://www.screeneditors.com.au/resources/wages-condition/) rate card which also covers superannuation and the employer versus contractor discussion. This document is extremely detailed and well written, so well worth reading in detail.  Keep in mind however that the ASE is a guild and not a union, and they can not enforce rates and conditions.

## Making Life Easier For Production Companies

It’s really annoying and time consuming to have to chase up superannuation details for contractors and freelancers. When you send your ABN Sole Trader invoice, please make sure you also send a completed [Super Choice form](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/SPR56761NAT13080.pdf) along with a [Tax File Number declaration](https://www.ato.gov.au/Forms/TFN-declaration/) (as we need your Tax File Number & Date of Birth for Superannuation processing). It’s also a good idea to include your superannuation details on your Tax Invoice, if you have a Sole Trader ABN, as it will make the production companies book keeper very happy.

## Penalties For Not Paying Super

If a company does not meet their [super guarantee obligations](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/how-much-to-pay/), they may be liable for a range of penalties or charges **on top** of the super guarantee charge. Interest can be charged, as well an Administrative penalty, and fines for failing to keep records, failing to offer an employee a choice of super, failing to pass on a tax file number and failing to provide an SGC statement when required. This can add up REALLY quickly.

Swinburne University recently [underpaid their staff by $3.66m](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/higher-ed-daily-brief/swinburne-university-underpays-staff-366m/news-story/3cfcc9a18511285c5b514100d923c550). This number is made up of approximately $3.66 million owed to staff in underpaid superannuation ($2.13 million) and $1.53 million in interest.

The director of a company that fails to meet an SGC liability in full by the due date automatically becomes [personally liable](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Your-workers/In-detail/Director-penalty-regime/) for a penalty equal to the unpaid amount.

## What Do I Do If I’m Owed Super?

The first step is always to contact your employer, and explain the situation. Given how long this blog post already is, you can see just how complicated and confusing superannuation can be – so chances are your employer was just mis-informed, or made an honest mistake, and will happily help you resolve.

Failing that the ATO has an [Unpaid Super](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Growing/Unpaid-super/) guide to help you investigate the situation.

Importantly, on 24 May 2018, [Minister for Revenue and Financial Services announced](http://kmo.ministers.treasury.gov.au/media-release/056-2018/) the commencement of a 12 month [Superannuation Guarantee Amnesty](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Super-for-employers/Proposed-Superannuation-Guarantee-Amnesty/) (code name: “The Amnesty”).

The Amnesty is a one-off opportunity for employers to self-correct past [super guarantee](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/how-much-to-pay/) non-compliance without penalty.

Subject to the passage of legislation, the Amnesty will be available from **24 May 2018 to 23 May 2019**. However, even though the legislation has not been passed but you can [access this Amnesty now](https://www.ato.gov.au/Newsroom/smallbusiness/Super/Missed-a-super-guarantee-payment-/?sbnews20180606).

[According to the ATO](https://www.ato.gov.au/Newsroom/smallbusiness/Super/Missed-a-super-guarantee-payment-/?sbnews20180606), employers who are not up-to-date with their super guarantee payments and who don’t come forward during the Amnesty **may face higher penalties in the future**.

**UPDATE (SEPTEMBER 2019):** The legislation failed to pass through parliament, however on 18 September 2019, the legislation was reintroduced. You can read more about this [here](https://www.equitykeep.com/what-is-the-superannuation-guarantee-amnesty).

## Insurance & Workers Comp

If you’re working as a contractor or run your own PTY LTD, it’s also really important to know and understand the implications when it comes to insurance (including, but not limited to Public Liability & Professional Indemnity insurance) and also Workers Compensation (which varies from state to state in Australia – just to make the whole topic extra confusing). It’s vital that you know what policy you’re covered under, so that if something unfortunate and unexpected does happen, you don’t have to worry about the insurance side of things.

WorkSafe Victoria has [some information](https://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/insurance/types-of-workers) on determining if someone is considered a worker by WorkSafe.

The Fair Work Ombudsman has links to all the [individual states and territories regulators](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/workers-compensation) for further information.

## Suggestions For The ATO & Wider Industry

As you can see Superannuation is a fairly complex and complicated topic, especially for those of us in the Film & Television industries.

Here’s some things I’d LOVE to see implemented by the ATO & Industry Guilds & Unions:

* I would love for the ATO to release some superannuation case studies on their website that specifically address those working in Film & Television (similar to the case studies you’ll find [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Building-confidence/Case-studies/)).
* As discussed above, the [Employee/contractor decision tool](https://www.ato.gov.au/Calculators-and-tools/Host/?anchor=ECDTSGET&anchor=ECDTSGET/questions/ECDT#ECDTSGET/questions/ECDT) can sometimes give some misleading results. I would love to ATO to add some further detail and clarification to the tool.
* I would love the [Australian Screen Editors (ASE)](http://screeneditors.com.au) to either release their full rate card publicly, or at the very least, provide the full rate card to all [Screen Producer Australia (SPA)](http://screenproducers.org.au) members. What the ASE has done with their full rate card is incredibly awesome and very comprehensive – and it seems such a shame to restrict it’s access to just full fee paying ASE members. I personally believe it would be WAY more beneficial to the filmmaking community if producers and production companies had easy access to this document. I will be actively pushing this with the ASE.
* I would love for the ATO to run some workshops in conjunction with Screen Producers Australia, Screen Australia and Film Victoria on superannuation, and Workers Comp insurance for our industry.
