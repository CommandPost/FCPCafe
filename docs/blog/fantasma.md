# Fantasma

This is a really, really boring film that shows a group of people aimlessly walking around a theatre, and eventually watching a section of an equally boring film. But, despite the fact that the images on the screen put you to sleep, the soundtrack and music is truly amazing. The attention to detail is just incredible. You really just need to watch this film with your eyes closed, which admittedly, I did for most of the film. It really is some of the most sophisticated and complex uses of sound Iâ€™ve ever heard in a film. It reminded me much like the first Alien movie.
