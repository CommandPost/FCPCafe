# Northern Light

This is a film about a kickboxing coach and his son’s struggle with life after losing their wife/mother and daughter/sister in a car crash two years previous. The father is a well respected and highly regarded kickboxing teacher, but his career is put in jeopardy after he hits his son in front of guests and students at a birthday barbeque, after his son makes a peculiar attempt for his father’s attention. As father and son separate, the film explores the two coming to turns with the past, of love and of what the future holds. As a viewer, I could quite easily connect with the characters and feel their pain and frustration. The look of the film was quite beautiful, with some lovely colourful scenes. I also loved some of the more modern sections of the soundtrack. There are even a few small laughs scattered throughout the movie.
