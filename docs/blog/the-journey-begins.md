# Sir Peter Jackson

I was in Bali over the last week and was reading Peter Jackson’s biography and one thing became evident to me. There is a single reason why that man succeeded, in not only becoming a brilliant film maker, but also making people stand up and take notice of his homeland.

And that reason isn’t luck. He wasn’t in the right place at the right time or slept with the right person or even knew someone who was in the right place in the right time so that they could sleep with the right person.

He succeeded in doing all these things because he loved film, and not just a particular genre either, he loved all films. And he decided one day that he was going to spend his life making the films that he wanted to go and see, not the films that he was told he should go out and make but the films that made him laugh and cry and allowed him to escape. After all isn’t that why we all go to the movies…..to escape?

And this my friends brings us to SHOTGUN! I want to welcome you to my blog which will allow you to follow three film makers just like the man mentioned above who want to make films they would go and see with people they want to work with. It is going to be an intense 12 – 18 months with a huge number of mountains to climb and we want you to be with us the whole way from start to finish!!

Chris, Al and myself have already been working tirelessly for over 6 months on the project and Al in particular has been nursing his baby through for near on 4 years now! What we are attempting is to show that you can make a great movie that people wanna see for little to no money. We nod our heads to the likes of the SAW boys, the guys behind VAN DIEMANS LAND and also GABRIEL, The Sperieg Brothers who made UNDEAD and then went onto make DAYBREAKERS and to all those other film makers out there like Mr. Jackson who have proved that passion and the right team can make not just movies but GREAT movies happen!

So fill up the fridge and strap yourselves in kids cause it’s gonna be one hell of a ride!
