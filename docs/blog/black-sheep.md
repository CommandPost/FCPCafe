# Black Sheep

Essentially this is a New Zealand film about a whole lot of mutant sheep that go on a rampage to try and kill everyone, due to a generic engineering experiment going horribly wrong. It’s tremendously funny, and gives the audience exactly what they want – sheep killing people. The visual effects are fantastic, and are so real that they’re funny. To be honest, I don’t know what else to write. It’s a lot of sheep killing people – nothing more, nothing less! It’s completely mad, and very fun! Everything is tongue in cheek. The story isn’t hugely complex, or that well written, but it doesn’t really matter. No one really cares about these things when there’s some sheep killing to be had! Very sick – very funny!
