# The Betel Tree

This is a cute film about two people who reflect on their betel-chewing, teeth-lacquering and their displaced past while creating future memories for their grandchildren. Although it offered an interesting insight into another culture from my own, I found the story rather boring, although there were some funny moments (such as when one of the ladies was getting high of chewing betel).
