# A Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory

This is a documentary about the mystery disappearance of the Warhol Factory’s Danny Williams in 1966. Williams was in love with the art of lighting and film making, but was also heavily experimenting with drugs, sleeping with his male boss, Andy Warhol, and falling in and out with the other artists. It’s a film that sets out to discover what really happened the night he left his car on a cliff face, by looking over never-seen-before footage, including many films Williams made at the Factory, and interviewing friends, family and co-workers, about his past. It’s an interesting insight into a man’s life. Personally, I found it a tad boring – as I didn’t really know much about Williams coming into the film, and the way he was portrayed, meant that I didn’t really care to learn more. It was cut together pretty well – mixing interviews and archive footage, and some of the interviews were incredibly interesting, however, the film as a whole just didn’t grab me.
