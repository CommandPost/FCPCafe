# Sniffer

I really loved this short film. It’s basically about a society that has the ability to fly, and yet, everyone is locked down by gravitation boots. One day, a simple man’s ungratifying humdrum routine is broken when a bird invades his workplace, inspiring him to escape his dull life. The look of the film is very simple and monotonous. No fancy special effects and no psychedelic colours. And yet, that is what makes this film so special. The soundtrack is also fantastic. I especially like the sounds on the gravitation boots hitting the ground. Although it’s a simple story, with simple production elements, it’s a very effective film that keeps you hooked from start to finish.
