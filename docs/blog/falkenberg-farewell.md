# Falkenberg Farewell

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2007**

This film is a snapshot into a lives of several young people holed up in a small town called Falkenberg. It’s not a traditional narrative – but more a mood piece, trying to capture what it’s like growing up in that seemingly boring environment, and how these people deal with crossing over from adolescence to adulthood. This is a very slow and almost observatory film, with lots of shots of scenery, and people just hanging about. It tries to evoke emotion, not through dialogue, but more beautiful images of mundane things. It does have one tragic scene, which adds some more energy to the film, but for the most part, this is just a very measured and leisurely film about growing up.
