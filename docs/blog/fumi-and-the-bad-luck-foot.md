# Fumi and the Bad Luck Foot

**Written by Chris Hocking on 21st August 2006**

This is a great little animation about Fumi and her cursed foot. After surviving a lighting strike, a hippopotamus attack and bank vaults falling on her foot, Fumi discovers a way of using her curse as a powerful tool to help others. This is a cute little animation that proves that cute little characters getting hurt really is good comedy!
