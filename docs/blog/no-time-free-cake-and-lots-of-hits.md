# No time, free cake and lots of hits!

**Written by Chris Hocking on 14th June 2009**

Hello everyone! Well, it really feels like it’s been a long time since I last posted any updates, and guess what… it has been! As always we’ve been incredibly busy behind the scenes with so many different things. As some of you may have noticed we launched a [new blog](http://nick.latenitefilms.com "Nick Colla") run by Nick Colla, which has been attracting lots of hits. I’m still unsure whether it was a wise move to give Nick his own blog, but I haven’t received any court orders as of yet, so that’s always a bonus.

Jacqui Hocking has also started [selling](http://blog.jacquihocking.com/toptotop-dvd/ "TOPtoTOP") her short film on TOPtoTOP via the latenite films site which has also been quite exciting. Incidentally, she also just left last Wednesday to continue her adventure travelling around the world on a beautiful yacht filming her travels for part two of the TOPtoTOP documentary series, but also for Swiss TV. Make sure you keep an eye out on her [production blog](http://blog.jacquihocking.com/ "Jacqui Hocking's Production Blog") as I’m sure she’ll be posted lots of interesting things every now and again.

Unfortunately our three entries to MAFMAD did not get through, which is a bit disappointing. We thought we had three really fantastic concepts, but we must have been up against some serious competition. Oh well – there’s always next year!

The Sakooz website is still on hold at the moment. We haven’t touch it for a while now – but are hoping to get onto it soon.

This blog’s been attracting more and more visitors which is fantastic! Our FCP vs Avid article now has hundreds and hundreds of hits, and our FCP predictions post is well into the thousands! Thanks so much to everyone for all your support! Please keep the comments coming!

Our Twitter feed has also been very successful so far. We’re nearly at the 300 followers mark – which is pretty good. Obviously we’d much prefer to be in the thousands range – but each day another few people follow us, so we’re slowly getting there. If you have any comments or suggestions in terms of what we post, then please let us know!

And as always we’ve also got lots of other exciting projects and productions in the pipeline…

Finally, make sure you come along to the Pocket Bonfire Productions fund-raiser night to promote their latest film, “There’s a Hippopotamus on our roof eating cake”. As you probably know, I’ve been helping them organise the photo-realistic hippo for the film, so this is a project very close to my heart! It’s certain to be a fantastic night, with free cake on entry, a book reading with the author, plus lots more! It’s at Loop Bar, where we ran our Sakooz fund-raiser last year – so it’s sure to be just as exciting and fun! For all the details check out their site:

Well that’s it for today. Hopefully we’ll see you at the fund-raiser!

Best Regards, Chris!
