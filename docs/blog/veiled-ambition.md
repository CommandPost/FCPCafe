# Veiled Ambition

This is a short documentary about Frida, an Australian Muslim who attempts to set up a Boutique clothing shop in Melbourne. It documents her highs and lows, as she tries to bring in a profit. The narration was good, and the story was interesting. The highlight for me personally, was learning that her husband worked for a boxing promoting company that owes the company I worked for a hell of a lot of money!
