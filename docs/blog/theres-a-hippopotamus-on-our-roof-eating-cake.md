# There’s a Hippopotamus on our Roof Eating Cake

It seems like so long ago now that we were on the hunt for people to help us build an animatronic hippo for Pocket Bonfire’s production of *“There’s a Hippopotamus on our Roof Eating Cake”*! Well, not only has principle photography well and truly wrapped, but even post production is now slowly drawing to a close – which is all very exciting! For further details on the production make sure you keep an eye on [Pocket Bonfire’s Website](http://www.pocketbonfire.com "Pocket Bonfire Productions"). Exciting times certainly lay ahead, as we have big hopes for this amazing little film! Congradulations Jaime Snyder (Director), Joel Sharpe (Producer), Jessica Lawton (Editor) and Lachlan Harris (Sound Design) for all their hard work! It looks like it’s paying off… We can’t wait to see the finished result!

You can watch a trailer of the short film below. Enjoy!
