# Unreal Engine - 23rd June 2023

The awesome team at S1T2 have done a great blog post about their Unreal Fest presentation titled, **UnrealFest 2023: How lateral thinking could revolutionise your real-time pipeline**.

You can read it [here](https://s1t2.com/blog/unrealfest-2023-how-lateral-thinking-could-revolutionise-your-real-time-pipeline).

I also had an amazing chat with **Matt Drummond** last night, and here's some awesome facts he didn't mention in his presentation:

- Roughly 7 person film crew for the live action shoot
- Edited, Sound Mixed and Colour Graded in DaVinci Resolve
- Shot on Blackmagic Cameras

You can also find some of his awesome YouTube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/@hivestudiosinternational/videos).
