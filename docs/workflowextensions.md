### Reading Is Fundamental!

**Reading is Fundamental!** is a versatile, multi-format document reader in a Workflow Extension so you can read documents without leaving Final Cut Pro.

Reading is Fundamental! reads and displays:

- PDF
- Word (.doc and .docx)
- Pages
- Excel (.xls and .xlsx)
- Numbers
- PowerPoint (.ppt and .pptx)
- Keynote
- Comma-separated values (.csv)
- Rich Text Format (.rtf and .rtfd)
- Plain text (.txt)

Most document types allow you to zoom in and out by using your trackpad’s “pinch with two fingers” — if you’ve enabled this in **System Preferences > Trackpad**. (Not supported by Rich Text Format or Plain Text files.)

Multiple documents can be opened at the same time, and you can switch between them (using navigation arrow buttons or the popup menu).

The previously opened documents will be restored on relaunch.

The workflow extension window floats above Final Cut Pro so you can view your document and project timeline at the same time.

The workflow extension window can be repositioned, resized, and saved as part of a Final Cut Pro workspace layout.

### Recall Toolbox

**Recall Toolbox** is a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension that acts as a Shared Pasteboard.

Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store.

#### Build for Final Cut Pro

There are third party tools like the amazing Copy 'Em ​(for Mac), but they're not quite as visual as Recall Toolbox, and they're not built from the ground up for Final Cut Pro users.

Recall Toolbox works as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, so it's window position gets saved with your custom Workspaces.

Whilst CommandPost has had a Shared Pasteboard & Pasteboard Buffers for years, it's really optimised for Control Surfaces. You can access the Shared Pasteboard from the CommandPost menubar, and it is super powerful, but it's not as visual - you just get text, not a fully customisable thumbnail.

Recall Toolbox feels like a natural extension to Final Cut Pro, with a similar look and feel to Final Cut Pro's Effects Browser.

#### iCloud Sync

Recall Toolbox automatically syncs to ALL your devices on the same iCloud account automagically!

#### iCloud Sharing

You can share folders with other iCloud users, and control permissions. For example, you could have a "read only" folder that contains client logos for a current job!

### BRAW Toolbox

**BRAW Toolbox** allows you to import Blackmagic RAW files directly into Final Cut Pro without transcoding.

No more waiting. No more transcoding. No more massive ProRes files.

Save hours of time, and terabytes of storage!

The BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension allows you to prepare all of your footage prior to import. You can easily and quickly change all the RAW parameters, and copy and paste settings from different BRAW clips. You can even save and restore Presets that contain specific parameters, saving time for example, if you always use the same Gamut & Gamma.

Once imported into Final Cut Pro, you can still modify the RAW parameters at any time.

You can even keyframe the ISO, Exposure, Color Temp, Tint and Custom Gamma Controls!

BRAW Toolbox comes with a Metadata View that allows you to view every piece of BRAW Metadata directly within the Final Cut Pro Inspector.

There are automatic Decode Quality options for both HD and UltraHD projects, and you can also work at a low Decode Quality, then apply a "Global Setting" to force Full Quality prior to exporting - meaning you never have to worry about creating proxies for performance. BRAW Toolbox gives you complete freedom and flexibility.

You can also use the Workflow Extension to send your project/timeline to DaVinci Resolve for grading - all using BRAW files directly from the camera!

BRAW Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 or later.

### Marker Toolbox

**Marker Toolbox** allows you to import Vimeo CSV, Wipster CSV, Dropbox Replay JSON & Email Comments into Apple's Final Cut Pro via a handy Workflow Extension.

You can also OPTIONALLY use OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate email comments into markers using your own personal OpenAI API key!

If you use Vimeo Review pages or Wipster to share video edits with clients to consolidate feedback, you can simply export a CSV file from Vimeo or Wipster, and drag it into the Workflow Extension to convert the comments into Markers within Final Cut Pro. It's fast and easy!

Dropbox Replay works exactly the same way, except Marker Toolbox will also import any drawn annotations!

Similar to Frame.io's Workflow Extension, the markers come in as a Compound Clip, that you can then "break apart" so that the markers are attached to the clips in your Primary Storyline, meaning that your clients comments stay in the correct position as you make revisions to the edit. For each marker, there's also a title, so that you can easily visually see the comments right in your Viewer - this is great if you need to export an edit with all your client feedback "burnt" into the export.

Replies and the date the comment was added can be included in the Marker names. It also takes "resolved" comments in Vimeo, Wipster & Dropbox Replay, and marks them as "completed" in Final Cut Pro!

You can also easily copy and paste client feedback from emails into the Workflow Extension. In most cases, you can use the "Process Comments Locally" button to use a custom-built algorithm that converts each line of text into a comment. However, you can also the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT to help translate more complicated feedback into markers. You can customise the ChatGPT prompt, and also pick the ChatGPT Model. You supply your own OpenAI API key, giving you full control.

This can be a MASSIVE time saver, as you can simply copy and paste a long list of email comments, and ChatGPT will do the work to convert them into easy-to-read Final Cut Pro markers, that you can then easily navigate via the Timeline Index.

Marker Toolbox requires Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 or later.

### Gyroflow Toolbox

**Gyroflow Toolbox** allows you to import Gyroflow Projects into Final Cut Pro.

Gyroflow is a free and open source third-party application that can stabilise your video by using motion data from a gyroscope and optionally an accelerometer. Modern cameras record that data internally (GoPro, Sony, Insta360 etc), and Gyroflow stabilizes the captured footage precisely by using them. It can also use gyro data from an external source (eg. from Betaflight blackbox).

Gyroflow Toolbox allows you to take the stabilised data from Gyroflow and use it within Final Cut Pro as an effect, so you don't have to export a ProRes from Gyroflow!

You can even use this in conjunction with BRAW Toolbox (also on the App Store), to stabilise Blackmagic RAW files!

None of this would be possible without the incredible Gyroflow project and the incredibly help and support from their main developer, AdrianEddy.

### DAWBridge

**DAWBridge** is an extension for Final Cut Pro that syncs Logic Pro, Pro Tools and other DAWs to Final Cut Pro. Using the DAW Bridge, cleaning up audio, composing music and mixing become virtually effortless and you never need to leave your favorite video editing software. When you sync your DAW with Final Cut Pro, audio will only play from your DAW so if you'd like your original FCP timeline audio to play as well, export your audio to your DAW using the share menu.

There are a few simple steps to linking Final Cut Pro with your DAW:

1. First, open the DAW Bridge extension in Final Cut Pro
2. Make sure your timecode settings are the same in both applications:
3. Project start timecode must match. For example, 01:00:00:00.
4. Frame rates must match for the timecode to work correctly. Hint: you can drag your Final Cut Pro project into the DAW Bridge window to pull its frame rate.
5. Match sample rates in your DAW and Final Cut Pro
6. In your DAW, navigate to the MTC settings and select 'DAW Bridge In'.
7. In Logic Pro you can find this in the transport or in Synchronization preferences.
8. In Pro Tools it is under Peripherals → Synchronization

Once your timelines are in sync, your DAW's playhead can control Final Cut Pro's playhead. The DAW Bridge combines the power of your audio and video editors. Imagine what you can do.
