We've recently reported two annoying **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 bugs** to be across:

- [FCPXML v1.11 doesn't support Soundtracks (May 28, 2023)](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/94)
- [Audio Presets don't migrate from earlier versions to v10.6.6 (May 27, 2023)](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/92)

We've reported them to Apple, and will keep track of them in our [Bug Tracker](https://fcp.cafe/bugtracker/).

**Sex O'Clock** premieres today in Czechia. Episodes 3, 6, 9 and 10 was cut in Final Cut Pro by [Jiří Fiala](https://jirifiala.cz) (the other episodes were cut in Adobe Premiere).

FCPXMLs were sent to DaVinci Resolve for colour grading and X2Pro was used to send AAFs to ProTools for mixing. The sound designer was very impressed with the neatness of the timeline.
