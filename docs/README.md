**Final Cut Pro 10.6.8** has been released on the Mac App Store!

If you're currently using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier** we recommend sticking with that for the time being.

However, if you're using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** we recommend updating, as it resolves some issues with the Viewer going black and various crashes.

You can learn more about the issues in **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/223).

Additionally, **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** and **Final Cut Pro 10.6.8** use a newer Library format than **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.

This means that if you want to use [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.io) to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)**.
