**Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** has been released, and whilst there have been some users that have reported zero issues, there's many professionals that are reporting lots of unexpected bugs and crashes.

There currently doesn't seem to be any common thread - people on Apple Silicon, Intel, Monterey, Ventura, etc. are all reporting different problems across all areas of the application - from Viewer going black to full system shutdowns.

For now, I would strongly suggest you stick with **Final Cut Pro 10.6.5** or **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6** until Apple resolves these issues in a future update.

We are keeping track of the bug reports [here](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/223), in our [Bug Tracker](/bug-tracker). We've reported several bugs directly to Apple.

I've personally been pushing **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7** pretty hard since it's release on a new, big and complex timeline, with heaps of Motion Templates, effects, stills and random footage. I've had to restart it a few times due to the Viewer going black, or strobing, and so far I've had one crash.

Additionally, **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)** uses a newer Library format than **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.

This means that if you want to use [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.io){target="_blank"} to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)**.
