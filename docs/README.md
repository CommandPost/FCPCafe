!!!danger WARNING:

After spending a day with **Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)** on a new, big and complex timeline, with heaps of Motion Templates, effects, stills and random footage, it's pretty buggy. I've had to restart it a few times due to Viewer going black. Would stick with Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 or 10.6.6 until Apple resolves these issues.

**Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)** uses a newer Library format than **Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)**.<br />
This means that if you want to use [Transfer Toolbox](https://transfertoolbox.io){target="_blank"} to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using **Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)**.
