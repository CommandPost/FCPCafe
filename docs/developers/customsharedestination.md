# Custom Share Destination

You can receive rendered media (movies), editing descriptions for project timelines, library archives, and FCPXML for other Final Cut Pro items in your app.

You can read [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/content_and_metadata_exchanges_with_final_cut_pro/receiving_media_and_data_through_a_custom_share_destination).

Unfortunately the documentation is fairly complex, and there's no good sample code to get started quickly.

It is especially very confusing if you're a Swift / Swift UI developer, with no experience in Objective-C.

However, I've uploaded a old sample project from Apple to GitHub, along with an attempt to "wrap" the Objective-C code in a Swift application.

You can find [**ShareDestinationKit** on GitHub](https://github.com/latenitefilms/ShareDestinationKit).
