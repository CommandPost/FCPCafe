# LLM Workflows

This section is dedicated to talking about how you can use LLMs (Large Language Models) for coding in the Final Cut Pro development space.

This page is very much a work-in-progress and evolving space, so stay tuned!

## ChatGPT

I've been using the Mac ChatGPT Desktop app for a LONG time, and has been my go-to LLM for a long while now.

I find the **5.2 Thinking** model to be insanely useful, and quite good at working with both Swift and Objective-C code.

I currently have **Enable customisation** turned off, so that I don't wasn't context/memory.

I also have **Reference saved memories** disabled for the same reason.

I have **Improve the model for everyone** disabled for privacy reasons.

In terms of crafting a prompt, I generally do it in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), and try to give as much useful detail and possible.

I'll sometimes copy across header files, API documentation, etc. - as much information as possible to ensure "someone" who had no idea about the problem I'm presenting, could be instantly brought up to speed.

## Claude Code

I've recently started playing around with the **Claude Code** Mac Desktop App, and it's already proven insanely helpful.

I've been using the **Opus 4.5** model.

I'm currently on the **Yearly Pro Plan**, with `AUD$100` in extra credit, so avoid waiting around when you hit hourly or weekly limits.

It's awesome if you just want to point the LLM to your codebase and let it go forth.

I've been trying to put as much helpful information in the project repository folder as I can - for example, SDK documentation, header files, log files, crash logs, etc.

## Codex

In addition to Claude Code, I've also been testing out the **Codex** Mac Desktop App.

I've been using the **GPT-5.2-Codex Extra High** model.

Codex comes with my ChatGPT subscription, so it's a pretty good deal.

So far, Codex and Claude Code seem very capable.

Clade Code is more "chatty" and gives a better insight into what it's "thinking", whereas a lot more magic seems to happen under the hood with Codex.
