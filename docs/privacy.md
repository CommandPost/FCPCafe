# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** Tuesday 12th December 2023

FCP Cafe does not use cookies on its website.

We do not collect any personal identifiable information from you when you visit our Website.

We don't embed any videos - we only show a thumbnail which links to the video - to prevent third party cookies/trackers.

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) to host the markdown files for this website.

We use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) for DNS hosting, [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) for hosting, and [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au) for domain hosting.

We use [CloudFlare Website Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/web-analytics/).

Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or `localStorage`, to collect usage metrics. It also doesn't “fingerprint” individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics.

You can read [CloudFlare's privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/privacypolicy/).

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues) to manage our [Bug Tracker](/bugtracker/) & [Wish List](/wishlist/).

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/discussions) to manage the comments and discussions on the site.

The comments feature at the bottom of every page is powered by [giscus](https://giscus.vercel.app), which also has no tracking or database.
