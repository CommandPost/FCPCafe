# Wish List

This page is dedicated to keeping track of Final Cut Pro feature requests, via our [GitHub issues site](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues).

**The only way Apple's management will put bug fixes and feature requests into their engineers work queue is if they have a Feedback Request about it.**

To submit a new feature request, simply sign up for a free GitHub account and [post an issue](https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature-request.md&title=).

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a **safe and secure** developers platform used by **over 73 million users** worldwide.

We also keep track of the most popular feature requests, based on the amount of reactions the issues get.

In general, whenever posting a new feature request to GitHub, we also submit feedback directly to Apple via [Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com), and make a note of the Feedback Assistant ID in the issue.

You can also send feedback directly to the Final Cut Pro team [here](https://www.apple.com/feedback/finalcutpro/), although unlike Feedback Assistant you can't track your request or add additional information - so we generally recommend you use Feedback Assistant instead.

**Richard Taylor** also maintains a list of [101+ Requests for Final Cut Pro](https://fcpx.tv/top.html).
