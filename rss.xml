            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

<p>We're still working on the formatting - they're currently a bit &quot;buggy&quot; in terms of automatically resizing, and sometimes require a hard page reset to appear properly. We're investigating a proper fix - stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta</strong> with 14-bit MIDI CC is <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/">now available</a>.</p>
<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commentary Head of Editing:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been so incredibly exciting watching all the professional editors contributing to this site via GitHub (check out these <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">closed pull requests</a>!).</p>
<p>I proposed creating <a href="https://avid.cafe">avid.cafe</a> and <a href="https://premiere.cafe">premiere.cafe</a>/<a href="https://premierepro.cafe">premierepro.cafe</a> on some big Facebook Communities and my posts were <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1664442143262543872">pretty quickly removed</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Final Cut Pro community has fully embraced my <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisatlatenite/status/1661729178826477569">crazy spur-of-the-moment idea</a>, and gone full steam ahead - love it!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new <strong>MediaExtension</strong> Framework, which is <strong>BIG NEWS</strong> for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.</p>
<p>This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support.</p>
<p>This means that for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!</p>
<p>We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox</strong> v1.1.4 (51) is <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">now available</a> on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.</p>
<p>Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.</p>
<p>As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> the default option as a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a <strong>Custom</strong> Solids Generator.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.</p>
<p>We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.</p>
<p>To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a <strong>Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)</strong> Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.</p>
<p>HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.</p>
<p>We'll leave <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Russ Hughes has written a great blog post titled: <strong>I Ignored Davinci Resolve - I Was Wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>It explains why he jumped from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve for editing, from a sound designers perspective.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/i-ignored-davinci-resolve-i-was-wrong">here</a>.</p>
<p>For context, for the stuff <a href="https://latenitefilms.com">LateNite</a> does Final Cut Pro is still king, for the simple fact that it’s the most fun and most creative tool to edit with.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve is INSANELY powerful, and Blackmagic is a much more friendly company to work with than Apple.</p>
<p>However, I personally feel like I'm an engineer when using Resolve, whereas in Final Cut Pro I feel like an artist.</p>
<p>You can do amazing things in both tools - but Final Cut Pro feels like the better instrument for creative flow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just to keep you on your toes...</p>
<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.2.2 (54)</strong> is out now, with some internal improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a bunch of additional checks to the FxPlug4 Renderer, to ensure that all objects received from the Blackmagic RAW SDK are valid and correct to avoid any potential crashes due to referencing null pointers. Thanks for reporting Dominik Radecki! Big thanks to the Blackmagic RAW team and Final Cut Pro team for all their help and support!</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've thrown together a simple Python script called <strong>Rename Avid MXF Files</strong>.</p>
<p>It's used to rename MXF files generated by Avid Media Composer to match the <strong>Package Name</strong> in their metadata.</p>
<p>The script can process a <strong>single file</strong> or a folder containing <strong>multiple</strong> MXF files.</p>
<p>This is useful if you want to move native Avid MXF files from Avid Media Composer to Final Cut Pro.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses an issue where audio effects would not be reset during playback.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an Audio Units effect could have incorrect values when importing using FCPXML.</li>
<li>Improves waveform redrawing on expanded audio components when adjusting volume with the Touch Bar.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where the Voice Isolation Amount slider would snap to 0% when trying to set a value less than 7%.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with the Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Control Range setting in the Color Adjustments effect would be incorrectly set to SDR when importing using FCPXML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this update requires a database update, so there must be some bigger changes under the hood.</p>
<p><img src="/static/database-update.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad 1.1</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn snapping on or off using the keyboard shortcut N.</li>
<li>Move the playhead backward or forward 10 frames using the keyboard shortcuts Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow.</li>
<li>Show info for browser clips using the keyboard shortcut Control-I.</li>
<li>Turn skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut S.</li>
<li>Turn audio skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut Shift-S.</li>
<li>Split and switch multicam clip angles using the keyboard shortcuts 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>Show or hide the jog wheel using the keyboard shortcut Control-Shift-W; expand or collapse it using Control-W.</li>
<li>Switch the jog wheel between playhead mode and nudge mode using the keyboard shortcut Shift-W.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with custom fonts not appearing in the inspector.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when dragging a clip from the browser to the timeline.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue with keyboard shortcuts not working as expected in the content browser.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback when adding effects and transitions to timeline clips in Position mode.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where importing media on a device with no remaining storage would cause Final Cut Pro for iPad to quit unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where importing clips with the same name would generate blank clip thumbnails.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when using soundtracks and dynamic titles.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where copying and pasting transform settings would unexpectedly paste clip speed.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback and reliability when rating and adding keywords to clips while filtering clips in the browser.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where resetting audio settings would unexpectedly reset clip speed.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with the appearance of onscreen controls for cropping and shape masks.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where clip height adjustments would not update audio-only clips in connected storylines.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Keywords window would open offscreen with the timeline minimized.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where disabled multicam audio angles would appear in the audio component list in the inspector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 on Mac uses a newer Library format than Final Cut Pro 1.1 on iPad. This means that if you want to use Transfer Toolbox to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using Final Cut Pro 10.6.6.</p>
<p><strong>Compressor 4.6.5</strong> is out now with the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Settings and Locations sidebar to now be resizable when the Inspector is open.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when processing 4:2:2-based H.264 media on Mac computers with Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where the color space of a Photo-JPEG source was incorrect when Color space was set to Automatic.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an exported IMF supplemental package was one frame shorter than the original package.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motion 5.6.5</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves stability with FxPlug 4 plug-ins.</li>
<li>Improves stability when dragging a group that contains an FxPlug plug-in to the Favorites folder.</li>
<li>Improves performance when using the Sequence Text behavior with Anchor Point set to Line (in the Layout pane of the Text Inspector).</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited to test it out, and see if there's other undocumented fixes and improvements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[20th July 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been cutting all day with <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a fresh job (i.e. not something migrated from 10.6.6), and it has a LOT of third-party Motion Templates, effects, random still images, random videos in a variety of formats, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst I was able to successfully edit, and export without too many dramas, 10.6.7 definitely seems more buggy and unreliable than 10.6.6.</p>
<p>I had to manually quit and restart Final Cut Pro quite a few times throughout the day because the Viewer was just black. Nothing I could do would bring it back to life, apart from a restart.</p>
<p>This is consistent with other professional long-form editors I've chatted to.</p>
<p>After one of the restarts, after applying an cut to an audio clip, and adding a transition, suddenly the Viewer went &quot;strobing&quot; - again, requiring another manual restart.</p>
<p>I haven't had any crashes, but it's definitely got... issues.</p>
<p>One major <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/217">confirmed bug</a> is that Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 doesn't properly respect 0% opacity in Motion Templates. For example, if you apply the <code>Placeholder</code> Generator, it will ALWAYS show the notes:</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpx-10-6-7-bug.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This could be a deal breaker if you're using a Motion Template that uses this technique to hide things. Luckily none of the Motion Templates I used today had any issues.</p>
<p>It's also worth nothing that <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 (for Mac)</strong> uses a newer Library format than <strong>Final Cut Pro 1.1 (for iPad)</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that if you want to use <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a> to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 (for Mac)</strong>.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to stick with Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 for now, and wait for another bug fix in a few weeks time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>From the team behind Audio Design Design, <strong>SoundGen</strong> is a generative AI experience that turns your text prompts into music and art, with the option to download the files and add them into your film and audio projects.</p>
<p>The beta program is entirely free for you to use and experiment with. As SoundGen matures, the developers will be integrating it directly into <strong>Audio Design Desk</strong>.</p>
<p>Their goal is to give their users access to an even broader collection of sounds on demand, right within the DAW.</p>
<p>The alpha version can only do a maximum of 30 seconds. Depending on the prompt, sometimes it can found great, other times it's very computer generated. It'll definitely improve dramatically over time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.8</strong> is now available on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p>The release notes only have one line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixes an issue where video could freeze in the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, based on early reports, this release seems to fix the various crashes that users were reporting too, in addition to the Viewer sometimes going black or strobing.</p>
<p>If you're currently using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier</strong> we recommend sticking with that for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if you're using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> we recommend updating.</p>
<p>Please make sure you make a backup of your Final Cut Pro application by creating a <code>ZIP</code> file of it, before updating. You should also manually backup any libraries before updating.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We've just released a very niche new app to the Mac App Store called <strong>Fast Collections</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>thousands of keywords</strong> across many events, it can take a long time to create a new Smart Collection with your preferred keywords directly within Final Cut Pro - but with <strong>Fast Collections</strong>, it can now take seconds.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Luke Nash</strong> is an up-and-coming Final Cut Pro &amp; Motion Developer who's currently working on some awesome new tools to help with building complex user interfaces in <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/final-cut-pro/motion/">Apple Motion</a> easier, faster and more powerful.</p>
<p>His latest project, <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, is an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/fxplug?language=objc">FxPlug4</a> plugin that works in Apple Motion to provide a powerful rectangular on-screen control that can be used and combined with other Apple Motion effects. For example, if you wanted to build a colour correction tool with powerful masking features, you could use <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> to allow your users to draw masks via an on-screen tool in the Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro Viewer.</p>
<p>Whilst <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> has been written in Objective-C using the FxPlug4 API (Apple Motion's Effects API for third party developers) - it's easily accessible within Apple's Motion, just like regular built-in tools, so anyone who's making Motion Templates in Apple Motion can make use of this functionality without knowing any code. Essentially these are tools to make it easier for people to make awesome Motion Templates, which can then be &quot;exposed&quot; in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Luke is currently demonstrating <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> via a series of YouTube videos, with the intention of trying to raise funds to cover a new Mac and Apple Developer Account via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">this Indiegogo campaign</a>. If he can raise the necessary funds to finish <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong>, he will release the software for free, and potentially even open-source.</p>
<p>There are very few FxPlug4 developers in the world, especially in terms of solo indie developers - so it's awesome to see Luke really tackling uncharted territory. These tools could potentially be game-changers to the growing list of Final Cut Pro YouTuber's that are also building their own Motion Templates to sell.</p>
<p><strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> is still very much a work-in-progress, with a beta build hopefully coming in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <strong>OSCar Rectangle</strong> and his other <strong>Luke’s Got Groups</strong> project <a href="https://lukesgotbrains.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the Indiegogo project <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/oscar-phase-1">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7th September 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our good friend <strong>Bradley Andrew</strong>, founder of <a href="https://filmdrives.com">FilmDrives</a> and creator of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/crew-call/id1532198878">Crew Call</a>, has just released a really exciting new iPad App onto TestFlight.</p>
<p><img src="/static/video-assist-logo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Whilst this isn't strictly Final Cut Pro related - I'm sure it'll be of interest to many of the Final Cut Pro Community - especially those shooting, as well as editing. There's a whole world of possibilities here, for both production and post.</p>
<p><strong>Video Assist</strong> allows you to use your iPad as an external monitor and recording device with compatible USB Capture Cards.</p>
<p>You can easily record videos or capture frame grabs from any HDMI Video Source. SDI Video Sources are also supported with specific capture cards.</p>
<p>Video Tools such as Color Correction, Transform, Grid Lines, Center Marks and Aspect Ratio Masks are built-in.</p>
<p><strong>Record Trigger</strong> is supported for all ARRI Alexa and Sony Venice Cameras via a custom computer vision model.</p>
<p>Support for RED and Blackmagic Cameras will be coming prior to public launch.</p>
<p>Only yesterday Bradley built <strong>RGB &amp; Luminance Histograms</strong> into the app and has enabled a clean video output from the iPad. This means you can use your iPad as a recorder and then output a clean video feed of live or playback via a USB-C to HDMI Adaptor or via AirPlay.</p>
<p>To date, the only way to use your iPad as a monitor is via a <a href="https://qtakehd.com/hardware/screenport/">QTake ScreenPort</a> or the <a href="https://accsoon.com/accsoon-seemo/">Accsoon SeeMo</a> range.</p>
<p>This app-based approach is super exciting, as it allows people to use off-the-shelf hardware to turn under-utilised USB-C iPads into great displays.</p>
<p>USB Capture Cards range from $20-$250 depending on compatible resolutions, so they are well within reach for most people.</p>
<p>You can watch a short demo of the app in action on YouTube:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KxTDOyLeWQ"><img src="/static/video-assist-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Bradley is super lovely and insanely talented, and <strong>Video Assist</strong> is such a great implementation - you can tell he's had decades of experience in the camera department, as the user interface is so familiar and easy to use.</p>
<p>We've been chatting with Bradley about all the possibilities for hooking up his app to Frame.io and Final Cut Pro for more seamless exchanges of favourites/selects and on-set notes. Exciting times!</p>
<p>If you are curious and want to test it for yourself on a <strong>USB-C iPad running iPadOS 17 Beta</strong>, you can try the pre-release version via Apple TestFlight <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/vgjAL68x">here</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s iPhone Media Event is scheduled for 12th September, and typically new iOS versions go live the day after the event or at the end of that week.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Apple released updates to Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Pro for iPad, Motion and Pro Video Formats.</p>
<p>These updates drop support for macOS Monterey - only macOS Ventura and Sonoma are now supported, which is disappointing, but not surprising.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we've already had reports from <a href="https://fxfactory.com">FxFactory</a> that the Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 update has at least one serious bug.</p>
<p><strong>FxFactory</strong> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.6.9 is now available on the Mac App Store. This version breaks all FxFactory products that perform object tracking or face recognition through the Title layer.</p>
<p>Regrettably this constitutes the entirety of our catalog featuring object tracking or face detection, since developers and users alike have come to favor the Title layer for its flexibility.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of products affected, we recommend that you do not apply this update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read more about this bug <a href="https://fxfactory.com/news/finalcutpro-10.6.9-skip-the-update/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, Apple doesn't provide beta releases to most third party developers, so it's a mad scramble to test and review updates once they're made public.</p>
<p>We're currently in the process of testing and reviewing all the updates, and will post more on FCP Cafe as new things come to light.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For developers, Apple has also updated the FxPlug 4 SDK.</p>
<p>At this stage, there's been no update to the Workflow Extensions SDK (currently at v1.0.2, released in January).</p>
<p>The <strong>FxPlug 4.2.8 SDK</strong> includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of unsupported FxPlug 3 properties from the FxPlug framework</li>
<li>Support for GPU and backwards analysis in the <code>FxBrightnessAnalysis</code> example</li>
<li>Plug-ins built with newer SDKs now handle canceling of analysis without crashing in older hosts.</li>
<li>The template and example properties have been updated to conform to the removal of some FxPlug 3 properties. This includes the <code>kFxPropertyKey_UsesRationalTime</code> and <code>kFxPropertyKey_IsThreadSafe</code> properties.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when an FxPlug 4 plug-in with custom UI displayed in the inspector crashed, or was terminated by the OS. It will now redraw its custom controls immediately rather than waiting until the next communication with the plug-in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with a potential crash when using the <code>FxColorGamutAPI</code>.</li>
<li>Analysis no longer returns frames with a 1-pixel border around them.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Fast Collections</strong> is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to quickly create a <strong>Smart Collection</strong> from a list of <strong>Keywords</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fast-collections-1-1-0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as <strong>feature-length documentaries</strong> with <strong>hundreds of clips</strong> and <strong>thousands of keywords</strong>, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new <strong>Smart Collection</strong>, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>This was originally intended to be a very niche application, primarily used by long-form documentary editors.</p>
<p>However, as requested by Vigneswaran Rajkumar, we've added the ability to <strong>Generate</strong> a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc.</p>
<p>This is very handy for long-form projects, so to make the application more accessible, we're also reduced the price to a one-time payment of <strong>USD$9.99</strong> on the <strong>Mac App Store</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Picture This</strong> allows you to harnesses the power of Generative AI to create unlimited, copyright free images from a Final Cut Pro Project right on your Mac, using the latest version of Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-01.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-02.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/picture-this-03.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>To quote the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create stunning AI text-to-image artwork from Markers in your Final Cut Pro Projects or Premiere Pro Sequences. Picture This… takes the text-to-image prompts from Markers in a Project or Sequence and generates image variations for each prompt, and returns these images to Final Cut Pro as a new Project with Auditions, or to higher tracks in a Premiere Pro Sequence, for easy comparison.</p>
<p>Using the latest version of Stable Diffusion, Picture This… provides background batch processing of images and the convenience of Auditions in your Final Cut Pro Projects.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong>
Create your prompts where you will use them: in red Markers in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Processes as a Batch in the Background</strong>
Batch processing allows to you use your time productively while Picture This… — your “art department” — does it’s AI magic.
Important: Do not continue working on that timeline. Any work you do on your edit will not be included in the results returned from Picture This…</p>
<p><strong>Aligned in your Edit</strong>
New images display right where you need them in your timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong>
Use multiple passes to hone in on the image you need. Optionally, fine tune the prompt each time.
Images are always free, whether you generate one or 1000.
Processing happens on your local Mac, never in the cloud.</p>
<p>Images cannot be copyright individually, but do not limit the copyright on the finished project.</p>
<p><strong>How it Works</strong>
In Final Cut Pro enter your image description (text-to-image prompt) in a To-Do Marker where you want the image to start. Or in Premiere Pro, add a red Sequence Marker with a prompt. Images continue to the next Marker or to the end of the underlying clip.
Export and Import XML, or drag a Project (FCP only) to Picture This….
Choose your settings and click Start to generate images.
After processing the Project is returned to Final Cut Pro with Auditions, and each Audition contains the alternative images for each prompt. Or the Sequence is ready to import to Premiere Pro, with the generated images stacked on Video Tracks above your existing edit. There will be on track for each alternate image generated from the prompts.
You can modify prompts and send the Project/Sequence to Picture This… again.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>
An Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Sonoma
At least 8GB of RAM, but 16GB or more is recommended
English text-to-image prompts are currently supported
It requires macOS Sonoma and an Apple Silicon Mac.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We were very sad to learn today that <strong>fcp.co</strong> has officially disappeared from the Internet.</p>
<p>The site now permanently redirects to Peter's <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com">idustrialrevolution</a> website.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpclose.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>We've been a big fans of everything Peter has done with fcp.co over the years, especially the incredible case studies.</p>
<p>I've personally been very fortunate to have articles about CommandPost, BRAW Toolbox, Gyroflow Toolbox and the Neighbours spin-off series, Erinsborough High featured on the site. HUGE thank you to Ronnie, Alex &amp; Iain for writing articles about our stuff!</p>
<p>Running a website like fcp.co is a HUGE amount of work, especially when you're running a very active forum, so massive hats off to Peter for keeping it going for over a decade!</p>
<p>Peter explains <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com/blogs/news/whatever-happened-to-fcp-co">on his site</a>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FCP.CO?</strong></p>
<p>Good, question, hopefully this short blog will answer a few queries about the life and eventual closure of the best Final Cut Pro website.</p>
<p>The site ran for over 12 years, it started before Final Cut Pro X was released and surfed the wave of creation, innovation and finally in the latter years, frustration.</p>
<p>First of all, it is very hard to run a news site about a product when there isn't any news!  Although there are some very active individuals in the FCP ecosystem who make a lot of noise, there isn't much happening these days.</p>
<p>That might be because there are hundreds of thousands of happy FCP editors out there that just get on and edit. It might be because everyone has bought every FCP product they need. Or have the majority of editors shifted over to Premiere and Resolve?</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the old problem of the cost and effort of running a site compared to the return. Although we had a few great advertisers who worked with us for a long time, there were a lot of companies who wanted a lot for nothing. That doesn't pay the bills. We were in fact quite shocked by the rudeness of a few individuals when asked for help after promoting their products/services for free for a number of years.</p>
<p>Over the last 18 months our hosting became a problem. What started off as a brilliant home for the site, lost all of its peripheral services and scheduled maintenance that made the site tick over. So it was either move the site to a new host that had better customer care, or close.</p>
<p>So, why is the explanation of the closure on this website? Because, for the majority of its life, Idustrial Revolution's sales have underwritten the cost. We were in discussion with a few parties about taking over the site, but they all eventually fizzled out.</p>
<p>It breaks my heart to close the site, I still believe FCP is the fastest and most creative NLE out there, but the industry doesn't share the same opinion. At one point Apple had a massive share of the NLE market with FCP7. FCPX never really recovered from the disastrous launch and Premiere (as bad as it was/still is) filled the vacuum.</p>
<p>Finally, chapeu to a few of the people that made the site the success it was. Thank you to David R, Sam, Ronnie, Roger, Philip &amp; Gregg, Iain, Oliver and of course Karsten who without his daily help, the Forum would have died under a mountain of spam.</p>
<p>All is not lost though, I will add content to the blog section on this site. So please come back, you might even like one of our plugins!</p>
<p>Peter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can checkout Peter's awesome plugins and blog posts over at <a href="https://idustrialrevolution.com">idustrialrevolution</a>.</p>
<p>We hope he continues to release new and exciting Final Cut Pro plugins, and interesting blog posts!</p>
<p>We're also hopeful <strong>FCP Cafe</strong> can help fill the void fcp.co has left for Final Cut Pro professionals - especially in terms of Case Studies.</p>
<p>The aim for FCP Cafe has always been for it to be open and community driven. You can learn more on our <a href="/contribute/">Contribute page</a>.</p>
<p>It's all hosted and managed from GitHub, so people can always fork the site (like <a href="https://sequence.film/docs/">Sequence already has</a>!) - so hopefully it will never disappear from the Internet.</p>
<p>Thanks again Peter for EVERYTHING you've done for the Final Cut Pro Community! Onwards &amp; Upwards!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Blackmagic Design writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we announced new lower prices for the Blackmagic Cloud Store family of high performance network storage. The Blackmagic Cloud Store Mini 8TB is now reduced by $710 to $1,645, Blackmagic Cloud Store 20TB is reduced by $1,950 to $5,645 and Blackmagic Cloud Store 80TB is reduced by $7,400 to $15,595. These new prices will help make high performance network storage affordable for anyone!</p>
<p>Blackmagic Cloud Store and Blackmagic Cloud Store Mini are extremely fast high capacity network disks designed to handle the large media files used on Hollywood feature films. The design uses an advanced flash memory core so it easily handles lots of simultaneous users accessing media files at the same time. There is also an HDMI monitoring output so you can watch a live graphic view of the storage operating on a TV or monitor. Plus, with built in Dropbox and Google Drive sync, files can be distributed between multiple Blackmagic Cloud Stores globally so each site has very fast local file access, even though files can be distributed on lower cost internet connections.</p>
<p>Blackmagic Cloud Store models are in stock and available from Blackmagic Design resellers worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really interesting for Final Cut Pro users, as Blackmagic's network storage is now one of the most cost effective options around.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6th November 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today was day one of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p>The day opened with an incredible talk with Nick Harauz interviewing the amazing <strong>Justine Ezarik</strong> (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey_c7U86mJGz1VJWH5CYPA">iJustine</a>).</p>
<p>Nick was the perfect interviewer, helping create an engaging, entertaining, insightful and honest conversation that was a joy to listen to.</p>
<p>Justine is so incredibly talented and insanely hard working. The talk provided a unique insight into how a person with <strong>7.1 million</strong> YouTube subscribers runs her business, stays healthy, deal with trolls and haters, collaborates with other like-minded YouTubers, and how her and her editor use Final Cut Pro, <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#postlab">PostLab</a> and <a href="https://frame.io">Frame.io</a> to create great content quickly and consistently.</p>
<p>She's the real deal - open, honest, no bullshit, hard working, genuine.</p>
<p>Next up <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8raOG7HXJoCUygx219fU4A">Chris Lawley</a></strong> talked about how he's gotten rid of his Mac all together, and moved completely to iPad and Final Cut Pro for iPad, in another very insightful, engaging and entertaining talk.</p>
<p>Then after a rather tasty boxed lunch, we all jumped on three buses and headed to <strong>Apple Park</strong>.</p>
<p>Sadly, there was no photos or videos allowed to be captured whilst in Apple Park.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaApNeppjvg">watch this 2018 video on YouTube</a> which shows some amazing drone footage of Apple Park during construction.</p>
<p>We all had special passes stored in our iPhone Wallets to gain access to the park, getting one of two coloured Apple lanyards (which we could keep) on entry:</p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-invite.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-id.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We then walked around the insanely impressive Apple Park building, with friendly Apple staff evenly spaced along the fairly long walk making sure everyone was going the right way, with no phones out.</p>
<p><img src="/static/apple-park-sign.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We then all entered an awesome little conference room inside the Apple Park circle, with one of the best LED screens and sound systems I've ever seen in that kind of smaller scale conference room.</p>
<p>Apple gave an insanely slick and polished presentation showing off the upcoming Final Cut Pro 10.7 release. Seriously - perfect sound, perfect presentations - it was like watching a keynote talk.</p>
<p>There was no NDA, and we were strongly encouraged to share things online (but again, no photos at Apple Park).</p>
<p>You can find all the specific details about the announcements here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can read the official Apple News Room Article titled <strong>Final Cut Pro takes video editing on Mac and iPad to the next level with powerful new features</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/final-cut-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-get-powerful-updates/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can read <strong>Iain Anderson's</strong> ProVideo Coalition article on <strong>More details: Final Cut Pro 10.7 at the FCP Creative Summit</strong> <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/more-details-final-cut-pro-10-7-at-the-fcp-creative-summit/">here</a>. Iain is at the conference.</p>
<p>You can listen to <strong>Richard Taylor</strong> talk about the release on his YouTube Live Stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrO7PxoKD4g">here</a>. Richard is at the conference.</p>
<p>You can read <strong>Scott Simmons's</strong> ProVideo Coalition article on <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.7 announced, shipping later this month</strong> <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/final-cut-pro-10-7-announced-shipping-later-this-month/">here</a>. Scott is not at the conference.</p>
<p>You can watch <strong>Matthew O'Brien</strong> talk about <strong>HUGE Final Cut Pro 10.7 Update Just Announced!</strong> on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56GklXX2YDE">here</a>. Matthew is not at the conference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was nothing discussed in person that hasn't been publicly announced in the Apple News Room, however, one thing that was mentioned in passing in the demo room is that the Scene Removal Mask machine learning model has been dramatically improved on iPad and Mac, which is super interesting.</p>
<p>One interesting point to note is that even though the <strong>Scary Fast</strong> event wasn't cut in Final Cut Pro (yes, it was cut in Premiere) - everything for <strong>Apple Fitness+</strong> is - over <strong>4,700 videos</strong>, 15 hours every week, all cut in Final Cut Pro using ProRes. Apple is eating their own dog food, at a major scale. Also, all the WWDC talks this year were cut in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>After the Apple presentation we were then broken up into two groups. Whilst one group got a guided tour of further along the exterior of Apple Park, the other group went inside a demo room, where friendly Apple Staff showcased the latest Mac and iPad hardware, running the pre-release Final Cut Pro, and latest Logic Pro updates.</p>
<p>Apple Park is incredible - it's such a beautiful complex. Everything is perfect, everything is clean, everything smells good, everything inside is the perfect temperature, everything tastes good.</p>
<p>In the demo room we were able to play, hands-on with the new hardware. Yes, obviously I tried duplicating lots of audio clips to see how the scrolling timeline performed with a giant complex timeline, and I did get a spinning wheel of doom - but with the fairly complex demo timelines they had, it worked great.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vincentlaforet.com">Vincent Laforet</a> was there to answer any questions about the new iPhone's - which is pretty special in of itself.</p>
<p>In terms of the Final Cut Pro announcements, it was basically exactly what I was expecting. After Apple finally gave us Dupe Detection, it was also fairly predictable that this would be the year that they'd finally give us a scrolling timeline - and it does look great.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm really happy with these incremental updates to Final Cut Pro, and they'll make my life as an editor better.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be super interesting to see what PostLab has to demo!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7th November 2023]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today was day two of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with some super exciting news first...</p>
<p>Another unexpected thing that came out of yesterday's demonstration room at Apple Park is there's another undocumented feature in Final Cut Pro 10.7 that wasn't talked about in the official Apple Presentation...</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.7 has enhanced the <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> feature, so now if you’re in a Keyword Collection in the Browser, it will stay in that Collection if you reveal a clip from the timeline that’s in that Collection - meaning it no longer goes back to the &quot;base&quot; event, which is a HUGE workflow improvement!</p>
<p>For example, lets imagine you have an Event with a whole heap of graphics, music and sound effects in it, sorted by Keyword Collections. If you have the sound effect Keyword Collection selected in the Browser, and you <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> on a sound effect on the timeline, it will find that clip in the Browser, without changing the currently selected Keyword Collection.</p>
<p>In Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and earlier, pressing <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> would always go back to the &quot;root&quot; Event, so this is a big change, and hopefully removes the need of CommandPost's <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> action!</p>
<p>This is one of those little things that seems like such a small minor improvement, but is a MAJOR time saver. The whole reason CommandPost exists in the first place is that it was originally designed to make finding the playhead easier for Scott Simmons after match framing clips!</p>
<p>Apple is listening. Apple do care.</p>
<p>Another very exciting piece of news that came away from the show floor is that comedy feature film, <strong>For When You Get Lost</strong> has won the <strong>Audience Award for Best Comedy Feature</strong> at the <strong>Austin Film Festival</strong>!</p>
<p>This was cut in Final Cut Pro by <strong>Jeffrey Asher</strong>. Written by Jennifer Sorenson. Directed by Michelle Steffes.</p>
<p><img src="/static/for-when-you-get-lost.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>HUGE Congratulations Jeffrey and the team! We will be releasing a case study about this film in the future.</p>
<p>Back to the Summit...</p>
<p>The day opened with the <strong>Shaping the Future: Panel Discussion</strong>, hosted by Nick Harauz, and featuring Jenn Jager, Steve Martin, Andy To and myself (Chris Hocking).</p>
<p>Whilst I'm normally always &quot;behind the camera&quot; rather than in-front - I definitely had a lot of fun, and really enjoyed both Nick's fantastic questions/moderating, but also all the intelligent and thoughtful answers from Jenn, Steve &amp; Andy, who are all so insanely talented, hardworking and super smart.</p>
<p><img src="/static/future-panelists.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Afterwards there was sessions with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warp Speed Editing Techniques in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Mark Spencer</li>
<li><strong>Let's Grade Together</strong> with Jeff Greenberg</li>
<li><strong>Sound Advice; How to Use Roles to Master Your Mix (Mac)</strong> with Steve Martin</li>
<li><strong>Mastering Transitions in FCP and Motion</strong> with Jenn Jager</li>
</ul>
<p>I only personally attended Mark's first session - which was awesome, as you'd expect.</p>
<p>We then broke for lunch, with some yummy lunch boxes - generally speaking, eating outside on large tables.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-lunch.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After lunch there was some more sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compress to Impress</strong> with Jeff Greenberg</li>
<li><strong>iPhone Workflows in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Abba Shapiro</li>
<li><strong>Creating Stunning Graphics in Final Cut Pro and Motion</strong> with Robin Kurz</li>
<li><strong>PostLab - The Event of the Year</strong> with Paul Matthijs Lombert, Jasper Siegers, and Isaac Terronez</li>
<li><strong>Why Multicams are One of Final Cut Pro’s Most Powerful Features</strong> with Dylan Bates</li>
<li><strong>360° Footage in Flat Timelines</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
</ul>
<p>I only personally attended the PostLab session and Dylan's session - which was really great. Dylan is so enthusiastic, so lovely, so talented, but also there was some really fantastic audience engagement and discussion, and tips were definitely shared both ways, which is awesome! It was a really fun, educational and collaborative talk.</p>
<p>But PostLab. Wow.</p>
<p>For those that don't know about <a href="https://hedge.video/postlab/benefits">PostLab</a> already, it provides incredible cloud based and on-premise collaboration for Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer &amp; Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>It's powerful, and used by a huge amount of professional Final Cut Pro editors around the world. It's subscription, or you can buy PostLab Local for your own on-premises server solution.</p>
<p>Here's what the currently shipping public version looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/static/old-postlab.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However today, Hedge threw all that away, and has essentially announced they've started from scratch on a completely new version of PostLab, that uses the same perpetual licensing as their other Hedge products (like <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#offshoot-formally-hedge">OffShoot</a> and <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#editready">EditReady</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because this new version is early days, soon to be released in &quot;Early Access Preview&quot; (i.e. beta), they've asked not to share any screenshots of the user interface shown, as things may change during development - so no screenshots here.</p>
<p>They've completely changed things architecturally - rather then requiring any cloud infrastructure, it now runs on your local machine, which means it's fast, and there's no ongoing cost.</p>
<p>There will be a standard version, and a pro version - similar to how OffShoot now works.</p>
<p>PostLab will now also support ANY and every application - not just Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere and Avid Media Composer. You can manage Pages and Numbers documents, Logic Pro projects, etc.</p>
<p>But the thing that blew my mind is <strong>Event Locking for Final Cut Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>Essentially how it works is that you create a <strong>Team Bundle</strong> anywhere you like, which contains all your data. It's similar to a Final Cut Pro Library in that it's a package (i.e you can right-click and select <strong>Open Package Contents</strong> in Finder).</p>
<p>The standard version will support a single Team Bundle, and the Pro version will offer unlimited Team Bundles.</p>
<p>You can then create <strong>Collections</strong> within the PostLab interface however you want, like Final Cut Pro and iTunes/Music. These Collections can contain any <strong>Documents</strong> (i.e. files).</p>
<p>However, where the magic lies is that if you create a Final Cut Pro library, PostLab now manages the individual events within that library.</p>
<p>For example, you could create a Collection for &quot;Episode 1&quot; and &quot;Episode 2&quot;, which each contains it's own Final Cut Pro Library. However, shared between BOTH of those libraries, you could have a single Event for &quot;Sound Effects&quot; that is common between both libraries, in both collections.</p>
<p>PostLab manages all these individual Final Cut Pro Events, so that only one person can claim ownership of them (i.e. check them out) at a time. So, for example, the &quot;Episode 1&quot; editor could be the owner/have checked-out the &quot;Sound Effects&quot; Event, which means that any other editors that try to open this Event will still be able to open it, however, PostLab will automagically inject a 🔒 emoji in the filename, so you can visually see in Final Cut Pro that the Event is essentially read-only, and no changes to that locked Event will be saved.</p>
<p>This is... magic. I have no idea how it works, because unlike in Avid Media Composer, for example, you can't just copy and paste Events between Library bundles, like you can with Avid Bins.</p>
<p>However, the geniuses at Hedge have somehow managed to make Final Cut Pro Events, behave exactly the same as Avid Bin's. It's magic, and amazing.</p>
<p>Everyone at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit has the opportunity to request access to the &quot;Early Access Preview&quot; that will go live at some point later this month.</p>
<p>The new version of PostLab will not only be massive for collaboration, but solo editors - because the new version of PostLab brings simple git-like versioning to ANY document type. This is big!</p>
<p>It also has an absolutely fantastic new icon!</p>
<p>Next up we had <strong>The Ultimate FCP Tip Session</strong> with Jeff Greenberg hosting and Dylan Bates, Abba Shapiro, Steve Martin and Mark Spencer. There was lots of handy tips and tricks!</p>
<p>Then the last session of the day was <strong>Making Media Inclusive For All: Accessible Creative Storytelling</strong> with Storm Smith, and Jenica Teregeyo.</p>
<p><img src="/static/storm-session-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was an incredibly powerful, educational, informative and inspiring session talking about empowering <strong>every viewer</strong> through accessible media.</p>
<p>It was a very slick presentation, with some great videos showcased.</p>
<p>Here's the top five things to take away from the talk:</p>
<p><img src="/static/storm-session-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then after this session it was <strong>Networking Expo Night</strong>, where you could talk to the Hedge Team, CoreMelt Team &amp; others.</p>
<p>There was several prizes given away on the night, and free food and drinks.</p>
<p>The legends that are Philip &amp; Greg also gave away a free copy of <a href="/ecosystem/workflowextensions/#picture-this">Picture This...</a> to <strong>every</strong> Final Cut Pro Creative Summit attendee, which is amazing!</p>
<p>The Summit is all about connecting with like-minded people, and sharing knowledge, and the Expo Night was the perfect demonstration of just an insanely talented bunch of people all just hanging out together sharing tips and tricks.</p>
<p>You can watch a recording of <strong>Richard Taylor's</strong> YouTube Live Stream of the Expo Night <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU3vX1QbaYc">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>...and that's a wrap!</em></p>
<p>Today was day three, and the final day of the <strong>Final Cut Pro Creative Summit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/hallway.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the first time I (Chris Hocking) have personally attended the Summit, and it's a looooooooong and expensive trip from Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, this conference has been absolutely awesome and worth every penny.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-dj.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>HUGE thank you and congratulations to both <a href="https://www.fmctraining.com">Future Media Concepts</a> and Apple for putting on such an incredible event.</p>
<p>Ben, Megan, Jessica, Elise and the rest of the FMC team, you've all done an insanely awesome job. Thank you for making us all feel so welcome, and part of your FMC family. Putting on a huge event like this is a MASSIVE job, but you nailed it. Thank you.</p>
<p>MASSIVE thank you to <a href="https://nickharauz.com">Nick Harauz</a> (Director of Product Marketing at <a href="https://borisfx.com">Boris FX</a>) for all the incredible work he did putting everything together, but also his insanely awesome leadership/MC'ing on all the panels throughout the Summit. He's a REALLY great interviewer.</p>
<p>Bill, and the rest of the Apple team, I can't imagine how much politics and incredible hard work it was to get us into Apple Park, so thank you, thank you, thank you. It was a one in a lifetime opportunity to visit the campus, and something I'll never forget.</p>
<p><a href="https://coremelt.com">CoreMelt</a>, <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com">MotionVFX</a> &amp; <a href="https://hedge.video">Hedge</a> - thank you for supporting this incredible community financially, and allowing the conference to happen at all. Please support these three awesome companies!</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/richardtaylortv">Richard Taylor</a> for allowing people at home that couldn't attend the Summit in person to still feel connected to the event via his live streams.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-dylan.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've had... concerns, about whether or not flying across the world to hang out with a bunch of Final Cut Pro editors would be a... bad investment/waste of time or not. By the time you add flights, accommodation, conference cost, food, social drinks, etc - it becomes a very expensive endeavour, and a long time away from my young family. However this conference has been unquestionably worthwhile.</p>
<p>I've had the incredible opportunity to meet people I've only previously known via the Internet. I've got to meet and make new friends from all over the world. I've been able to connect with people who use this site and my software to do absolutely incredible things. I've been able to casually chat with the team behind the tool I use every day, Final Cut Pro, as well as all the 3rd party developers that make the Final Cut Pro ecosystem so unstoppable.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-sequence.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, I've never been to previous FMC events, however what impressed me was both the turnout, and the quality and passion of the attendees. I had the honour and privilege of meeting talented people, from all walks of life, and all different parts of the industry, that use Final Cut Pro at a very high level. Everyone's a hardcore Final Cut Pro end-user.</p>
<p>It was pretty incredible how many people travelled from Australia, the UK, Germany, etc. to come to the Summit - it truely was a global audience.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-justine.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>So... what happened today? In terms of sessions, they were some of the best of the week.</p>
<p>First up we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Person Masking, Tracking and Paint in ShotAnvil, a session presented by CoreMelt</strong> with Ché Baker</li>
<li><strong>Shooting and Editing Captivating Interviews in FCP</strong> with Abba Shapiro</li>
<li><strong>Word Play: Advanced Typography Techniques in Final Cut Pro</strong> with Jenn Jager</li>
<li><strong>Hooking in Hardware</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Workflows</strong> with Nick Harauz</li>
<li><strong>Hide and Seek: Advanced Masking and Tracking in FCP</strong> with Robin Kurz</li>
</ul>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CoreMelt session first up. Ché Baker &amp; Roger Bolton did an excellent demonstration of the new <a href="https://coremelt.com/products/shotanvil-tracked-paint-masks-and-graphics-insert-with-one-click-ai-person-keying">CoreMelt ShotAnvil</a> tool.</p>
<p>You can get <strong>30% off</strong> ShotAnvil and PaintX by visiting their special Final Cut Pro Creative Summit page <a href="https://coremelt.com/blogs/news/special-deals-for-final-cut-creative-summit-23">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/coremelt-presentation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next I attended <a href="https://iain-anderson.com">Iain Anderson</a>'s <strong>Hooking in Hardware</strong> session - which showcased how he uses <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> + MIDI Controllers + Tangent Ripple + Monogram Console to control Final Cut Pro in fast and powerful ways.</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-presentation.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can watch one of Iain's older YouTube videos on MIDI controllers here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4YvDeOtpGc"><img src="/static/midi-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After another delicious boxed lunch pack in the sun, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaos to Clarity: Mastering Clip Organization (iPad)</strong> with Dylan Bates</li>
<li><strong>Controlling the Color Pipeline: HDR Workflows in Mac and iPad</strong> with Steve Martin</li>
<li><strong>Media Management Techniques</strong> with Mark Spencer</li>
<li><strong>Becoming an Accidental YouTuber</strong> with Lee Herbet</li>
<li><strong>Custom 3D Objects in Motion</strong> with Iain Anderson</li>
<li><strong>Session Presented by MotionVFX</strong> with George Edmondson</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Martin's (from <a href="https://www.rippletraining.com">Ripple Training</a>) course on HDR was incredible. It was by far the most polished and slick talk of the whole conference - I really felt like I was in a University classroom for the 45mins. Steve is such a great educator and communicator - he really takes it to another level (<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/mike-seymour.html">Mike Seymour</a>-level as I like to call it).</p>
<p>Lee's talk was also great - very interesting and engaging. You can follow his YouTube adventures <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@notacarguy_au">here</a>.</p>
<p>MotionVFX's session was also insanely awesome. What I didn't realise was this wasn't a MotionVFX session - as in, there were no MotionVFX staff attending. MotionVFX basically just paid for one of their external contractors, <a href="https://www.yourseedmedia.com">Seed Media</a> to do a talk about MotionVFX's new subscription tools, <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/subscriptions/cinestudio">CineStudio</a>.</p>
<p>George Edmondson and his team are one of MotionVFX's external collaborators, and produce and edit a lot of their online tutorials and promotional content - and what they do is really next level.</p>
<p>For example, George and his team made this entirely in Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsYYupd-nU"><img src="/static/cine-studio-youtube.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>George is such a great communicator and storyteller - but also the work Seed do for MotionVFX is world class.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-motionvfx.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can learn more about Seed Media <a href="https://www.yourseedmedia.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about CineStudio <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/subscriptions/cinestudio">here</a>. You can currently get 30% off all MotionVFX plugins <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/black-deals">here</a>.</p>
<p>At 4pm, we had <strong>Storytelling in Final Cut Pro</strong> panel with Josh Meyers, Mike Yanovich, and Robin Moran - with <a href="https://nickharauz.com">Nick Harauz</a> moderating.</p>
<p>These kinds of panels are what makes the Summit so powerful and so useful - true industry professionals, doing world-class high-end work, talking about their craft. Josh, Mike &amp; Robin are all three of the nicest, smartest and honest people you'll ever meet - and it's such an honour to hear about how they make their amazing art.</p>
<p>We hope to have detailed case studies with all three panelists on FCP Cafe in the not-so-distant future, as their projects become publicly accessible.</p>
<p>Then finally, to wrap up the conference, we had a Q&amp;A with the Final Cut Pro team - what a perfect way to wrap up the event!</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcpcs-apple-questions.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This event wasn't under NDA - however they asked for no photos, videos or recordings.</p>
<p>Microphones were handed around, and anyone could ask anything.</p>
<p>There were six people from Apple on the stage from marketing, engineering, quality control, user interface design and product manager for Final Cut Pro for iPad.</p>
<p>Obviously, with Apple being a giant complex company - the team couldn't talk about anything unannounced or future product plans.</p>
<p>The Apple team said that Final Cut Pro and ProApps are &quot;alive and well&quot; and the team is &quot;super excited about the future&quot;.</p>
<p>They said &quot;don't worry about the Aperture thing... it's not a thing&quot; - referring to the fact that Final Cut Pro won't go the way of Aperture, and be suddenly discontinued.</p>
<p>They mentioned they're really interested in seeing how people are using Final Cut Pro on iPad. They encourage people to <a href="/wishlist/">send feedback to them</a>, explaining in story form how you use their devices in the real world.</p>
<p>The audience all learnt a new term - S.P.O.D'ing - spinning pizza of death (i.e. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel">spinning wheel of death</a>). They explained that if you do ever run into the spinning wheel of doom, sending detailed feedback of exactly how you got into this state is very, very helpful.</p>
<p>You can send Apple feedback in any language - they have teams dedicated to translating the feedback.</p>
<p>Apple has a plan for Final Cut Pro and the rest of the ProApps for the next few months, AND the next 5-6 years.</p>
<p>The Final Cut Pro team constantly have meetings with the wider Apple teams - for example, they're constantly meeting with Machine Learning teams to see what technologies and techniques they can bring back to the ProApps.</p>
<p>I personally asked if we'll ever see WWDC sessions on Final Cut Pro Developer technologies like FxPlug and Workflow Extensions - and they acknowledged that this is something they'd LOVE to see.</p>
<p>Overall the Q&amp;A session was calm, civil, fun, personal and entertaining. There was no NDA secrets shared. The audience got to really connect with senior members of the Final Cut Pro team on a very human level.</p>
<p>It's always nice to remind yourself that the people behind our favourite tools are just human after all.</p>
<p>And just like that, three days of the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit was over - but the discussions kept flowing in the Aloft hotel bar for many hours more.</p>
<p>Again, a HUGE thank you to everyone at FMC and Apple for making this event happen. Thank you to EVERYONE who presented, and EVERYONE who attended.</p>
<p>It was such a privilege and an honour to attend - and it was so humbling to connect with people that use CommandPost, BRAW Toolbox, Gyroflow Toolbox, Fast Collections and even the TestFlight version of Recall Toolbox!</p>
<p>You can watch <strong>Richard Taylor</strong>'s live stream directly after the Q&amp;A session on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtJ3BgPVQyA">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can refer back to the <strong>FCPCreativeSummit</strong> hashtag on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FCPCreativeSummit?f=live">here</a>. There's some fun photos in the feed!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Today Apple has announced that Final Cut Pro will gain <strong>spatial video editing</strong> at some point <strong>next year</strong>.</p>
<p>CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-spatial-video-arrives-in-beta-and-looks-amazing-on-vision-pro/">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro, Apple's video editing software, will get Spatial Video editing support, but not until sometime next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>9to5Mac <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/10/spatial-video-vision-pro-review/">reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple released iOS 17.2 developer beta 2 on Thursday, enabling iPhone 15 Pro hardware to capture spatial videos for the first time. The public beta version just dropped as well, and so have some early press reviews of personal spatial videos on Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The company has also shared that Final Cut Pro will gain the ability to edit spatial videos sometime next year. iOS 17.2 beta 2 and macOS 14.2 beta 2 also introduce the “Spatial” media type in Photos for easy filtering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As announced at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit, Final Cut Pro 10.7 will come out later this month, so it's most likely that <strong>spatial video editing</strong> won't appear until Final Cut Pro 10.8 - maybe another 12 months away.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>John Gruber</strong> has posted a detailed blog post titled, <strong>Vision Pro, Spatial Video, and Panoramic Photos</strong>.</p>
<p>This is interesting because yesterday Apple has announced that Final Cut Pro will gain <strong>spatial video editing</strong> at some point <strong>next year</strong>.</p>
<p>John begins with...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday Apple released developer beta 2 of iOS 17.2, the first version of iOS to include support for capturing spatial video with iPhone 15 Pro models. Today came the public beta, enabling the same feature. Apple invited me to New York yesterday, not merely to preview capturing spatial video using an iPhone, but to experience watching those spatial videos using a Vision Pro.</p>
<p>The experience was, like my first Vision Pro demo back at WWDC in June, astonishing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.3.4 (62)</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>This release includes the following bug fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the previous BRAW Toolbox v1.3.3 (59) release, we made some major under-the-hood changes to improve playback performance (such as only using one shared instance of the BRAW SDK Factory). Unfortunately however, those changes resulted in the BRAW SDK not releasing used threads correctly, and as the thread count grew, eventually the BRAW Toolbox Renderer would stop working correctly in Final Cut Pro. This would only really happen on older machines, and Libraries with hundreds of BRAW clips. We've now reverted back to how we were doing things in v1.3.2 (57) and earlier, with some additional checks and protections. We will continue to research and explore ways we can improve playback performance, so that the export times of timelines with BRAW clips in Final Cut Pro get closer to what you see in DaVinci Resolve.</li>
</ul>

<p>The FAQ explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Can Blip send Final Cut Pro projects?</strong>
Yes! Unlike many other services, Blip can send Final Cut Pro .fcpbundle files without needing to zip them first.
.fcpbundle files are technically folders, and Blip fully preserves folder structures and any links within.
And of course, Blip works regardless of the tool you use, be it Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, or something else entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blip is currently a free service that allows you to send files directly between two desktop or mobile devices. It doesn't store files on the cloud - it transfers directly between devices.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Recall Toolbox</strong> is out now on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p><img src="/static/recall-toolbox-banner.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that acts as a Shared Pasteboard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store.</strong></em></p>
<p>You can even drag-and-drop clips and projects from the Final Cut Pro Browser, and link to files (such as logos on a shared drive).</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox automagically syncs to all your Mac's on the same iCloud account.</p>
<p>You can also share Folders with other iCloud users, and control permissions. For example, you could have a &quot;read only&quot; folder that contains client lower thirds for a current job.</p>
<p>Whilst there are third party tools like the amazing <a href="https://apprywhere.com/ce-mac.html">Copy 'Em ​(for Mac)</a>, they're not quite as visual as Recall Toolbox, and they're not built from the ground up for Final Cut Pro users.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox works as a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, so it's window position gets saved with your custom Workspaces.</p>
<p>Whilst <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> has had a Shared Pasteboard &amp; Pasteboard Buffers for years, it's really optimised for Control Surfaces. You can access the Shared Pasteboard from the CommandPost menubar, and it is super powerful, but it's not as visual - you just get text, not a fully customisable thumbnail.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox feels like a natural extension to Final Cut Pro, with a similar look and feel to Final Cut Pro's Effects Browser.</p>
<p>It's <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. AUD29.99, USD29.99, CAD29.99).</p>
<p>You can find out more <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Since its release yesterday, we've been busy testing and exploring Final Cut Pro 10.7.</p>
<p>So far we haven't found any issues or problems with Final Cut Pro 10.7 and <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a>, <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a> or <a href="https://fastcollections.io/">Fast Collections</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, you can read all the release notes in <a href="/news/20231201">yesterday's post</a>.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <strong>Pro Video Formats</strong> &amp; <strong>FxPlug SDK</strong> also got an update. The <strong>Workflow Extensions</strong> SDK did not.</p>
<p>There's lots of great videos out there talking about this update, such as:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>FCPXML:</strong></p>
<p>There have been no changes/updates to FCPXML in this update - it still uses <strong>FCPXML v1.11</strong>.</p>
<p>Sadly this means that FCPXML is still broken with certain text parameters - for example, <strong>Tracking</strong>, <strong>All Caps Size</strong>, <strong>Z Position</strong>, etc. don't translate properly in FCPXML:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scrolling Timeline:</strong></p>
<p>The most exciting change to Final Cut Pro 10.7 is the addition of a <strong>Scrolling Timeline</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/fcp10-7-scrolling-timeline.png" alt=""></p>
<p>CommandPost has had a scrolling timeline in Final Cut Pro since 2016.</p>
<p>FWIW - the CommandPost scrolling timeline still works in Final Cut Pro 10.7, so you can still keep using it if you prefer it to the official scrolling timeline.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, in an very early version of CommandPost, we also had a feature called <strong>Timeline Playhead Lock</strong>, which locked the timeline playhead to the centre of the timeline - but this feature was removed at some point as very few people actually used it.</p>
<p>You've also been able to turn on <strong>Enable Rendering During Playback</strong> so that Final Cut Pro keeps rendering, analysing, and generating thumbnails and waveforms even during playback - which works great in combination with CommandPost's scrolling timeline.</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-preferences.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The new Scrolling Timeline in Final Cut Pro 10.7 is definitely a big improvement from what CommandPost can offer, and is a really nice implementation, as you'll see in the various videos linked to above. Richard Taylor is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByDrUiZD57w">VERY happy</a>.</p>
<p>What's interesting though is that when you enable the scrolling timeline, it also enables Final Cut Pro's ability to generate thumbnails and waveforms during playback - and when you turn off the scrolling timeline it disables this ability.</p>
<p>It's also interesting that the scrolling timeline is disabled by default.</p>
<p>A scrolling timeline has been referenced inside Final Cut Pro for years now. My GUESS the reason it's taken so long for Apple to enable and release publicly is because they've been waiting for the hardware to catch up.</p>
<p>This also explains why it's disabled by default (along with generating thumbnails &amp; waveforms during playback), as it runs pretty slow/laggy on very complex projects/timelines, especially on older Intel hardware, and Apple don't want new users to experience that straight out of the box - hence scrolling timeline is &quot;hidden&quot; in the preferences, and not with a simple toolbar button.</p>
<p>I'm sure eventually, once you can no longer install the latest macOS and Final Cut Pro on Intel machines, then Apple will make generating thumbnails &amp; waveforms during playback always on - not just when you have the scrolling timeline enabled.</p>
<p>Once this happens, maybe they'll add a Scrolling Timeline toggle next to the Skimming button in the Timeline Toolbar.</p>
<p>In the meantime, CommandPost's <strong>Enable Rendering During Playback</strong> preference still seems to work on Final Cut Pro 10.7, which is great.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you <strong>never</strong> want to use the new scrolling timeline, but still want to generate thumbnails and waveforms during playback without CommandPost, you can also use this Terminal command:</p>
<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.FinalCut FFGenerateThumbnailsDuringPlayback -bool true
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you turn on the scrolling timeline and then turn it off again, <code>FFGenerateThumbnailsDuringPlayback</code> will also be disabled again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Library Database:</strong></p>
<p>The Final Cut Pro Library Database version has also been updated to <code>1090</code>, compared to <code>1071</code> in Final Cut Pro 10.6.10.</p>
<p>This means that any Libraries created prior to Final Cut Pro 10.7 will need to be updated to the latest format, and you can't go back from 10.7 to earlier versions of Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro does always do an automatic backup of libraries prior to updating them, we also <strong>strongly recommend</strong> manually creating a ZIP file of your library before updating too, so that you can roll back to an older version of Final Cut Pro if a major bug or regression is found.</p>
<p>The <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#backups-for-final-cut-pro">Backups for Final Cut Pro</a> application is also highly regarded for automating library backups.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3 also uses the <code>1090</code> database format - so Final Cut Pro for Mac and iPad are once again in version parity.</p>
<p><s>Unfortunately for us, Final Cut Pro for iPad has become less interesting after Apple prevented <strong>Transfer Toolbox</strong> from working - which was our solution to get from Mac to iPad.</s></p>
<p><s>We've since stopped developing Transfer Toolbox for now - you can read more about this decision in more detail <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">here</a>.</s></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (3rd Dec 2023):</strong> After writing this news entry, we've since brought back Transfer Toolbox to life with Final Cut Pro 10.7 support. You can learn more <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our big hope/dream with Final Cut Pro for iPad was to use it for doing director/client/agency selects, and then send those selects to the Mac, but ideally we want to do all the prep work on Mac - i.e. syncing everything with Sync-N-Link, etc.</p>
<p>You can easily get from Final Cut Pro on iPad to Mac, so we're now exploring ways to take the selects from iPad and translate them across to Multicam Clips created in Sync-N-Link (for example).</p>
<p>The fact that you can now import <strong>iMovie for iOS</strong> projects into Final Cut Pro for iPad might be a hint that native Mac to iPad is also on their radar/wish-list.</p>
<p>Apple still publicly advertise that Third-party Content is coming soon to Final Cut Pro for iPad - so we should see third party MotionVFX Motion Templates on iPad at some point in 2024:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Command Sets:</strong></p>
<p>The only two Command Editor items between Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and 10.7.0 are <strong>Collapse to Connected Storyline</strong> and <strong>Timeline Scrolling</strong>.</p>
<p>They did however follow the more recent macOS naming conventions, and renamed the <strong>Preferences</strong> item to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>They also replaced a lot of <strong>OS X</strong> to <strong>macOS</strong> in various warnings and error messages.</p>
<p>The built-in default Command Set also has had a few changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collapse to Connected Storyline</strong> has been added as <strong>COMMAND+SHIFT+DOWN</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Set Monitoring Angle</strong> has changed from <strong>SHIFT+V</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+M</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Start/Stop Voiceover Recording</strong> has changed from <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+A</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+OPTION+R</strong> (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).</li>
<li><strong>Record Voiceover</strong> has changed from <strong>COMMAND+OPTION+8</strong> to <strong>SHIFT+V</strong> (same as Final Cut Pro for iPad v1.3).</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Reveal in Browser:</strong></p>
<p>It's worth noting that the enhanced <strong>Reveal in Browser</strong> feature allows you to locate a clip in the Browser without losing your selected Keyword Collection or Smart Collection.</p>
<p>However, if no Keyword or Smart Collection is currently selected, it will still just match back to the Event.</p>
<p>For a number of years now, CommandPost has had a <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> action:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you trigger <strong>Reveal in Keyword Collection</strong> on a clip in the timeline that has multiple keywords applied to it, it will prompt you for which one you want to reveal to:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-reveal-in-collection-selection.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This feature still works great on Final Cut Pro 10.7, and can be handy when you want to quickly match back to a Keyword Collection, rather than an Event.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Faster HEVC &amp; H.264 Exports:</strong></p>
<p>Faster HEVC and H.264 export will only happen if you're using macOS Sonoma and a Mac with Apple M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2 Max, M2 Ultra, or M3 Max.</p>
<p>It works by <strong>simultaneously</strong> processing video segments across available media engines, but it will only split up video to the different media engines if the content is long.</p>
<p>For example, you won't get faster exports if you have a 30sec or 1min timeline, but a feature length film you'll see improvements.</p>
<p>Because an export is essentially &quot;split up&quot; into multiple chunks for different media engines, there's also some time spent at the end of the process to &quot;combine&quot; the chunks again. Whilst this is all done in the hardware, there's still some overhead, which is why it won't split things up for shorter clips (as you'll waste time combining them at the end).</p>
<p>As an example, on my <strong>2021 16-inch MacBook Pro (Apple M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 8TB SSD)</strong>, a 1 hour and 35 minute timeline was split up into three chunks for HEVC export.</p>

<p>The relink progress bar has been improved, so that the progress bar doesn't &quot;block&quot; the Relink panel interface. This means that as things relink in the progress bar, you can visually see things get removed in the matched files list.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Bugs:</strong></p>
<p>Whilst so far Final Cut Pro 10.7 has been pretty stable and reliable, I've still seen it do some funky things.</p>
<p>For example, random red lines in the Timeline for no apparent reason:</p>
<p><img src="/static/random-red-lines.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you see something similar, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/285">FB13434993</a>.</p>
<p>The Scrolling Timeline sometimes misbehaves at certain Zoom Levels. This is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/294">FB13436367</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Alex4D/status/1730929760962777529">Some users have reported</a> that Final Cut Pro thinks a QWERTY keyboard is attached, when instead a AZERTY keyboard is.</p>
<p>If you're using a AZERTY keyboard, we would suggest backing up your custom Command Sets prior to updating to Final Cut Pro 10.7, so that you can import them back in.</p>
<p>I've been able to make it crash using third party Audio Units, even after selecting <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Audio Units &gt; Validate on Next Launch</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, since at least Final Cut Pro 10.6.10, <strong>Send To Compressor</strong> doesn't correctly render any third-party audio effects.</p>
<p>If you can reproduce, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/287">FB13435050</a>.</p>
<p>The Inspector button tooltips have disappeared - it now just says:</p>
<p><img src="/static/missing-tooltips.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you can reproduce, please report it in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/286">FB13435003</a>.</p>
<p>When first installing Final Cut Pro 10.7 it had the code name for ProRes Proxy in the Rendering Dropdown:</p>
<p><img src="/static/bad-label-for-prores-proxy.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Since seeing this, ProRes Proxy is no longer an option in the Rendering Dropbox.</p>
<p>When trying to change a font, the font variation popup menu would sometimes loose it's text, and you couldn't select a different variation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when this is happening and you hover over the empty popup menu items, the render bars above the selected Title go crazy.</p>
<p><img src="/static/disappearing-menu-items.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This could prove to be a <strong>major regression</strong> - but we need to do some more testing to confirm exactly what's going on. So far some other users have been able to reproduce this, so it looks like a bug sadly.</p>
<p>If you can reproduce this issue, please let us know in <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/284">FB13434977</a>.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, it's been pretty rock solid - even when enabling the Scrolling Timeline on our massive Blackmagic RAW test timeline, which is full of all kinds of weird and wonderful BRAW clips in all different types of frame sizes, frame rates and aspect ratios.</p>
<p>We'll continue to test and explore Final Cut Pro 10.7 over the coming weeks and report any findings on FCP Cafe.</p>
<p>If you spot any bugs or issues, please make sure you report them on the <a href="/bugtracker/">Bug Tracker</a>. Thanks team!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>X2Pro5</strong> is out now on the Mac App Store at a discounted introductory rate (<strong>USD$50 off</strong>) for <strong>two weeks only</strong>!</p>
<p>The original <strong>X2Pro</strong> will remain on sale, as X2Pro5 only works on macOS Ventura &amp; Sonoma.</p>
<p>It's been completely re-written and redesigned with the following new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Apple silicon support</li>
<li>Expanded roles</li>
<li>Enhanced media management</li>
<li>Simple workflow via redesigned UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Marquis’ new X2Pro5 software has been designed to integrate Final Cut Pro projects into a professional audio workflow, enabling Avid Pro Tools to be used for audio finishing. It works by converting the exported Final Cut Pro XML into an AAF file, which Avid Pro Tools can then open as a session, delivering seamless integration between the two applications.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 is a complete rewrite of Marquis’ popular X2Pro Audio Convert software, bringing with it native Apple silicon support and a redesigned user interface.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 takes advantage of the innovative metadata-based organising features in Final Cut Pro X, with expanded role management allowing unlimited numbers of audio roles in Final Cut Pro X to be converted into Pro Tools tracks for further audio processing and finishing by the audio engineer.</p>
<p>X2Pro5 has a simple, straightforward interface and is easy to customise; for example, you can decide if you want to include disabled or inactive clips in the export, and you can choose the length of frame handles. The software provides a fully professional audio workflow for Final Cut Pro editors, enabling a very complex audio timeline to be sent to the Pro Tools audio engineer with ease.X2Pro5 faithfully translates your audio timeline along with L-cuts, J-cuts, transitions, levels, automatic gain and fade handles, as well as the incredibly powerful FCP X compound and multicam clips. Transitions are converted into linear cross fades. Audio media can be any QuickTime supported audio, non-PCM audio is converted to PCM at either 16 or 24 bit.</p>
<p>With immersive audio technology continuing to grow in popularity, X2Pro5 provides a quick way for FCP users to be able to deliver a project to an external Pro Tools audio editor, sharing the FCPXML file so they can mix – and deliver – multi-channel audio.</p>
<p>R3D media is supported.</p>
<p>We recommend rendering an off-line or proxy version of the flattened video and exporting that if a reference is needed within Pro Tools. Only audio media is translated by X2Pro5.</p>
<p><strong>System Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro X, and FCPXML from v1.7</li>
<li>macOS 13 Ventura and later. X2Pro5 is tested on the latest release macOS and the previous release.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tangent Hub Beta v1.8.6</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>For those Tangent Panel users out there...</p>
<p>They've added a great new feature to their <strong>Warp Engine</strong> which now allows you to simply record actions performed on the application’s GUI, and associate those recorded actions to a control on the panel.</p>
<p>The control can be a button, knob, dial, trackerball or ring.</p>
<p>Moving or pressing the control will trigger the playback of the recorded actions.</p>
<p>This means that there’s no longer any need to code Warp Scripts by hand (although you can still do this if you prefer).</p>
<p>Actions that can be recorded are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse moves.</li>
<li>Mouse drags. Note only a single drag can be performed in a recording.</li>
<li>Mouse button clicks.</li>
<li>Mouse scrolls. This is useful if sliders accept a scroll input.</li>
<li>Keyboard keypresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more and join their beta program via their <a href="https://www.tangentwave.co.uk">website</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just a friendly reminder that third party FxPlug4 plugins can't crash Final Cut Pro - only Final Cut Pro can crash Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This is explained in more detail on the <a href="/bugtracker/">Bug Tracker page</a>.</p>
<p>For example, Threefold Films recently <a href="https://twitter.com/3fld/status/1732731336694140955">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simon Says Transcription is crashing #fcpx and making my day harder today….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as explained on the Bug Tracker, this is a Final Cut Pro bug - nothing to do with Simon Says.</p>
<p>There is also a workaround, as documented <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/298">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox v1.3.6 (64)</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>This release contains the following bug fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a potential crash that we've been trying to solve for ages. On SOME systems (specifically systems with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf">Mac2 family GPUs</a>), Apple's Metal Framework would generate a Metal Texture that the Metal Performance Shader in the Mac couldn't actually work with, causing a crash deep within Apple's code. It was very hard to reproduce, as it only happened on certain systems - and none of ours. HUGE thank you to Apple Developer Technical Support, the Final Cut Pro Team, AdrianEddy and Warren Moore for all their constant and on-going help, assistance, guidance, patience and support!</li>
</ul>
<p>Gyroflow Toolbox also contains this same code/problem, which we've fixed - however, we're currently waiting for one more fix in Gyroflow Core before pushing publicly - hopefully soon.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris Hocking at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com">LateNite</a> has started developing his next product, <strong>Metaburner Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>Metaburner Pro is a Motion Generator that accepts a FCPXML, and &quot;writes&quot; the FCPXML metadata over the top of your Final Cut Pro timeline.</p>
<p>Think of it as basically the same as the <strong>Data Burn-In</strong> tool in DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p>It's incredibly early days - however we hope to have a <strong>early alpha</strong> on TestFlight in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We are working closely with the professional Final Cut Pro Community, to make sure it's useful for high-end productions - especially long-form projects with big VFX deliverables.</p>
<p>It will be released on the Mac App Store for <strong>USD$100</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to post them in the <a href="https://github.com/latenitefilms/MetaburnerPro/issues">GitHub Issues for Metaburner Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peak of the early development (with a placeholder icon):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi all! We’ve finally been able to release our latest documentary “To My Father” on YouTube this week now that it’s completed its primary festival run.</p>
<p>It’s a short biographical documentary about Academy Award winning actor Troy Kotsur which illustrates how he drew inspiration from his relationship with his father.</p>
<p>We were inspired to make it based on his touching speech he gave as he won the Oscar in 2022 (the first for a deaf male actor) for his performance in the movie CODA (AppleTV).</p>
<p>Our hope in making this film was to honor Troy and his father, but also to present the piece in a way that was accessible to a hearing and deaf audience at the same time.</p>
<p>Troy’s story is told in American Sign Language (ASL) with open captions on for the duration of the movie.</p>
<p>This was a truly challenging piece to edit and we had to consult with a lot of deaf experts to make sure we were accomplishing our accessibility goals. I think we did what we set out to do and I’m very proud of the finished work.</p>
<p>I hope to do a longer case study in the future now that I can reflect on the project in its completion. I appreciate all the help and support I received from the FCP community in the editing process and will pass along what I’ve learned. Please watch if you get a chance. Thank you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I really LOVE about <strong>CommandPost</strong> is how quick and easy it is to build automation tools.</p>
<p>For example, last night Nguyễn Quốc Hoàng contacted me asking the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Chris, wanna ask if you know any app that can transfer / copy tags-metadata from original clips to trimmed clip (based on filename).</p>
<p>My problem is, after the project is finish and I trimmed all the project video files into a smaller segments to archive.</p>
<p>My metadata, finder tags are lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect problem for something like CommandPost to solve, via it's powerful Lua scripting.</p>
<p>Here's the solution I quickly came up with (which was posted <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/discussions/3293">here</a> on the CommandPost GitHub Discussions):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Get a the Source Folder Path:
local lastSourceFolder = cp.config.get(&quot;tagCopier.LastSourceFolder&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
local sourceFolder = hs.dialog.chooseFileOrFolder(&quot;Source Folder:&quot;, lastSourceFolder, false, true, false)
local sourceFolderPath = sourceFolder and sourceFolder[&quot;1&quot;]
if not sourceFolderPath then return end
cp.config.set(&quot;tagCopier.LastSourceFolder&quot;, sourceFolderPath)

-- Get a the Destination Folder Path:
local lastDestinationFolder = cp.config.get(&quot;tagCopier.LastDestinationFolder&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
local destinationFolder = hs.dialog.chooseFileOrFolder(&quot;Destination Folder:&quot;, lastDestinationFolder, false, true, false)
local destinationFolderPath = destinationFolder and destinationFolder[&quot;1&quot;]
if not destinationFolderPath then return end
cp.config.set(&quot;tagCopier.LastDestinationFolder&quot;, destinationFolderPath)

-- Get a table of Source Files:
local sourceFiles = cp.tools.dirFiles(sourceFolderPath)
if not sourceFiles then
    hs.dialog.blockAlert(&quot;Tag Copier Cancellled&quot;, &quot;No source files could be detected.&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;)
    return
end

-- Get a table of Destination Files:
local destinationFiles = cp.tools.dirFiles(destinationFolderPath)
if not destinationFiles then
    hs.dialog.blockAlert(&quot;Tag Copier Cancellled&quot;, &quot;No destination files could be detected.&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;)
    return
end

-- We'll store our Source File Tags in here:
local sourceTags = {}

-- Save all our Source File Tags for future reference:
for _, filename in pairs(sourceFiles) do

<p>If you haven't already subscribed, Alex has been doing an super fun and entertaining YouTube series, called <strong>The Morning Rant</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find all the previous episodes on his YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ulti_media/videos">here</a>.</p>
<p>He recently just posted this great rant:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JTwOcQUtJA"><img src="/static/the-morning-rant.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The YouTube description says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main focus of the video is on my exploration of integrating automatic ducking into Final Cut Pro. I reflect on my past app, FCPX AutoDuck, and express the desire to enhance its functionality by making it work within Final Cut Pro. I detail the complexities of the task, involving parsing FCP XML and dealing with intricate timelines, nested timelines, and various editing techniques. I acknowledge the difficulty of achieving automatic ducking within Final Cut Pro, emphasizing the absence of this feature even in the latest versions.</p>
<p>I highlight my commitment to this project as a side venture while prioritizing the release of FCP Pause Cutter in 2024. Despite the challenges and doubts, I share my progress on Twitter, showcasing a potential icon for the app. I express skepticism about the feasibility of creating a seamless and efficient automatic ducking feature but remain dedicated to personal research in this area.</p>
<p>The video concludes with a mention of a pre-production meeting in Milan and my reluctance to take on low-budget, demanding projects. I express concerns about the future of Final Cut Pro, hinting at a possible decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a full transcript of the video, created using <a href="https://ulti.media/transcriber/">Transcriber</a> (so if there's any typos - Alex can only blame himself, haha):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there, welcome to the morning rant.</p>
<p>I know that I treat this show as a podcast because you know this should be a YouTube show but I talked to this strange camera on my car as I will talk to a microphone to a simple microphone doing a podcast and that's a problem because this is not a podcast but I treat it as a podcast because I'm a podcaster since 2011 and so after something like more than a thousand episodes I recorded sometimes even longer than one hour so this is my comfort zone.</p>
<p>A podcast is my comfort zone.</p>
<p>Doing video is something like I do to force myself to look into a camera and try to do something not so ugly.</p>
<p>So today I want to talk about what happened yesterday and because it can be interesting for everybody who's trying to understand why something happens and something doesn't happen in the realm of a Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Okay so yesterday was a very strange day because the night before yesterday I couldn't sleep because my son had a little problem trying to sleep and so it was a blank night.</p>
<p>I don't know how to translate this into English but me and my wife didn't sleep almost anything and yesterday was a strange day because I couldn't go to the office.</p>
<p>I took one day off because you have to do a lot of things related to my son.</p>
<p>We had to do vaccination, having a meeting with the teachers of the kindergarten.</p>
<p>So doing a lot of stuff and I didn't have much time to focus on anything.</p>
<p>I spent something like one hour in the office with my wife in my wife's office trying to produce something but I couldn't focus on anything and so I started doing a little research and considered that I spent one hour but it was segmented in maybe three parts because twice we had to go to the bar and take some coffee.</p>
<p>In Italy, Espresso is something like a religion and we like coffee.</p>
<p>I like coffee and then we took a lot of coffee yesterday because we needed to stay awake.</p>
<p>I tried to do some research because I created many apps that communicate with Final Cut Pro in the sense of passing data to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>You know, you prepare something into my apps and then the apps prepare something and send the data to Final Cut Pro and then you can finish the work on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>So the workflow works on my app and then after computation, decision making and something like this, the final work can be done, should be done and must be done in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>There are a lot of apps that work inside of Final Cut Pro or using Final Cut Pro data and so they can take data from Final Cut Pro, computate them and then send them back to Final Cut.</p>
<p>Okay, there are a lot of stuff like this.</p>
<p>I think that Bitmark Pro can work like this.</p>
<p>Choose one music, you choose a lot of clips and then you can send all the stuff to Bitmark Pro to create a new timeline with the beats in sync with the music and then edit it in sync with the music and send the final result back to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Now Bitmark works all in one direction.</p>
<p>You create all the documents, you load the music, you load the assets into Bitmark Pro and then Bitmark Pro creates this timeline and then it sends it to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>And I say to myself it would be nice to understand, to learn how to send data from Final Cut Pro to my app, to my apps and then send them back.</p>
<p>And so I started doing a little research.</p>
<p>Everything started because I needed to do an automatic docking.</p>
<p>My first app was FCPX AutoDock.</p>
<p>It does automatic docking outside Final Cut Pro because you load the speaker track and then the audio, the music track and then it produces a new timeline with the audio, with the music track, with keyframes that lower the music and raise it up to make automatic docking.</p>
<p>So when there's someone speaking or talking, the music goes down and then after the speech, after the talking, the music returns up in a very elegant and seamless way.</p>
<p>It's not an automatic docking that works in one direction because it goes backwards.</p>
<p>It analyzes the clusters of the talking and then starts lowering the music before the talking.</p>
<p>It's something like it goes backward in time.</p>
<p>It can do this because it works on files and not in real time.</p>
<p>And I needed to do something like this and then I said to myself &quot;Ok, this is an app that is out since 2017.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It's one of my first apps I ever developed.</p>
<p>The interface is old, maybe ugly.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>It still sells today because it's useful.</p>
<p>But it will be super, super, super, super, super, super, super useful if it can work inside Final Cut Pro, take in a timeline with many dialogues, stuff and many musics and then do automatic docking on the complete timeline.</p>
<p>And I said to myself &quot;Ok, let's try to research this as a side-side project because I'm very focused to put out on the market FCP Postcutter that will be my super big app of the 2024 because it's a super big app.</p>
<p>It's super powerful.</p>
<p>But I said to myself &quot;Ok, let's do this some kind of side-side project while I'm working in the office of my wife.&quot; Doing this kind of stuff is hard.</p>
<p>It's very, very hard.</p>
<p>I tried to understand if there's some library, some framework on GitHub to parse the FCP XML because Final Cut Pro communicates with other apps via an XML.</p>
<p>A subset of an XML or an extension of XML, that is FCP XML.</p>
<p>Something like a complete and total description of what happens in the timeline, in the event, in the library.</p>
<p>Almost everything that you can think about can be described in this XML.</p>
<p>It's a very huge and complex file.</p>
<p>It's something like an old kind of file because today everything is done by a JSON.</p>
<p>But once, a lot of time ago, before the introduction of JSON, we used XML.</p>
<p>It's beautiful that today we have JSON because XML is a pain in the I know what and you know what.</p>
<p>So I start trying to understand if there's someone who developed something like a parser for doing this.</p>
<p>And then I said to myself, &quot;This thing is very complicated.&quot; Because think about a simple timeline, okay? You have a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p>You're doing something like an interview and then you have 10, 20, 50 little clips or segments of dialogue.</p>
<p>And then you have a background music.</p>
<p>So the music starts and then after 10 seconds of music, after the introduction, you have the first dialogue.</p>
<p>And then the music should go down and then should go up and that should go down to not interfere with the dialogue.</p>
<p>Then the dialogue finishes and then the music goes on for other 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The music goes up and then it fades out.</p>
<p>This is a very simple timeline.</p>
<p>To produce something like an automatic dacking, you have to do tons of stuff.</p>
<p>You have to recreate inside your app.</p>
<p>Inside my app I have to recreate the structure of the timeline with all the segments because you don't take a full clip without an in point or an out point.</p>
<p>You have to take dozens, hundreds of segments, shift them in time, understand if there's dialogue in this segment and then doing the same for the music or the musics, parsing what is dialogue and what is music but this can be done by other roles.</p>
<p>And then recreate a very complex structure of dialogues, segments of dialogues and music segments of music to produce this unique dialogue segment and a unique music segment, add keyframes and then send it back to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>It's not complex, it's almost impossible.</p>
<p>It's very, very hard and that's the reason nobody ever done an automatic dacking inside Final Cut Pro because it's hard.</p>
<p>And this is one of the easiest way of having a timeline.</p>
<p>What if you have a nested timeline, some compounds, secondary storylines, compounds with compounds of compounds, synchronized clip or if you do fade in and fade out of the music, crossfades.</p>
<p>There's a ton, a ton, a super ton of way of doing a single simple timeline, a common timeline, a normal timeline that you will do in your project.</p>
<p>And doing an automatic dacking for this is... it's a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I don't know how to do this.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do this as a personal research, to do dacking with maybe one or two, let's keep it simple, one or two musics and a bunch of clips in the main timeline without compounds, without synchronized clips or without multicam.</p>
<p>Trying to understand if this is feasible as a personal research.</p>
<p>Yesterday I put on Twitter &quot;okay I'm researching this kind of stuff with a version 2 of FCP Autodack&quot; and I showed the ideal icon of the app, an icon that I developed for an episode of my podcast, TechnoPills.</p>
<p>It's in Italian, sorry for everybody who doesn't understand Italian.</p>
<p>And because I developed an autodacking feature for my app Ultimedia Converter and it works, it's cool, it's powerful, it's... yeah! Using artificial intelligence Firefly by Adobe I created this icon with a dack with a lot of speakers and it's beautiful.</p>
<p>And so I said to myself if I'll ever do an automatic dack, a version 2 of autodacking, I will use this as an icon.</p>
<p>So I think this is a some kind of a joke because I'm quite sure that I will never do an app that can do this in a seamless way, in an efficient way, in some way, because it's too hard to produce an automatic dacking.</p>
<p>Think about it, even Apple didn't do an automatic dacking for Final Cut Pro because there's so much you have to understand, to learn, to figure out.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible.</p>
<p>But they should do this.</p>
<p>I expect this is an upcoming version of Final Cut Pro but I'm working with an automatic dacking feature since 10.4 and now we have 10.7.</p>
<p>A huge improvement with the scrolling timeline for you! And no automatic dacking.</p>
<p>I don't know, sometimes I think that FCP is a die-hard platform but I keep it to myself because I base all my business on Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Well, I think that's all for today.</p>
<p>Now I have to run in the rain in my car towards Milan because I have a pre-production meeting for a very very very super strong low-budget product production that I don't want to do.</p>
<p>And I said to myself, you know, never accept this kind of works anymore because working with so little margins and with clients is so demanding, with an arrogant way.</p>
<p>It's something that hurts my stomach and then I need a lot of malox to survive.</p>
<p>Ok, that's it, now I run to this meeting and cross your finger for me and I'll keep you updated with the things that I will discover in my research trying to understand how Final Cut Pro thinks using XML.</p>
<p>It's 2023 and everybody should not use XML anymore.</p>
<p>That's all for today and as always I say... Ciao! Oh, remember to comment this video, like this video, subscribe to the channel, blah blah blah, all the stuff that all the good YouTubers do.</p>
<p>I don't do this because I'm not a YouTuber, I'm a podcaster.</p>
<p>This is just a video podcast.</p>
<p>I know that it will be more, more, more interesting doing this as an audiophile but you know what, I'm trying to experiment.</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a great video, and it's inspired me to reply in more depth, here at FCP Cafe...</p>
<p>I absolutely love all of Alex's tool - I have personally bought them all, and use them all the time - especially <a href="https://ulti.media/transcriber/">Transcriber</a>, <a href="https://ulti.media/beatmark-pro-automatic-music-driven-video-editing-for-final-cut-pro/">BeatMark Pro</a> and <a href="https://ulti.media/fcp-srt-importer-2/">FCP SRT Importer 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, one complaint I've always had is that Alex's tools don't use <strong>Workflow Extensions</strong>.</p>
<p>A Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension is a feature in Apple's Final Cut Pro that allows <strong>third-party developers</strong> to integrate their tools and services directly into the Final Cut Pro interface, enhancing the functionality and efficiency of the editing process.</p>
<p>They provide <strong>seamless integration</strong> as they appear as panels within the Final Cut Pro interface. This means editors can use third-party tools and services without leaving Final Cut Pro, maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted editing workflow. Their window position also gets saved in any saved Workspaces.</p>
<p>There is a diverse range of applications, and can vary widely in function, including tools for media asset management, stock footage libraries, music services, transcription services, and more. This variety allows editors to tailor their workflow according to their specific needs.</p>
<p>You can find Workflow Extensions on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/story/id1439356777">Mac App Store</a>, but they can also be released outside of the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>FCP Cafe keeps track of all the available Workflow Extensions <a href="https://fcp.cafe/ecosystem/workflowextensions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>By having these additional tools integrated directly into the editing environment, editors can save time and effort. Tasks like searching for media, managing files, or transcribing audio can be done quickly and efficiently within Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>I personally have a LOT of Workflow Extensions installed:</p>
<p><img src="/static/workflow-extensions.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>From a developers perspective, a Workflow Extension is basically just a <strong>custom view</strong> that you can put whatever you like inside it.</p>
<p>When you drag something from the Final Cut Pro Browser to any text box (i.e. TextEdit), what it's actually dragging is FCPXML data (try it yourself to see).</p>
<p>Because of this, you can easily drag objects from the Final Cut Pro Browser to your Workflow Extension, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For example, in <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a> you can drag your markers from the Workflow Extension back into your Final Cut Pro timeline as a Compound Clip (drag the green icon):</p>
<p><img src="/static/marker-toolbox-workflow-extension.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a> once you've imported all your BRAW footage, you can drag an <strong>Event</strong> from the Workflow Extension back into your <strong>Library</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/static/braw-toolbox-workflow-extension.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also drag <strong>Libraries</strong>, <strong>Events</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong> back into the Workflow Extension via the Toolbox at the bottom of the user interface, for doing things like exporting a FCPXML for DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p>You can also trigger a limited number of things via the Workflow Extension API.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/workflow_extensions/interacting_with_the_final_cut_pro_timeline#3530647">Observe Changes in the Final Cut Pro Timeline</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional_video_applications/workflow_extensions/interacting_with_the_final_cut_pro_timeline#3530640">Move the Playhead Position</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We use this API to allow CommandPost to programatically move the playhead via the CommandPost Workflow Extension:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-workflow-extension.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This Workflow Extension is super simple - it's just in Objective-C, and uses web-sockets to communicate back and forth between the Workflow Extension and CommandPost.</p>
<p>You can check out the source code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost-App/tree/master/CommandPost%20Workflow%20Extension">here</a>.</p>
<p>Controlling the playhead via the API is a lot smoother and reliable than pressing virtual shortcut keys, or triggering menubar items.</p>
<p>But aside from that - that's really all Workflow Extensions can do. They're just a dumb window that a developer can control essentially.</p>
<p>In fact, we decided NOT to use a Workflow Extension for the CommandPost HUD - because there was really no advantage:</p>
<p><img src="/static/commandpost-hud.png" alt=""></p>
<p>However, jumping back to Alex's video - I'd LOVE for <a href="https://ulti.media/transcriber/">Transcriber</a> and <a href="https://ulti.media/beatmark-pro-automatic-music-driven-video-editing-for-final-cut-pro/">BeatMark Pro</a> to be quickly accessible from directly within Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to just drag in an music track from the <strong>Browser</strong> into a Workflow Extension, do the processing, then drag the clip back into my timeline with markers added.</p>
<p>This is all possible, and somewhat easy to do.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Workflow Extensions on FCP Cafe <a href="https://fcp.cafe/developers/workflowextensions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But Workflow Extensions are only one technology that third party Final Cut Pro developers get access to...</p>
<p>There's also <strong>Custom Share Destinations</strong>, which is something I've been digging into deeply recently, to help out Vigneswaran Rajkumar for his exciting upcoming app, <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmVigneswaran/status/1723873174956171668">Marker Data</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, Custom Share Destinations are terribly documented.</p>
<p>Essentially they're a way to &quot;trigger&quot; external apps once a render/export is complete - for example, this shows how <strong>Xsend Motion</strong> is triggered:</p>
<p><img src="/static/xsend-motion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro sends Apple Events to the third party application - and there's back and forth communication between Final Cut Pro and the third party app.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I happened to have a very old Apple sample project saved in my backups that demonstrates how this works - which has since sadly disappeared from the Internet.</p>
<p>I've uploaded the Objective-C example <a href="https://github.com/latenitefilms/ShareDestinationKit/tree/main/Examples/SimpleAssetManagerSample">here</a>.</p>
<p>I've also started attempting to port this example to a more modern Swift - but it's early days. You can track my progress <a href="https://github.com/latenitefilms/ShareDestinationKit">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Custom Share Destinations on FCP Cafe <a href="https://fcp.cafe/developers/customsharedestination/">here</a>.</p>
<p>And last, but not least, we have <strong>FxPlug</strong>.</p>
<p>FxPlug is a powerful plugin architecture designed by Apple, specifically tailored for Final Cut Pro and Motion.</p>
<p>At its core, FxPlug enables third-party developers to create advanced effects, such as custom filters, transitions, and generators, expanding the capabilities of Final Cut Pro beyond its native features.</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of FxPlug is its support for high-bit-depth rendering, ensuring that the effects and transitions maintain the highest image quality without degradation. This is particularly important for professionals who require precision and high fidelity in their video projects. Additionally, FxPlug offers real-time performance, a crucial aspect for efficient workflow, allowing editors and motion graphic designers to preview effects without the need for time-consuming rendering.</p>
<p>Another significant aspect of FxPlug is its compatibility with Apple's Metal framework. This integration leverages the full power of modern Mac hardware, delivering accelerated performance and smoother playback, even with complex effects and high-resolution footage. The use of Metal also means that FxPlug plugins can harness the capabilities of the latest graphic processors, further enhancing the efficiency and speed of video editing tasks.</p>
<p>It provides a wide range of customizable parameters for each plugin, giving users complete control over the look and feel of the effects. This level of customization allows for greater creative freedom, enabling editors to achieve unique visual styles tailored to their specific project needs.</p>
<p>FxPlug is a robust and versatile plugin architecture that significantly enhances the capabilities of Final Cut Pro and Motion. Its support for high-bit-depth rendering, real-time performance, integration with Apple's Metal, and customizable options make it an essential tool for video editing professionals seeking to create high-quality, creative, and visually stunning projects.</p>
<p>Essentially though... FxPlug is basically just <strong>Filters</strong> &amp; <strong>Generators</strong> for Apple Motion:</p>
<p><img src="/static/motion-filters-and-generators.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can't <strong>directly</strong> use a FxPlug in Final Cut Pro - you need to make an Apple Motion template that uses it.</p>
<p><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a> and <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> both use FxPlug under the hood.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the BRAW Toolbox Motion Template:</p>
<p><img src="/static/braw-toolbox-motion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here's a look at the Gyroflow Toolbox Motion Template:</p>
<p><img src="/static/gyroflow-toolbox-motion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Gyroflow Toolbox is open source, so you can view the source code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox/tree/main/Source">here</a>.</p>
<p>FxPlug is fairly flexible in that you can add your own custom parameters, and basically do whatever you want to the image.</p>
<p>I'm currently building a new app called <strong>Metaburner Pro</strong> which is using FxPlug on Swift:</p>
<p><img src="/static/metaburner-pro.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can learn more about FxPlug over at FCP Cafe <a href="https://fcp.cafe/developers/fxplug/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can find a list of third party Motion Templates (some of which use FxPlug) <a href="https://fcp.cafe/ecosystem/motiontemplates/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ok, so you have <strong>Workflow Extensions</strong>, <strong>Custom Share Destinations</strong>, <strong>FCPXML</strong> and <strong>FxPlug</strong>.</p>
<p>There are third party frameworks for dealing with FCPXML too...</p>
<p><strong>Pipeline Neo</strong> is a Swift framework for working with FCPXML files easily.</p>
<p>Originally developed by Reuel Kim and it is no longer maintained. Pipeline Neo was created as a spin-off project to fix and update the library when necessary.</p>
<p>You can learn more <a href="https://github.com/TheAcharya/pipeline-neo">here</a>. I've personally never really used it.</p>
<p>There's also <strong>DAWFileKit</strong> - a Swift library for reading and writing common import/export file formats between popular DAW and video editing applications with the ability to convert between formats.</p>
<p>DAWFileKit is made by <a href="https://github.com/orchetect">Steffan Andrews</a>, who is an absolute genius.</p>
<p>I've never personally used DAWFileKit, but I intend to play soon.</p>
<p>You can learn more <a href="https://github.com/orchetect/DAWFileKit">here</a>.</p>
<p>You also have <strong>Audio Units</strong> - which are basically system wide audio plugins that work in ProTools, Adobe Audition, Logic Pro, etc. You can use Audio Units on both Mac and iPad/iOS, which is interesting.</p>
<p>I've never personally played too much with Audio Units, as it's a GIANT rabbit hole, as you can see from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/audiounit/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Finally going back to Alex's video...</p>
<p>I totally think that <a href="https://ulti.media/transcriber/">Transcriber</a> and <a href="https://ulti.media/beatmark-pro-automatic-music-driven-video-editing-for-final-cut-pro/">BeatMark Pro</a> could easily be ported to a Workflow Extension and improved to make it simpler and easier for Final Cut Pro editors.</p>
<p>In terms of bringing <a href="https://ulti.media/fcpxautoduck/">FCPX AutoDuck</a> to a Workflow Extension, that's definitely possible too, but as Alex explains, you'd basically need to recreate Final Cut Pro's entire audio pipeline to mimic what Final Cut Pro does in FCPX AutoDuck.</p>
<p>One potential workaround could be to create a Custom Share Destination, allowing you to export AIFFs of dialogue, music and effects separately, and then the Workflow Extension uses these mix downs for the processing, and then applies the audio adjustments to a Compound Clip of all the audio clips in that role.</p>
<p>Because you can create a <strong>Custom Share Destination</strong> that can export roles as seperate audio files, the user would just need to export to a single Share Destination, then at the end of the export/render, you could programatically send these files to the Workflow Extension for processing. Once processing is complete, the user could drag a new project from the Workflow Extension to their Final Cut Pro Browser, which would have Compound Clips of the individual audio roles, and levels/effects applied to those compound clips.</p>
<p>It's slightly complex - because you need to communicate between the Custom Share Destination and the Workflow Extension, but certainly achievable.</p>
<p><img src="/static/export-roles.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But I totally agree with Alex in that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia/cmtime-u58">CMTime</a> is really hard and FCPXML can get insanely confusing.</p>
<p>For example, this is how we get the &quot;current frame number&quot; in Gyroflow Toolbox and BRAW Toolbox:</p>
<pre><code class="language-objc">//---------------------------------------------------------
// Load the timing API:
//---------------------------------------------------------
id&lt;FxTimingAPI_v4&gt; timingAPI = [_apiManager apiForProtocol:@protocol(FxTimingAPI_v4)];
if (timingAPI == nil) {
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    // Show error message:
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    NSString *errorMessage = @&quot;Unable to retrieve FxTimingAPI_v4 in pluginStateAtTime.&quot;;
    NSLog(@&quot;[Gyroflow Toolbox Renderer] %@&quot;, errorMessage);
    if (error != NULL) {
        *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:FxPlugErrorDomain
                                     code:kFxError_FailedToLoadTimingAPI
                                 userInfo:@{
            NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : errorMessage }];
    }
    return NO;
}

//---------------------------------------------------------
// Load the Parameter Retrieval API:
//---------------------------------------------------------
id&lt;FxParameterRetrievalAPI_v6&gt; paramGetAPI = [_apiManager apiForProtocol:@protocol(FxParameterRetrievalAPI_v6)];
if (paramGetAPI == nil) {
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    // Show error message:
    //---------------------------------------------------------
    NSString *errorMessage = @&quot;Unable to retrieve FxParameterRetrievalAPI_v6 in pluginStateAtTime.&quot;;
    NSLog(@&quot;[Gyroflow Toolbox Renderer] %@&quot;, errorMessage);
    if (error != NULL) {
        *error = [NSError errorWithDomain:FxPlugErrorDomain
                                     code:kFxError_FailedToLoadParameterGetAPI
                                 userInfo:@{
            NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : errorMessage }];
    }
    return NO;
}

//---------------------------------------------------------
// Create a new Parameters &quot;holder&quot;:
//---------------------------------------------------------
GyroflowParameters *params = [[[GyroflowParameters alloc] init] autorelease];

//---------------------------------------------------------
// Get the frame to render:
//---------------------------------------------------------
CMTime timelineFrameDuration = kCMTimeZero;
timelineFrameDuration = CMTimeMake( [timingAPI timelineFpsDenominatorForEffect:self],
                                   (int)[timingAPI timelineFpsNumeratorForEffect:self] );

CMTime timelineTime = kCMTimeZero;
[timingAPI timelineTime:&amp;timelineTime fromInputTime:renderTime];

CMTime startTimeOfInputToFilter = kCMTimeZero;
[timingAPI startTimeForEffect:&amp;startTimeOfInputToFilter];

CMTime startTimeOfInputToFilterInTimelineTime = kCMTimeZero;
[timingAPI timelineTime:&amp;startTimeOfInputToFilterInTimelineTime fromInputTime:startTimeOfInputToFilter];

Float64 timelineTimeMinusStartTimeOfInputToFilterNumerator = (Float64)timelineTime.value * (Float64)startTimeOfInputToFilterInTimelineTime.timescale - (Float64)startTimeOfInputToFilterInTimelineTime.value * (Float64)timelineTime.timescale;
Float64 timelineTimeMinusStartTimeOfInputToFilterDenominator = (Float64)timelineTime.timescale * (Float64)startTimeOfInputToFilterInTimelineTime.timescale;

Float64 frame = ( ((Float64)timelineTimeMinusStartTimeOfInputToFilterNumerator / (Float64)timelineTimeMinusStartTimeOfInputToFilterDenominator) / ((Float64)timelineFrameDuration.value / (Float64)timelineFrameDuration.timescale) );

//---------------------------------------------------------
// Calculate the Timestamp:
//---------------------------------------------------------
Float64 timelineFpsNumerator    = [timingAPI timelineFpsNumeratorForEffect:self];
Float64 timelineFpsDenominator  = [timingAPI timelineFpsDenominatorForEffect:self];
Float64 frameRate               = timelineFpsNumerator / timelineFpsDenominator;
Float64 timestamp               = (frame / frameRate) * 1000000.0;
params.timestamp                = [[[NSNumber alloc] initWithFloat:timestamp] autorelease];

<p>HUGE props to Dr Gregory Clarke for all the INSANE work he does with FCPXML - again, another absolute genius. It's a LOT of work - just look at how many updates XtoCC and SendToX have had over the years!</p>
<p>Hope this extended &quot;rant&quot; is useful! Any questions, please leave them in the Discussion below. Thanks team!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gyroflow Toolbox v1.1.4 (Build 18)</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>It includes the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>🔨 Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've updated to the <a href="https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow/commit/2b3332dd2631d7ac0aa6e9d0d313db5f308bc386">latest</a> Gyroflow Core Renderer. HUGE thank you to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/AdrianEddy">AdrianEddy</a> for all his ongoing help, assistance, genius and support! There should be a minor performance improvement to playback, and slightly lower memory usage.</li>
<li>Updated from FxPlug <code>v4.2.7</code> to <code>v4.2.9</code>.</li>
<li>3156 lens profiles have been added from the hero Gyroflow project. Thanks to EVERYONE who has submitted lens profiles and another HUGE thank you to <a href="https://github.com/AdrianEddy">AdrianEddy</a> for all the work that goes into managing them.</li>
<li>We now load all lens profile when the FxPlug first starts, for faster importing later.</li>
<li>We now show a loading popup when a Gyroflow project is being imported or generated for Final Cut Pro, so it's obvious that something is busy behind the scenes.</li>
<li>We've added a <strong>Grant Sandbox Access</strong> and <strong>Reset Sandbox Access</strong> menu items to the <strong>Settings</strong> button in the Inspector, so that you can grant Gyroflow Toolbox access to an entire drive, for faster importing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>🐞 Bug Fix:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a potential crash that we've been trying to solve for ages. On SOME systems (specifically systems with Mac2 family GPUs), Apple's Metal Framework would generate a Metal Texture that the Metal Performance Shader in the Mac couldn't actually work with, causing a crash deep within Apple's code. It was very hard to reproduce, as it only happened on certain systems - and none of ours. HUGE thank you to Apple Developer Technical Support, the Final Cut Pro Team, AdrianEddy and Warren Moore for all their constant and on-going help, assistance, guidance, patience and support!</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Carsten Kurpanek</strong> posted this <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurpanek/status/1738060141285494817">really interesting Tweet</a> on his Twitter feed:</p>
<p><img src="/static/tgwtdt-twitter.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>It's worth having a look through the entire thread, as Carsten gives a lot of interesting insights into this fun workflow.</p>
<p>It reminds me when I was back in film school in 2008, working on my <strong>SAKOOZ</strong> feature film proof-of-concept, which we shot on an early RED ONE.</p>
<p>Inspired by this Tweet, here's an old blog post I wrote back in December 2008:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we first started thinking about the best way to put together the Sakooz trailer, we originally thought that Super 16mm and a film scan route would be the most appropriate option given our budget, and the “Hollywood trailer” look that we were after. However, after various camera tests (we’ll post some further information on these tests another time), and a bit of number crunching, it became clear pretty quickly that shooting on the RED ONE was going to achieve better results, cost less and make the post production just that little bit easier (at least in theory) by keeping everything digital. And so, after getting in touch with Cail &amp; Pete from Inspiration Studios, and doing some tests with their brand new toy camera – we decided to shoot the Sakooz trailer on RED.</p>
<p>In terms of Principle Photography, everything pretty much ran exactly the same as if we were shooting on film. We lit it exactly the same way, and Ben (our DOP) still had his light meter by his side. Because we needed to shoot so much very quickly (time wasn’t on our side), I decided against setting up a “video village” and even a directors monitor – preferring to be there in the action, behind Ben, peaking over his shoulder to watch the on-camera LCD. This worked really well.</p>
<p>Although the plan was always to shoot to card for safety reasons (we’ve all got disaster stories to tell about Firestore’s dying and hard drives being dropped!) – we decided to gamble and record straight to the RED-DRIVE (a special drive designed for the camera which can store 320GB in a RAID 0 configuration). Not only that – but we decided to leave the dumping to the end of the day. This was a HUGE risk, because if the drive died at the end of the day, we’d potentially loose a whole days worth of shooting. However, we didn’t have the crew available to have a dedicated “data technician”, nor did we have the hardware to dump the cards on a regular basis. This may seem really silly (I mean seriously – all you need is a Mac laptop and a card reader!), but we had neither of those things at the time, and it was just easier to use what we had available. Luckily – nothing went wrong, and the RED-DRIVE was faultless – it never dropped a single frame! However, to anyone else planning to shoot on RED – I strongly recommend you do the complete opposite to what we did! Record to CF card and dump as soon as the card is full.</p>
<p>Although in the end we didn’t end up using any of the sync audio – we recorded audio separately to a Sound Devices 744T, which was synced to a Smart Slate. Originally we had planned to sync the camera to the 744T as well, but for some reason we couldn’t get it to work on the first day of shooting, so we gave up. I believe the problem has since been fixed with one of the RED ONE Firmware Updates. We only had one microphone on set – a Sennheiser 416 on a boom. We basically just recorded sound to use as a guide track for when it came to adding sound effects later on.</p>
<p>At the end of each shooting day we dumped the RED-DRIVE and the 744T to two seperate 1TB SATAII drives. For the duration of the shoot we managed to borrow a brand new MacPro Tower from Julian at Eidolon Creative and used this machine to do all the dumping as well as the transcoding. We put the two 1TB drives directly into the MacPro. We ended up with 508.34GB of camera footage, and a couple of GB of audio. We ended up purchasing two additional 500GB SATAII drives to make another backup of all of the R3D files – which we then stored at two separate locations away from our master edit suite, just in case. We called the drives Pinky (Master Edit), Bluey (Backup of Master Edit), Tumbles (R3D Master) and Splash (backup of R3D Master), because that’s what the names of the Sakooz creatures are called. Anyway… Now normally, on a “proper” production, you would have RAIDs and RAID 5 protection, etc. But unfortunately, we simply didn’t have the money for that, so we just had to make do with what we had. We had to manually copy and paste the files for backup purposes – we basically did this at the end of each day. We also kept a copy of the Final Cut Pro project on two USB thumbdrives just in case. Just for laughs, here’s a photo of some of the drives from our rather odd-ball collection. The top right one is Pinky. We ended up taking the covers off the enclosures as we found they got too hot when in use all day and night long.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-hard-drives.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After principle photography was wrapped we set the MacPro to work trancoding the R3D files using REDrushes (a free application which can be downloaded from the RED site). We were transcoding the R3D files to Apple ProRes 422 HQ files at 1920×1080. We were using the full debayer quality, and REDSpace for both the Colour &amp; Gamma spaces. This took a HUGE amount of time (almost two weeks of none stop processing), but at the end of the day we ended up with some terrific Quicktime files that we could throw into Final Cut Pro and start editing, plus we could also send these clips to the visual effects kids so that they could start playing. We did run into one slight problem after we THOUGHT that everything was done. On inspection of the transcoded files, we realised that all the Quicktimes for Day Two of shooting were EXACTLY the same as Day Four. I’m still not sure whether that was human error or REDrushes being annoying – but either way we had to re-transcode all of the day four footage. Unfortunately at this stage we had to give back the MacPro, so we had to do all of this on a stock standard first generation MacBook. It wasn’t quite as fast as the MacPro, but it got the job done. Eventually.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-red-rushes.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-quicktime.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Offlining using such high quality media may seem a little silly – I mean, really, we could have done a quarter res transcode to DV, and save a huge amount of time and disk space. Also, considering we were doing the offline on a bunch of eMac’s over Firewire 400 drives (that’s right… really old school eMac’s!), it would have also made the whole editing process a lot more fluid. However! By editing at such a great quality, it meant that whenever we did test screenings or had to show potential investors or sponsors, we could easily burn off a high-quality 1920×1080 Quicktime Movie that looks simply gorgeous even before grading. Here is a photo of our main editing machine.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-emac.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>...and the other babies:</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-emac-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-emac-3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m not even sure how this is possible, but we were able to play one video track of 1920×1080 ProRes on the eMac over Firewire 400 in realtime without any issues. And so, we basically edited away for several weeks in Final Cut Pro 6. We ended up doing a very rough grade using the 3-way Colour Corrector just so that when we showed other people to get opinions, they were looking at something that looked half decent. We tried a huge amount of different things in terms of the edit – we used a lot of different music as guide tracks. We even copied the audio from other big Hollywood trailers (such as the Dark Knight) and cut our footage to their soundtrack just to see what we could come up with. It was a very painful, long, but fun and creative process that I certainly won’t forget any time soon!</p>
<p>Whilst I was trying to lock down the picture, others were playing around with the visual effects. Initially, tests and trials were done by the various VFX artists using the ProRes Quicktime files. However, once we had locked down the trailer in terms of the edit, we used REDCINE to export out 4K TIFF sequences and 2K/1K DPX sequences for the visual effects people to work on. Ashley Smart (who did the effects for the Shed Explosion Sequence) was using 4K TIFF Sequences in After Effects on a laptop (which is quite incredible). James Otter used 1K DPX sequences in Nuke, and After Effects to achieve a lot of the effects shots, on a PC. And I used a good old MacBook, running After Effects and Shake to do the remaining shots. I ended up using After Effect’s own tracker for most of the tracking work, although I did use PFTrack for one of the shots. I also used Syntheyes on an old Dell Laptop for a small section of another shot. For Pinky eyes, I ended up brining in 4K DPX sequences into After Effects – which was fairly interesting on the poor old MacBook! But it worked, and the shots came out OK considering…</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-macbook.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We ended up with 16 visual effects in total (including graphics). Once a visual effect shot was completed it was exported as a 1920×1080 DPX sequence ready for grading. For your viewing pleasure, here are some photos of After Effects genius James Otter, working away! I have no idea what the cardboard cartons are for, or where he got them. Needless to say, these photos were taken at some ridiculous early hour of the morning, after James and I had been stuck at uni for AT LEAST forty hours STRAIGHT!</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-james-otter.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-james-otter-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once the offline edit was complete, we tidied up the timeline so that everything was on the one track (where possible) and printed off an EDL. This then became our bible. At this stage, all the audio had been done in Final Cut Pro, with the occasional effect being done in Protools LE and Soundtrack Pro, and then exported out as an AIFF. We were still using guide track music.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-edl.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>By printing off the EDL we now had a hard copy of the trailer’s edit – which is always a good thing! But more importantly, it allowed us to easily track and manage everything. Because we couldn’t afford to purchase software such as Crimson Workflow, and we didn’t have time to write up our own proprietary software, we ended up doing a lot of things manually. For instance, we ended up going down the EDL line by line, and exporting a 1920×1080 DPX sequence from REDCINE. We made minor adjustments in REDCINE to get the most clean image and exported away. We put each shot in a different folder based on the EDL number assigned to the shot. For example, the first shot in the trailer was called 001_000001.DPX. This kept things nice and simple. Once every shot was exported out of REDCINE as DPX sequence (which took a night), it was ready for grading!</p>
<p>Originally we had planned to do the grade at one of the major post houses in Melbourne, but due to a lack of time and money, we ended up getting a very talented film school graduate called Nick Reid to do the grade in Apple’s Color. Getting the DPX files into Color proved to be a bit more tricky than anticipated! We ended up purchasing yet another 1TB SATAII drive (called Gizmo) for the colour grade.</p>
<p>What we ended up doing was wrapping all the DPX files as Quicktimes manually using AJA’s free DPXtoQTTranslator utility. Once all of the DPX’s were wrapped (including all the visual effects), we manually re-created the Final Cut Pro timeline based on the printed EDL using the newly wrapped Quicktime files. We then exported out a XML file from Final Cut Pro. This XML file was brought into Color and grading could commence. Nick took a couple of days to do the grade, and once completed, he handed back Gizmo, ready for the final stages!</p>
<p>With the grade now completed, we exported out AJA 10-bit Uncompressed RGB Quicktimes. We then used the AJA QTtoDPXTranslator to unwrap the Quicktime Files back to DPX files. As the AJA tool simply “wraps” the files – it doesn’t transcode them or anything like that, this process is really fast, although you do have to do it manually. For me, that means I have to do everything 69 times which isn’t too bad. The only annoying thing is that you have to rename all the clips again, as Color names everything sequentially, and we wanted everything named as per the bible (i.e. the EDL).</p>
<p>Now with a whole heap of beautifully graded DPX sequences, it was time to do the online. I ended up doing this at University on a nice and speedy MacPro in After Effects CS3. I imported all of the DPX sequences, and then manually put them all in the correct places based on the printed EDL. Once that was complete I simply rendered out a Quicktime File using the Animation Codec. Here is a photo taken at about four o’clock in the morning after I’d been at uni for about fourty hours STRAIGHT working on Sakooz. You can see the insanity in my eyes.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sakooz-chris.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The only thing left to do was sound! Once Frank (our composer) finished, he simply gave us a 24-Bit 48KHz Broadcast Wave File, which we threw into Final Cut Pro. After a bit of tweaking – adjusting the sound effect levels to suit the new score, the sound was ready to rock and roll! Originally we had planned to do a quite complex 5.1 mix just for fun – but at the end of the day, no one was ever going to listen to it in surround sound anyway, so we decided to skip on that idea (for now at least). Once the sound was done, we exported an AIFF and then merged the Animation Codec video and AIFF together to create the Final Quicktime Master!</p>
<p>From that Quicktime master we than could do any DVD, web, Blu-ray, etc. encodes using Compressor.</p>
<p>And that is the workflow we decided to use for Sakooz! At the moment we are just archiving all the project files to DVD, and keeping all the media on the SATAII drives. At some stage we will eventually put everything to LTO drives as a final backup – but we don’t have the money at the moment.</p>
<p>This wasn’t exactly the quickest workflow in the world (we did a lot of things manually that could have been easily avoided by using software such as Crimson Workflow, plus we used extremely old Mac’s and PC’s in a lot of cases), but a lot of it came down to money vs time. In some cases money won out, but more often than not, we decided to save money and do things the manual way. To be perfectly honest, it actually felt really nice to have a printed out EDL on which to direct everything! It felt much the same as the good old days with film!</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the workflow or how we did anything, feel free to post a comment. At some stage in the future we also hope to post some more detailed information on the various visual effects that featured in the trailer, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Chris!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[19th January 2024]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first news post on FCP Cafe for 2024! Woohoo!</p>
<p>I know we're already 19 days into 2024, however rest assured, it's already been a very busy and exciting start to the year for the Final Cut Pro community!</p>
<p>For starters, we've just added a <strong>new case study</strong> about the <a href="/case-studies/blood-and-gold-vfx/">Blood &amp; Gold VFX Workflow</a>.</p>
<p>We've also already released <strong>32 beta builds</strong> of our latest app, <a href="https://metaburner.pro">Metaburner</a> on FxFactory.</p>
<p>Why FxFactory? You can read more about our decision <a href="https://metaburner.pro/faq/#why-fxfactory">here</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone who missed it, <strong>Metaburner</strong> is an Advanced Metadata Generator for Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>It's a serious high-end professional tool, used by high-end feature film and television editors on projects for Netflix, etc.</p>
<p>!!!success Download Now!
You can download Metaburner via FxFactory <a href="https://fxfactory.com/install/metaburner">here</a>.
!!!</p>
<p>You can access it via a <strong>Title</strong> in the Titles sidebar.</p>
<p>Metaburner gives you <strong>25 text layers</strong> that you can populate with whatever metadata you want.</p>
<p>You can even stack multiple Metaburner Titles on top of each other for <strong>unlimited</strong> metadata fields!</p>
<p>To begin, simply drag your Final Cut Pro Project from the Browser into the Metaburner Title Inspector via a drop zone, and then Metaburner has full access to everything that's in the FCPXML.</p>
<p>There's also a <strong>Lua scripting environment</strong> built-in, so you can even &quot;code&quot; your own text for unlimited possibilities.</p>
<p>You can even share Lua variables between multiple Metaburner titles for some crazy cool workflows!</p>
<p>Metaburner is currently in a public beta testing phase. You can download a free watermarked version from FxFactory, and you can also purchase to remove the watermark.</p>
<p><img src="/static/metaburner-20240119.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We've also started building another application called <strong>LUT Robot</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/lut-robot.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The above icon was designed by the amazing <a href="http://matthewskiles.com">Matthew Skiles</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Final Cut Pro's built-in Custom LUT and Camera LUT tools, LUT Robot allows you to &quot;link&quot; to a LUT stored in any folder.</p>
<p>It also allows you to apply LUTs in bulk to clips - for example, if you have a unique LUT for each of your rushes files.</p>
<p>LUT Robot is currently in active development. We hope to release a beta on FxFactory in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Looking back at 2023, it's pretty amazing to see what we've achieved...</p>
<p>On <strong>26th May 2023</strong> we decided to repurpose our <strong>Final Cut Pro Bug Tracker</strong> into <strong>FCP Cafe</strong>.</p>
<p>We launched the site with an awesome case study - <a href="/case-studies/turn-of-the-tide/">Turn of the Tide</a>.</p>
<p>We've since added a HUGE amount of information to FCP Cafe, including awesome case studies, developer case studies and highly technical information that you can't find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Our Bug Tracker has become the go-to resource for reporting and fault finding bugs in Final Cut Pro. We've been able to fix and solve several Final Cut Pro issues via this site, and have allowed Final Cut Pro users to connect with the Apple ProApps team - something that never really happened until now.</p>
<p>On <strong>25th October 2023</strong> we were very sad to learn that fcp.co had <a href="https://fcp.cafe/news/20231025/">disappeared from the Internet</a>, making FCP Cafe the new home for professional Final Cut Pro Editors.</p>
<p>Peter did such an incredible job with fcp.co, so it's quite a weight of responsibility for FCP Cafe. However, we're up for the challenge!</p>
<p>We've started slowing bringing back some older fcp.co articles - for example, today we're bringing back the <a href="/case-studies/neighbours">Neighbours - Erinsborough High</a> case study written by the incredible Ronny Courtens.</p>
<p>One of the best things about FCP Cafe, it's that's it's an open, community driven site. Anyone can <a href="https://fcp.cafe/contribute/">contribute</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/graphs/contributors">11 other video editors</a> so far have taken up the challenge to learn GitHub and have contributed directly to FCP Cafe.</p>
<p>I've personally made over <strong>801 commits</strong> to FCP Cafe so far.</p>
<p>Powered by <a href="https://retype.com">Retype</a> on <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe">GitHub</a>, all the &quot;back end&quot; stuff is also completely open - you can even &quot;fork&quot; the site, and take our design and GitHub scripts for your own purposes!</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://sequence.film/docs/">Sequence's Docs</a> website is a fork of FCP Cafe.</p>
<p>In 2023 we attended the FCP Creative Summit and documented our adventures on FCP Cafe:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/news/20231106/">Day 1</a></li>
<li><a href="/news/20231107/">Day 2</a></li>
<li><a href="/news/20231108/">Day 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We're hopeful that the FCP Creative Summit will come back in 2024, and we'll be able to cover it again.</p>
<p>In other exciting news <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> has now been downloaded over <strong>200K</strong> times!</p>
<p>We've already pushed out two CommandPost updates in January 2024, and managed to do 8 updates in 2023. We'll continue to build-on and improve CommandPost this year.</p>
<p>It's pretty amazing to think that 2023 was also the first year we took the plunge into developing paid applications.</p>
<p>On <strong>30th January 2023</strong> we released <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a> onto the Mac App Store - our first paid application.</p>
<p>There were LOTS of very smart people that told me that adding native BRAW support to Final Cut Pro would be impossible, but we made it happen, and BRAW Toolbox has now been downloaded over <strong>1.98K</strong> times.</p>
<p>Next up, with the support of the incredible <a href="https://github.com/AdrianEddy">AdrianEddy</a>, we brought <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> to the world. It's now been downloaded over <strong>1.36K</strong> times.</p>
<p>We then brought <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a> to the world. It's now been downloaded 112 times - which is a shame because it's so darn handy! If you haven't already tried it, please look into it.</p>
<p><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a> is a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension that acts as a Shared Pasteboard. Anything that you can copy and paste in Final Cut Pro, Recall Toolbox can store. It's only been download 24 times, however those 24 users are extremely passionate about it, and seem to really love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://fastcollections.io">Fast Collections</a> is a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension that allows you to quickly create a Smart Collection from a list of Keywords.</p>
<p>When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as feature-length documentaries with hundreds of clips and thousands of keywords, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.</p>
<p>This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new Smart Collection, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.</p>
<p>If you have thousands of keywords across many events, it can take a long time to create a new Smart Collection with your preferred keywords directly within Final Cut Pro - but with Fast Collections, it can now take seconds.</p>
<p>You can also Generate a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc. This is very handy for long-form projects.</p>
<p>To be honest, we originally only built this application, to help out a single documentary filmmaker, but it's since been downloaded 19 times.</p>
<p>To make it cheaper and easier to purchase our Mac App Store Apps, we also introduced a bundle.</p>
<p>For only <strong>USD$100</strong> (save USD$49.95!), you can now buy <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://fastcollections.io">Fast Collections</a> as a bundle!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>evrExpanse v4.2.0</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>Here's their press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>evrExpanse 4.2.0 Ushers in a New Era of Media Management with Enhanced Offload Engine
Milan, January 9, 2024 – EVRapp, a leading innovator in metadata-centric applications for videomakers, proudly announces the release of evrExpanse 4.2.0, a groundbreaking update that transforms the landscape of media management.</p>
<p><strong>What's New in evrExpanse 4.2.0:</strong>
🚀 Enhanced Transfer Engine: Our Offload function is now turbocharged, delivering significantly faster file transfers compared to previous versions. Experience a speed boost that will revolutionise the way you manage your media and files.
📊 Genuine Multicore Experience: Harness the full power of your Mac, whether it's Intel-based or Apple Silicon. The enhanced transfer engine intelligently utilises all available cores, ensuring optimal performance for a seamless workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of evrExpanse 4.2.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient Offload Process with Secure Data Transfer:</strong> The introduction of the Offloading Data Process ensures a streamlined and secure transfer of media files. The Offload function, empowered by the xxh64 hash function, guarantees comprehensive checksum verification, providing users with confidence in data integrity during transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Metadata Support:</strong> evrExpanse 4 boasts enhanced metadata workflow support for a wide range of cameras and file types, including MOV, MP4, MXF, and NEV. This compatibility ensures a seamless import of metadata into various NLEs, streamlining the post-production workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Transcoding and Metadata Integration:</strong> The Smart Transcoding mode analyses audio and video streams, deciding whether to apply transcoding or passthrough based on the codec type. This ensures optimal quality preservation, and metadata integration facilitates a smooth editing experience.</li>
<li><strong>Process Plus© - Streamlined Workflow for NLEs:</strong> Process Plus© integrates transcoding, offloading, and metadata export into a single, cohesive operation. This streamlined workflow not only enhances efficiency but also ensures seamless integration with popular Non-Linear Editing systems (NLEs) like Final Cut Pro®, DaVinci Resolve®, and Assimilate SCRATCH®.</li>
<li><strong>Seal Processed Folders with ASC MHL or MHL v1:</strong> Users can seal processed folders using either ASC MHL or the legacy MHL v1. This feature ensures the creation of Media Hash List (MHL) files, tracking the integrity of all media files and providing a reference for digital motion picture production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The demo version of evrExpanse 4.2.0 has no limitations on the Offload function, allowing users to experience its full power before making a purchase.</p>
<p>Existing evrExpanse 4 users can upgrade to the latest version free of charge.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>CommandPost v1.4.25</strong> is out now with the following bug fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Final Cut Pro 10.6.6, Apple merged the <strong>Masks</strong> and <strong>Keying</strong> Effects Categories into a single <strong>Masks and Keying</strong> Effects Category, which we never accounted for. CommandPost now correctly applies the <strong>Masks and Keying</strong> effects in Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 and later. However, if you already have a shortcut key or control surface button for any of these actions (such as <strong>Draw Mask</strong>), you may have to select the <strong>Scan Motion Templates</strong> button in the <strong>Final Cut Pro</strong> panel in CommandPost Preferences to re-scan all your effects, then reapply the action to your keyboard shortcut or button. Thanks for reporting Димитър Маратилов!</li>

<li>Lots of big under-the-hood improvements. Metaburner now can handle very complicated and long feature film timelines without dropping frames. Thanks for reporting Sam Pluemacher!</li>

<li>Added a checkbox to <strong>Save FCPXML Internally</strong> within the <strong>Controls</strong> section. This is off by default. You'll only ever really need to turn it on if you want to access the FCPXML data via the Lua Scripting Engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>🐞 <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Metaburner now correctly renders when in <strong>Half Resolution</strong> in Apple Motion and <strong>Better Performance</strong> in Final Cut Pro.</li>

<p><img src="/static/capacitor-v1-0-0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.</p>
<p>For example, if you're working on <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.7</strong>, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML <code>v1.11</code> to <code>v1.9</code>.</p>
<p>Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from <code>v1.8</code> to <code>v1.10</code>.</p>
<p>Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to &quot;clean&quot; FCPXMLs.</p>

<p>This is of relevance to Final Cut Pro users, because Michael Cioni is a long-time hardcore Final Cut Pro user, with a huge amount of knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>He's also the king of Apple's Keynote - and creates beautiful videos seamlessly mixing Keynote and Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>No doubt, Strada will be highly integrated with Final Cut Pro, as that's what Michael uses to edit all of Strada's video.</p>

<p><img src="/static/capacitor-released.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Capacitor</strong> allows you to easily convert between FCPXML versions.</p>
<p>For example, if you're working on <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.7</strong>, but you have an online artist on an older Autodesk Flame, you can convert from FCPXML <code>v1.11</code> to <code>v1.9</code>.</p>
<p>Or if you have an old FCPXML in your archives, you can upgrade from <code>v1.8</code> to <code>v1.10</code>.</p>
<p>If there are differences between FCPXML versions, Capacitor will offer a list of warnings that you can also export.</p>
<p>Because Capacitor ensures it outputs FCPXML following Apple's strict DTD rules, you can also use Capacitor to &quot;clean&quot; FCPXMLs - for example, it corrects <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/314">this bug</a> in Final Cut Pro's output.</p>
<p>It support both <code>.fcpxml</code> files and FCPXML Bundles (<code>.fcpxmld</code>).</p>
<p>Capacitor was coded and created by <a href="https://github.com/randomeizer">David Peterson</a>.</p>
<p>The Capacitor icon was designed by the amazing <a href="http://matthewskiles.com">Matthew Skiles</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[12th March 2024]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Intelligent Assistance</strong> (aka Philip Hodgetts and Dr Gregory Clarke) have released their latest app, <strong>Embiggen</strong> on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p>Until <strong>31st March</strong> it's <strong>USD$29.99</strong> (before it increases to <strong>USD$34.99</strong>).</p>
<p>The official App Store description explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embiggen automatically uprezes still images from Final Cut Pro Events or Projects and returns them back to your Event or Project.</p>
<p>The new higher resolution images will have the same scale, position and rotation animations as the originals and appear the same size in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Using AI to make higher resolution images, Embiggen creates in-between detail you can zoom right into.</p>
<p>Simply drag your Event or Project from Final Cut Pro to Embiggen's floating interface and click Go!</p>
<p>Original and Embiggened images will returned to Final Cut Pro in Auditions.</p>
<p>Works with Apple silicon Macs running Final Cut Pro 10.5 or later.</p>
<p>Supports a wide range of images including: TIFF, PNG, JPEG, flattened PSD, GIF, BMP.</p>
<p>It does not support layered PSD files.</p>
<p>For images with alpha channels the alpha channel is removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read the official support documentation <a href="https://www.intelligentassistance.com/embiggen-help/">here</a>.</p>
<p>They're already released <code>v1.0.2</code> which adds an additional AI model, to ensure an optimal choice in upscaled image, taking advantage of different optimisations in each model.</p>
<p>It's a standalone application, not a Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension, however it has a handy <strong>Keep on Top</strong> toggle, to keep it above the Final Cut Pro interface.</p>
<p><img src="/static/embiggen-01.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You could use CommandPost to trigger the opening of the application via a shortcut key or control surface panel.</p>
<p>After you drag a Event or Project to Embiggen, it will prompt you for confirmation:</p>
<p><img src="/static/embiggen-02.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>...and then ask you where you want to save the high resolution images:</p>
<p><img src="/static/embiggen-03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It will then process the images:</p>
<p><img src="/static/embiggen-04.png" alt=""></p>
<p>...and you will be prompted as to which library you want to import the generated FCPXML file into.</p>
<p>I would love to personally see a few of these steps removed - however it's tricky to do in a sandboxed App Store environment, because when drag an Project from the Browser, the FCPXML that gets dragged has no metadata about the Library it came from (time for another Final Cut Pro feature request!).</p>
<p>If you dragged in a Project, you'll get a new Event back with a new project, which contains a Audition for every image that was Embiggen'd - so you can easily compare the new version to the original.</p>
<p><img src="/static/embiggen-05.png" alt="Screenshot from Intelligent Assistance"></p>
<p>Under the hood it uses <strong>Core ML</strong> to do it's magic - so it's all on device.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a simple app that does one thing really well - it's certainly a very handy tool to have in your toolkit!</p>
<p>You can find the official website <a href="https://www.intelligentassistance.com/embiggen/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can purchase on the Mac App Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/embiggen/id6478552030">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Arctic Whiteness' <strong>Final Cut Library Manager</strong> now has a new home at <strong>Hedge</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="/static/arctic-banner.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>After a decade of hard work and lots of updates (amazingly, they were up to version <code>v3.98</code>!) Vincent Zorzi &amp; Timothy Arms have decided to step away from their epic creation, and hand over development to Hedge to keep the application alive for the Final Cut Pro community.</p>
<p>Hedge have renamed the application to <strong>Arctic</strong>, and it has an awesome new icon.</p>
<p>You can read more about this in great detail on the <a href="https://blog.hedge.video/a-new-home-for-final-cut-library-manager/">Hedge blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you already own Final Cut Library Manager, the application will continue to work indefinitely, but it will no longer be updated or supported.</p>
<p>Final Cut Library Manager customers will have already received a discounted upgrade for Arctic in their email inbox. Please <a href="https://docs.hedge.video/arctic/upgrades">contact Hedge</a> if you didn't get it.</p>
<p>Arctic and Final Cut Library Manager are completely seperate applications - each with their own unique licensing and updating systems - which means you can still run them side-by-side, or run Final Cut Pro Library Manager on your old machine, and Arctic on your new machine, etc.</p>
<p>You can learn more, and download a free 10-day trial on the <a href="https://hedge.video/arctic">Hedge website</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Iain Anderson</strong> has released a new set of Motion Templates for Final Cut Pro called <strong>Emojisplosion</strong> on FxFactory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emojisplosion is the easiest way to add hundreds of emoji-based particles to your videos. You can make them sit behind a title, enhance a background or make a magic wand sparkle.</p>
<p>Emojisplosion gives you all the flexibility you need, without the complexity of a full particle system. It's perfect for educational, social media and sports videos, and ready for portrait or landscape videos. Most of the particles here are packaged as titles, but emoji-based transitions are included too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently on sale for <strong>USD$39</strong> for a limited time (before increasing to USD$59). There is also a free trial.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Marker Toolbox v1.3.2</strong> is out now with <strong>Frame.io V4</strong> support!</p>
<p>For those Final Cut Pro users using the awesome <a href="https://frame.io/v4">Frame.io V4 beta</a>, you have most likely noticed that the Frame.io Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension currently doesn't work properly with the beta, and if you try and export a <code>FIOJSON</code> file from the website, it doesn't always work correctly when imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>For example, if you import a <code>FIOJSON</code> from the website and import it into Final Cut Pro via the Frame.io <code>v2.6.1</code> Mac App, sometimes Titles will be missing, and there's other inconsistencies between what you see within the Frame.io website, and what gets imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Emery Wells writes on <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/frame-io-version-4-beta-is-here/">ProVideo Coalition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a beta, some of the existing Frame.io features may not be initially available, but you can be certain that those features—along with NLE integrations and companion apps—are an element of our forward- looking roadmap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime however, Marker Toolbox fills that gap for Final Cut Pro users - as you can export a <code>FIOJSON</code> from the website and import it into Marker Toolbox.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple has announced <strong>Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8</strong> and <strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad 2</strong>!</p>
<p>There's also a new <strong>Final Cut Camera</strong> app coming to iPhone &amp; iPad.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can read the official press release <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/final-cut-pro-transforms-video-creation-with-live-multicam-on-ipad-and-new-ai-features-on-mac/">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can watch the Apple Event on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can read Iain Anderson's thoughts on ProVideo Coalition <a href="https://www.provideocoalition.com/final-cut-pro-10-8-for-mac-announced/">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can watch Matthew O'Brien's reaction on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpqQi6BBlYY">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can watch Richard Taylor's Final Cut TV &amp; Coffee Live Stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J7zdaqlcl0">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big ticket items for <strong>Mac</strong> are...</p>
<p>A new <strong>Enhance Light and Color</strong> effect for the Color Inspector, offering the ability to improve color, color balance, contrast, and brightness in one simple step, and is optimized for SDR, HDR, RAW, and Log-encoded media.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro has had a <strong>Balance Color</strong> tool for a long time, and did a pretty good job at balancing things - it doesn't give you any controls (aside from a White Balance picker), so it's really just a one-click solution where it either works or it doesn't.</p>
<p>It also never really worked well with Log-encoded media.</p>
<p>For me personally, I'm NOT a colourist, I don't enjoy colour grading, and I generally do everything in the Color Board - so this new tool will be HUGELY helpful, and something I've been wanting for many years.</p>
<p>I do a lot of fast-turnaround corporate/advertising edits where there's no time to send to a professional colourist - so this will be a very handy tool to have in the toolbox!</p>
<p>It'll be very interesting to compare to <a href="https://colourlab.ai">Colourlab AI 3</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/enhance-light-and-color.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Smooth Slo-Mo</strong> adds Machine Learning speed effects, which will be very interesting to try out, and see how it compares with <a href="https://www.topazlabs.com/topaz-video-ai">Topaz Video AI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/smooth-slow-mo.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can now <strong>Rename Effects in the Video &amp; Color Inspector</strong>! This has something that the Final Cut Pro community have wanted for years - so it's awesome that it's finally coming!</p>
<p>You can also now drag &amp; drop effects from the Inspector to clips on the timeline and the browser! Hopefully this means you'll also be able to drag them into <a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a> or save them using <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost's</a> Pasteboard Buffer!</p>
<p><img src="/static/rename-inspector.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Timeline Index</strong> also got some love and attention, with added columns for Metadata Fields such as Reel, Scene, Camera Angle, etc.</p>
<p>This could be incredibly handy when combined with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost's</a> Timeline Index CSV Export feature!</p>
<p><img src="/static/timeline-index.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It also looks like they've finally added a button to toggle the <strong>Scrolling Timeline</strong> on and off!</p>
<p><img src="/static/scrolling-timeline.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Personally, I think this is a really solid update, with some great professional features that I'll be using every day. I'm excited to give it a test run!</p>
<p>The big ticket items for <strong>iPad</strong> are...</p>
<p>Things are <strong>faster</strong> on M4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With M4 on the new iPad Pro, final rendering is up to 2x faster, and editors can take advantage of support for up to 4x more streams of ProRes RAW than with M1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Live Multicam</strong> on Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 allows users to direct and control up to four cameras, providing a director’s view of each live video feed in real time.</p>
<p><img src="/static/ipad-multicam.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro for iPad now officially supports <strong>External Storage</strong> - so you can save your Projects &amp; Media on external drives.</p>
<p>There's no information on whether or not you can go from Mac to iPad yet though, so <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a> may still be necessary.</p>
<p>There's lots <strong>more content</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 brings more options to customize projects. Users can dial in their edits with 12 new color-grading presets, choose from eight basic text titles, score with 20 new soundtracks, and add additional dynamic backgrounds to create effect overlays and title sequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/static/dynamic-glitch-backgrounds.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/grading-presets.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/soundtracks.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/text-titles.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Interestingly, despite 3rd Party Content being listed as &quot;coming soon&quot; when Final Cut Pro for iPad first launched, there was still no mention of 3rd Party Content coming in this release.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see if any &quot;quality of life&quot; improvements are made in this new version - such as the ability to copy and paste things between Projects.</p>
<p>We're excited to check it out, when it ships later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 will be available later this spring as a free update for existing users, and available on the App Store for $4.99 (U.S.) per month or $49 (U.S.) per year, with a one-month free trial for new users.</li>
<li>Final Cut Camera will be available for free later this spring as a standalone app.</li>
<li>Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 will be available as a free update for existing users and for $299.99 (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store. All new users can download a free 90-day trial of Final Cut Pro.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Pinch and a punch for the first day of the month!</em></p>
<p>There's a great new article to read over at <a href="https://thefilmstage.com">The Film Stage</a> titled <strong>Jia Zhangke’s Editor Matthieu Laclau on Shaping Decades of Footage and His Trio of Cannes 2024 Premieres</strong>.</p>
<p>You can read it <a href="https://thefilmstage.com/jia-zhangkes-editor-matthieu-laclau-on-shaping-decades-of-footage-and-his-trio-of-cannes-2024-premieres/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Not mentioned in the article is that Matthieu uses Final Cut Pro. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our studio is called CUTTING EDGE FILMS and we collaborate on most of our films. Technically, we setup a very sophisticated collaboration workflow using Hedge Postlab and Apple Final Cut Pro. I know that most feature film editor are cutting with Avid or Premiere, and I used both of them in the past, but we’re not going back... Thanks to FCP, we are really more efficient, faster and even better editors, because we spend more time on the creative part instead of the technical aspect of the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations Matthieu on all your success at Cannes 2024!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>LUT Robot</strong> is now available on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>It allows you to automatically apply Camera LUTs with matching filenames.</p>
<p><img src="/static/lut-robot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When working on big long-form projects, such as feature films and television shows, DITs on-set create unique Camera LUTs for each shot.</p>
<p>For example, the production might be shooting on an ARRI Alexa and when they hand over the rushes, they also hand over LUTs for each camera file.</p>
<p>LUT Robot automatically applies Camera LUTs with matching filenames, saving hours of work for Assistant Editors, who until now, had to manually set the Camera LUT for each clip.</p>
<p>You can select a specific sub-folder within your Camera LUTs folder to scan.</p>
<p>This is a simple niche app, that saves high-end professional assistant editors using Final Cut Pro hours of time.</p>
<p>The <strong>LUT Robot</strong> icon was designed by the amazing <a href="http://matthewskiles.com">Matthew Skiles</a>.</p>
<p>The FCPXML Processing Engine used under-the-hood was created by <a href="https://github.com/randomeizer/">David Peterson</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple's <strong>Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC)</strong> kicked off at Apple Park today.</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-apple-park.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is the biggest day in the calendar for Apple Developers, because Apple showcase the next versions of all their operating systems, and new frameworks and APIs that developers can take advantage of.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can watch the quick three minute <strong>18 things from WWDC24</strong> summary video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtIWE4CCX5M">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can watch a five minute summary video about <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWk">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can watch a five minute summary video about <strong>Apple Intelligence Privacy</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=546ufMY7488">here</a>.</li>

<li>You can watch the <strong>Platforms State of the Union</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJZ5YcMsgD4">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, the Keynote was insanely slick, with some stunning transitions and lots of fun and seamless visual effects.</p>
<p>The top line items from the event were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introducing Apple Intelligence, AI for the rest of us. And exciting updates coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and visionOS 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read all about the <strong>highlights</strong> over on the Apple Newsroom <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/wwdc24-highlights/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can read a detailed technical blog post about their new <strong>Private Cloud Compute</strong> <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Following Apple's new trend, both the Keynote &amp; Platforms State of the Union were also <strong>shot on iPhone and edited on Mac</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-shot-on-iphone.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-shot-on-iphone2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It's currently unknown if it was cut in Final Cut Pro, although we do know that their previous <strong>Scary Fast</strong> event was cut in Adobe Premiere.</p>
<p>However, we also know that all of the WWDC developer session videos last year were cut in Final Cut Pro, and we understand that this is still the case this year.</p>
<p>First up, a great new feature for <strong>Vision Pro</strong> owners is you'll be able to view your Mac screen in new <strong>Wide</strong> and <strong>Ultrawide</strong> windows - giving you more screen real-estate for cutting in Final Cut Pro:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Panoramic productivity with Mac Virtual Display</strong><br />
Using Mac Virtual Display is like having an expandable, ultrawide screen that wraps around you. It’s the equivalent of having two 4K displays sitting side by side — everything looks astoundingly sharp and incredibly detailed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-vision-pro2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-vision-pro.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They also <a href="https://www.apple.com/visionos/visionos-2-preview/">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now you can connect your Magic Mouse or third‑party Bluetooth mouse to navigate while using Apple Vision Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another very useful feature for Final Cut Pro editors is <strong>Continuity</strong> in <strong>macOS Sequoia</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use your iPhone from your Mac</strong><br />
With iPhone Mirroring, you can view what’s on your iPhone and control it too, without having to reach for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will make getting files from your iPhone to your Mac a lot easier, than dealing with AirDrop.</p>
<p>In terms of Final Cut Pro news, it was confirmed in the Keynote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spatial Videos can then be edited in Final Cut Pro for Mac, and shared and viewed in the new Vimeo app for VisionOS. This new professional workflow will be available this fall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-spatial.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple pre-announced that spatial video was coming back in <a href="/news/20231111/">November 2023</a> - so this wasn't exactly new news.</p>
<p>For those outside of the USA, fall begins on September 22nd and ends on December 21st - so we'll most likely see a preview of this at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit.</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-fcp.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Apple writes in their Vision Pro <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/newsroom/2024/06/visionos-2-brings-new-spatial-computing-experiences-to-apple-vision-pro/">Press Release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capturing spatial videos on Apple Vision Pro and iPhone 15 Pro allows users to bring special moments to life and relive them as though they are back in the moment. Later this year, Canon will offer a brand-new spatial lens for its popular EOS R7 digital camera to capture gorgeous spatial video, even in challenging lighting conditions. An update to Final Cut Pro will enable creators to edit spatial videos on their Mac and add immersive titles and effects to their projects, and with the Vimeo app designed for Vision Pro, users will be able to upload and share spatial videos for others to discover and enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More interestingly however is that Apple has teamed up with Blackmagic Design to tackle <strong>Immersive Video</strong> - with no mention or hint as to whether or not Immersive Video will come to Final Cut Pro later down the line.</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-blackmagic.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here's what Blackmagic <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/media/release/20240611-02">announced</a> after the Keynote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BLACKMAGIC DESIGN ANNOUNCES THE WORLD’S FIRST COMMERCIAL CAMERA SYSTEM AND EDITING SOFTWARE FOR APPLE IMMERSIVE VIDEO ON APPLE VISION PRO</strong></p>
<p>Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive and DaVinci Resolve support 8K stereoscopic 3D capture and editing, empowering filmmakers to create Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro</p>
<p>Cupertino, CA, USA, June 10th, 2024 - Blackmagic Design today announced an end to end workflow for producing cinematic Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro. Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive is the world’s first commercial camera system designed to capture Apple Immersive Video. Apple Immersive Video is a brand-new storytelling format that leverages 8K, 3D video with a 180-degree field of view, and Spatial Audio to transport viewers to the center of the action. Blackmagic Design also announced updates to DaVinci Resolve, the industry-leading post-production software, that will give professional filmmakers the ability to edit Apple Immersive Video for the first time. Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive and a new version of DaVinci Resolve that supports Apple Immersive Video for Apple Vision Pro will be released later this year.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce the first-ever commercial camera system and post-production software that supports Apple Immersive Video, giving professional filmmakers the tools to create remarkable stories with this powerful new format pioneered by Apple,” said Grant Petty, Blackmagic Design CEO. “Built on the new URSA Cine platform, URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom, stereoscopic 3D lens system with dual 8K image sensors that can capture 16 stops of dynamic range. With this innovative system, filmmakers can record remarkable moments like action-packed scenes, unique perspectives, stunning landscapes, intimate performances, and more, all with incredible fidelity, offering viewers an unparalleled sense of realism and immersion.”</p>
<p><strong>THE WORLD’S FIRST COMMERCIAL CAMERA SYSTEM FOR APPLE IMMERSIVE VIDEO:</strong><br />
Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive features a fixed, custom lens system pre-installed on the body, which is designed specifically for Apple Immersive Video. The sensor delivers 8160 x 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level synchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so cinematographers can shoot 90fps stereoscopic 3D immersive cinema content to a single file. The custom lens system is designed specifically for URSA Cine’s large format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data that’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive lens data — which is mapped, calibrated and stored per eye — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW file itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE WORLD’S FIRST EDITING SOFTWARE FOR APPLE IMMERSIVE VIDEO:</strong><br />
An updated version of DaVinci Resolve will introduce powerful new features to create a comprehensive workflow for immersive video on Apple Vision Pro. Blackmagic customers will be able to edit Apple Immersive Video shot on the URSA Cine Immersive camera. A new immersive video viewer will let editors pan, tilt and roll clips for viewing on 2D monitors or on Apple Vision Pro for an even more immersive editing experience. Transitions rendered by Apple Vision Pro will also be able to be bypassed using FCP XML metadata, giving editors clean master files. Export presets will enable quick output into a package which can be viewed directly on Apple Vision Pro.</p>
<p><strong>URSA CINE IMMERSIVE IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF ANY HIGH END PRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>The evenly weighted camera body is built with a robust magnesium alloy chassis and lightweight carbon fiber polycarbonate composite skin to help filmmakers move quickly on set. Customers also get 12G‑SDI out, 10G Ethernet, USB-C, XLR audio, and more. The fold out monitor has a large 5″ HDR touchscreen on one side and an external color status LCD on the other. The right side of the camera features a dedicated assist station with a second 5″ HDR touchscreen that allows crew to work around the camera without needing external monitors.</p>
<p>An 8-pin Lemo power connector at the back of the camera works with 24V and 12V power supplies, making it easy to use the camera with existing power supplies, batteries, and accessories. Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive comes with a massive 250W power supply and B mount battery plate, so customers can use a wide range of high voltage batteries from manufacturers such as IDX, Blueshape, Core SWX, BEBOB, and more. Customers will also receive a top handle, antennas for high speed Wi-Fi, baseplate, 24V power supply and high voltage B mount battery plate for quick set up.</p>
<p>Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive comes with 8TB of high performance network storage built in, which records directly to the included Blackmagic Media Module, and can be synced to Blackmagic Cloud and DaVinci Resolve media bins in real time. This means customers can capture over 2 hours of Blackmagic RAW in 8K stereoscopic 3D immersive, and editors can work on shots from remote locations worldwide as the shoot is happening.</p>
<p>The new Blackmagic RAW Immersive file format is designed to make it simple and easy to work with immersive video within the whole post production workflow, and includes support for Blackmagic global media sync. Blackmagic RAW files store camera metadata, lens data, white balance, digital slate information and custom LUTs to ensure consistency of image on set and through post production.</p>
<p>Blackmagic URSA Cine Immersive is the first commercial, digital film camera with ultra fast high capability Cloud Store technology built in. The high speed storage lets customers record at the highest resolutions and frame rates for hours and access their files directly over high speed 10G Ethernet. The camera also supports creating a small H.264 proxy file, in addition to the camera original media when recording. This means the small proxy file can be uploaded to Blackmagic Cloud in seconds, so media is available back at the studio in real time.</p>
<p>Blackmagic Media Dock accelerates post production workflow by making it faster and simpler to start editing and performing color correction. Customers can mount up to three Blackmagic Media Modules for high speed access to media from multiple URSA Cine Immersive cameras all at the same time. The four high speed 10G Ethernet ports allow up to four separate edit workstations to connect directly and is extremely fast, even when a lot of users are connected at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-blackmagic6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is super interesting for Final Cut Pro professionals, as it shows that Blackmagic is really full steam ahead with Blackmagic RAW, with their new Blackmagic RAW Immersive format.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in Apple's Keynote they did mention that Apple's Compressor will be part of the workflow, although Blackmagic's press release makes it sound like Compressor is not needed (i.e. &quot;Export and deliver native files for viewing on Apple Vision Pro&quot;).</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-compressor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Last year Apple announced a new framework called <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaextension">MediaExtension</a>, that provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support - such as Blackmagic RAW and Nikon NRAW.</p>
<p>This was supposed to come in macOS Sonoma, but they silently killed it - but it looks like it's coming back for <strong>macOS Sequoia</strong>.</p>
<p>This is super interestingly as it means that a third party can finally add codec support for third party codecs that will work system wide (if the host app allows third party codec support) - i.e. Final Cut Pro could potentially finally have native Blackmagic RAW support without the need for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once a user installs and runs the host app, embedded format reader extensions become available to any app on the user’s system that opts in to using them by calling <code>MTRegisterProfessionalVideoWorkflowFormatReaders</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaextension">MediaExtension</a> will require macOS Sequoia, and is labelled as &quot;beta&quot; - so it's unclear if this will actually come in the public release later this year or not.</p>
<p>Currently the documentation just says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building MediaExtension format readers using ExtensionKit requires an entitlement. Updates include information about the entitlement and a link to the entitlement request form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...so we'll have to see if Apple eventually adds the entitlement request form (as they never did last year).</p>
<p>Currently a lot of the documentation also still says <code>macOS 14.0+</code>, so it's unclear how much attention Apple's put towards this Framework - and it might just be intended for camera manufacturers to use (i.e. for Blackmagic to build their own BRAW support, as opposed to ANY third party developer).</p>
<p>In the <strong>Platforms State of the Union</strong> video, Final Cut Pro for iPad did get a little nod in the SwiftUI section:</p>
<p><img src="/static/wwdc-24-swiftui.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In terms of macOS news, macOS Sonoma has always had issues with various H.264 decoding, but it looks like there's some fixes coming to <strong>macOS Sequoia</strong>, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed: On Apple Silicon, AVC (H.264) content at level 5.2 or lower can be handled by the hardware decoder. Content that otherwise conforms to level 5.2 but is high frame rate (e.g. 4k at 100 or 120 fps) and labelled level 6, 6.1 or 6.2 is also handled by hardware. However, if width or height is greater than 4096 columns or rows and content uses 4:2:0 chroma subsampling and 8 bit depth, the hardware decoder driver will reject it and a software decoder will be automatically selected to ensure artifact-free decoding. Now, if content is 10 bit, 4:2:2 or 4:4:4, the hardware decoder will be used. (127003443)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For developers, there's a HEAP of exciting new technologies and frameworks - especially in terms of on-device machine learning, such as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/translation/translating-text-within-your-app">transcription</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully we eventually see some of these technologies and frameworks used on a future version of Final Cut Pro, but for now, we wait for <strong>Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8</strong> - Apple previously announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pricing and Availability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Final Cut Pro for iPad 2 will be available later this spring as a free update for existing users, and available on the App Store for $4.99 (U.S.) per month or $49 (U.S.) per year, with a one-month free trial for new users.</li>
<li>Final Cut Camera will be available for free later this spring as a standalone app.</li>
<li>Final Cut Pro for Mac 10.8 will be available as a free update for existing users and for $299.99 (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store. All new users can download a free 90-day trial of Final Cut Pro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's a good chance we'll see Final Cut Pro updated later this week or next.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Color Finale Transcoder v2.0</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>You can watch the announcement video here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYp_BpTERbo"><img src="/static/color-finale-transcoder-2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Existing Color Finale Transcoder v1.0 users can upgrade at a discounted rate (check your emails).</p>
<p>There's also a fully featured <strong>7-day free trial</strong>, so you can try before you buy.</p>
<p>This new version includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nikon N-RAW support</li>
<li>Edit BRAW and N-RAW clips on the timeline without transcoding</li>
<li>Create movies out of raw images from stills cameras</li>
<li>Use without Final Cut Pro as a standalone app</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about this update in more detail on their <a href="https://colorfinale.com/blog/post/cft2-announcement-05-24">blog</a>.</p>
<p>We've been testing out the initial v2.0.0 release, and there's a few things to keep in mind when using the new <strong>Use Original Media</strong> feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever you set as your <strong>Resolution</strong> in the Workflow Extension is what is used as your clip's resolution. For example, if your BRAW clip is <code>6144 x 3456</code>, if you have <strong>1/2 (3072x1728)</strong> selected in the Workflow Extension's Inspector prior to importing, the clip that's imported into the Final Cut Pro will be <code>3072 x 1728</code>. Whilst there is a <strong>Resolution</strong> dropdown in the <strong>BRAWReader</strong> effect on the clip, so you can adjust the decode quality - the source clip will always still be <code>3072 x 1728</code>, which could be a quality issue if you want to access the full image data or want to send a <code>FCPXML</code> to DaVinci Resolve. For now, I'd recommend importing everything at <strong>Full Resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>We've found that whilst clips generally play back perfectly in the timeline, on some clips in the Browser it won't play back the images correctly. For example, on a 45min clip, in the Browser the first 30mins is stuck on the first frame - however it plays perfectly in the timeline. This same issue happened when adding these same clips to a Synchronised Clip. This is hopefully just a simple bug that can be fixed in a future update.</li>
<li>Applying speed effects to clips directly doesn't work. For example, if you a 25fps BRAW clip in a 25fps timeline, if you apply a <strong>Fast 2x</strong> effect, you just get a freeze frame. However you can workaround this by creating a Compound Clip, or putting the clip into a Synchronised Clip or Multicam first.</li>
<li>There's currently no way to re-link BRAW/N-RAW files - if the file path has changed, it will just show missing media. As a workaround, you could export a <code>FCPXML</code> and do a find and replace of the file path.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/static/transcoder-missing-media.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>There was a few times during testing with speed effects that Final Cut Pro reported <strong>Cannot perform this operation. The application detected an error that prevents changes from being saved. To avoid losing your work, quit Final Cut Pro.</strong>. This is something we've never really come across, and we're not exactly sure what's triggering this, but will keep investigating.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/static/cannot-perform-this-operation.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>There was a few times when working with N-RAW that frames would fail to render, and we would get an error like the below. N-RAW seems to require a lot more CPU/GPU strength than BRAW.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/static/color-finale-transcoder-timeout.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>We tested moving projects from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve, and it works well, however you'll have to manually <strong>Replace Selected Clip...</strong> to force relink to the original BRAW file.</li>
<li>We tried working with several BRAW and N-RAW clips in a Multicam and it worked well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that Color Finale Transcoder can already transcode ARRIRAW and CinemaDNG, it'll be interesting to see if we'll be able to <strong>Use Original Media</strong> for these formats too in a future update.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rotomatic v1.0.0</strong> is out now on FxFactory.</p>
<p>It features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Automatic object detection and tracking</strong>
Rotomatic simplifies the tedious task of manual rotoscoping by automating it, offering significant control to achieve desired results with convenience and speed. Developed using a contemporary machine learning framework, Rotomatic employs multiple neural networks to enhance object detection and tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Intuitive on-screen configuration</strong>
Intuitive, on-screen configuration for efficient and practical rotoscoping application. Our &quot;Refine, not Redo&quot; philosophy means that labor-intensive steps like object definition and tracking are seldom repeated. The built-in timeline facilitates management of keyframes and selected objects, especially for extensive clips requiring rotoscoping.</p>
<p><strong>Incremental refinement</strong>
Keyframes, objects, and their elements can be adjusted and reprocessed without impacting previously computed outcomes. Rotomatic offers a more efficient and user-friendly way to achieve professional rotoscoping results.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's an exciting (and very busy) Friday here at FCP Cafe!</p>
<p><strong>Final Cut Pro v10.8</strong>, <strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad v2.0</strong>, <strong>Final Cut Camera v1.0</strong>, <strong>Motion v5.8</strong>, <strong>Compressor v4.8</strong> are all out now!</p>
<p><strong>iMovie v10.4.1</strong> is out with stability and performance improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Video Formats v2.3.1</strong> is out now.</p>
<p>For developers, <strong>FxPlug v4.3</strong> is also out now, along with <strong>FCPXML v1.12</strong>.</p>
<p>The new <strong>Color Adjustments</strong> feature in Final Cut Pro 10.8 is definitely our favourite new addition, although renaming Effects will be pretty handy too.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro v10.8 and Final Cut Pro for iPad v2.0 have a new library database version (now <code>1110</code> compared to <code>1090</code> in 10.7.1), so you'll need to update older libraries.</p>
<p><img src="/static/new-library-version.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em><strong>We strongly recommend making a backup of all Final Cut Pro Libraries before updating them!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Transfer Toolbox v1.2.0</strong> is also out today, allowing you to move Libraries from Final Cut Pro v10.8 to Final Cut Pro 2.0 (for iPad).</p>
<p>You can learn more and download for free <a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/transfer-toolbox-1-2-0.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Arctic v24.2.0</strong> is also out today with Final Cut Pro 10.8 support.</p>
<p>You can learn more <a href="https://hedge.video/arctic">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/arctic-24-2-0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sadly, unlike some Final Cut Pro YouTuber's and Trainers, we don't get early access to these Final Cut Pro updates, so we are currently carefully testing and reviewing all these changes, and how they affect our own apps and workflows.</p>
<p>We will post our test results over on our <a href="/update-guide/">Should I Update?</a> page as we learn new things.</p>
<p>So far we can confirm that <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> and <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a> both seem to be working great! If you spot any issues, please reach out.</p>
<p>We will aim to add <strong>Color Adjustments</strong> support to CommandPost in the coming weeks, so that you can control all the parameters with your preferred control surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://capacitor.pro">Capacitor</a> will also be updated soon to support FCPXML v1.12.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew O'Brien</strong> has already reported some weirdness in Final Cut Pro 10.8 on <a href="https://x.com/matthewtobrien/status/1803950906494587247?s=46&amp;t=rAqnb4ykI8KSBTwguvX5fg">Twitter</a>, however we haven't been able to reproduce.</p>
<p><img src="/static/matthew-obrien-fcp10-8-twitter-bug.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em><strong>As always, before updating, please make sure you make a backup of the Final Cut Pro application, and your existing Final Cut Pro Libraries.</strong></em></p>
<p>Final Cut Pro 10.8 removes support for DVD &amp; BluRay burning. However, you can always keep a copy of Final Cut Pro 10.7.1 handy or buy <strong>Toast 20 Pro</strong> at a discounted price for a limited time <a href="https://www.roxio.com/en/products/toast/pro/?promo=EUXG">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/static/news-import.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's a <strong>Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension</strong> that allows you to import <strong>NewsML-G2</strong> and <strong>VPMS</strong> metadata into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>This is useful if you're working with news outlets that use the NewsML-G2 standard or a VPMS system, and you need to reference this metadata for deliverables.</p>
<p>News Import works well alongside other 3rd party applications such as <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#producers-best-friend">Producers Best Friend</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Matthew O'Brien</strong> has been putting on his detective hat to look at some weird bugs in Final Cut Pro 10.8.</p>
<p>He writes in his first video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this video I'm breaking down TWO bugs I've heard about with Final Cut Pro 10.8. One bug has to do with audio skimming and playing back audio one frame at a time using the left and right arrow keys. Some users are reporting that you can no longer hear audio when using the arrow keys.</p>
<p>The second bug is one that I'm experiencing. Any time I try to interact with an element in the Viewer to transform it with scale or position or rotation, Final Cut Pro hangs. It doesn't quit, it doesn't crash, I don't get a spinning rainbow wheel... It just hangs. If I try to change my text with the title tool or use a mask effect it hangs. Any time I &quot;touch&quot; an element in the Viewer, Final Cut Pro hangs.</p>
<p>This is happening on my M1 Max Mac Studio, my M1 Pro 14&quot; MacBook Pro, but it IS NOT happening with my M2 Pro Mac mini.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV1h_ljWWOA"><img src="/static/youtube-matthew-fcp10-8-bugs.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>However, regarding the first bug he mentions in the video Richard Taylor writes on <a href="https://x.com/RichardTaylorTV/status/1805600092839157762">Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those experiencing the FCP 10.8 audio frame by frame, skimming bug, place your mouse, cursor over any window, but the timeline!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew followed up with another video, where he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my last video I broke down a major Final Cut Pro 10.8 bug where trying to adjust elements in the viewer window was causing Final Cut Pro to hang or freeze. Editing text with a title tool, using the Transform Tool to adjust scale or position - these adjustments were freezing Final Cut.</p>
<p>In this video I'm going over what seems to be causing this to happen while, unfortunately, not coming up with a root cause that allows us to resolve the issue. I think this is definitely going to need a software update to fix things since I've already tried every troubleshooting step that I can think of per Apple's support document linked <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105044">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJGnu0Gn3iA"><img src="/static/youtube-matthew-fcp10-8-bugs-solved.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After posting this video, he's then discovered a workaround/solution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So it seems the issue is specific to the newer Magic Trackpad and the trackpad on Mac notebooks.</p>
<p>If you disable <strong>Tap to click</strong> in <strong>Settings &gt; Trackpad</strong> you can interact with elements in the Viewer window without any issue.</p>
<p>If you disable <strong>Use trackpad for dragging</strong> in <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Pointer Control &gt; Trackpad Options</strong> you can drag elements in the Viewer window.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I'm guessing enabling the ability to drag and drop effects from the Inspector onto the Viewer window may have caused this bug?
Of course none of this affects FCP if you're using a Magic Mouse, Mighty Mouse or 3rd party mouse.</p>
<p>This also doesn't affect FCP if you're using the older AA battery-powered Magic Trackpad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully these are both fairly simple bugs that Apple can address in a point update within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>You can keep track of all of Final Cut Pro's bugs and issues on the FCP Cafe <a href="/bugtracker/">Bug Tracker</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mike Matzdorff</strong> is removing his incredible book titled <strong>Final Cut Pro X: Pro Workflow: Proven Techniques from the First Studio Film to Use FCP X</strong> from Apple Books and Amazon.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend you purchase it RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>Mike explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple reasons for taking it down...<br />
I think there are better resources available, which may have built on what I did (see Iain Anderson's <a href="/learn/training/#final-cut-pro-efficient-editing-book">Final Cut Pro Efficient Editing</a>) - there are still some good techniques in there, but the ideas are nearly ten years old.<br />
I think one of my hopes, at the time, was that FCP(X) would be something I could use in my main (paying) editing work, and due to the manufacturer's development choices, it wasn't something I could sell productions on.<br />
Which is ok. It's great software, supported by a great community and Apple folks. The book is a bargain, even now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can purchase from Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Cut-Pro-Workflow-Techniques-ebook/dp/B00UO2NA8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8">here</a> and Apple Books <a href="https://books.apple.com/au/book/final-cut-pro-x-pro-workflow/id980656984">here</a> for a short time only!</p>
<p>Thanks Mike for EVERYTHING you've done for the Final Cut Pro community! Legend.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Apple has released two new videos about Final Cut Pro for Mac and Final Cut Pro for iPad on their official YouTube Channel.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed, but I'm fairly confident these were the videos that Apple opened with when we visited Apple Park last year for the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit.</p>
<p>You can watch here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy3k9M8kqu0"><img src="/static/youtube-fcp-for-mac-apple.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IshJoOuIJQ"><img src="/static/youtube-fcp-for-ipad-apple.jpeg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Either way, it's great to see the wider Apple finally promoting Final Cut Pro to the world!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're a developer who works with Final Cut Pro <strong>Workflow Extensions</strong>, you may have noticed that things break when you upgrade to <strong>macOS Sequoia 15.0</strong> and <strong>Xcode 16.0</strong>. Doh!</p>
<p>Thankfully the fix is fairly simple once you know the trick...</p>
<p>If you're seeing this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/workflow-extension-error-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Simply change this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/workflow-extension-error-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/workflow-extension-error-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is because in Xcode 16.0, a clang fix was made that now requires a space after the entry linker option <code>-e</code> to disambiguate this option from other options that start with the letter <code>e</code>.</p>
<p>To fix the error, you simply need to separate out the <code>-e</code> from <code>_ProExtensionMain</code> in the <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong> build setting.</p>
<p>As of today, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/professional-video-applications/workflow-extensions?language=objc">Workflow Extensions SDK</a> hasn't been updated, but hopefully we'll see this fixed in the Xcode template soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to Phil in the <a href="http://cocoaheads.org/au/Melbourne/index.html">CocoaHeads</a> community for helping me work this out!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>MotionVFX</strong> is working on something new, and something really cool, most likely called <strong>mExtension</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/motionvfx-workflow-extension.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/motionvfx_workflow_extension_05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We can only ASSUME that it's a new Workflow Extension based off their videos...</p>
<p>It looks like it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addons</li>
<li>Backgrounds</li>
<li>Camera Movements</li>
<li>Compositing Elements</li>
<li>Effects</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Intros</li>
<li>Overlay Effects</li>
<li>Placeholders</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest, we're surprised it's taken them this long to build a Workflow Extension, as normally MotionVFX are first to market when it comes to Final Cut Pro tech.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TEnRzu-N02I">first hint</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new era of creativity is on the horizon... ✨</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H7_fXYfeXyI">second hint</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something big is coming... 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7Z2HLHqyT2E">third hint</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Final Cut Pro is about to get bigger! 💣</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LZdhdqYFc6A">latest hint</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open endless opportunities in Final Cut Pro ♾️ #videoediting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see some screenshots of the above videos here:</p>

<p>It's yet to be seen if this will be subscription or if it just has access to your existing MotionVFX purchases.</p>
<p>We're excited.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>November is RAPIDLY approaching, and if you haven't already considered going to the <strong>FCP Creative Summit</strong> you DEFINITELY should.</p>
<p>I'll be there!</p>
<p>You can read why Iain Anderson thinks you should come <a href="/fcp-creative-summit/#why-should-you-go">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can get <strong>15% off</strong> here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/965178022447/?discount=FCPCAFE"><img src="/static/fcpcs-2024-discount.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There's some great speakers in the mix, but probably most exciting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fitness+ How We Use Final Cut Pro</strong><br />
<strong>Speaker:</strong> Apple Fitness+ Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last year at the Summit Apple told us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One interesting point to note is that even though the Scary Fast event wasn't cut in Final Cut Pro (yes, it was cut in Premiere) - everything for Apple Fitness+ is - over 4,700 videos, 15 hours every week, all cut in Final Cut Pro using ProRes. Apple is eating their own dog food, at a major scale. Also, all the WWDC talks this year were cut in Final Cut Pro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also hinted that they were doing some special/funky metadata stuff for Fitness+ but didn't go into any deep details - so HOPEFULLY we learn more this year.</p>
<p>There will be LOTS of new tech discussed at the event.</p>
<p><strong>MotionVFX</strong> has just released a tonne of new products, which I'm sure everyone will be talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Wes Plate</strong> from <strong>Automatic Duck</strong> will be presenting - so we can all safely assume he'll announce something amazing (I wonder if you can guess what it is!).</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>Michael Cioni</strong> from <strong>Strada</strong> will be doing a keynote talk, <strong>Bet on the Future, bet on Yourself</strong>. Michael is one of the best public speakers in our industry, so his talks are always amazing.</p>
<p>I'm also currently helping <strong>Arthur Moore</strong> of <a href="https://arthurmoorefx.sellfy.store">BadAss FX</a> fame on a secret project, that will HOPEFULLY be out by the Summit too!</p>
<p>So come along - it'll be awesome.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[3rd October 2024]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday <strong>MotionVFX</strong> released <strong>DesignStudio</strong>, <strong>mExtension</strong> and <strong>mCaptions</strong>.</p>
<p>But before I rant, watch <strong>Jenn Jager</strong>'s amazing video on YouTube reviewing <strong>DesignStudio</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W819fjZYh_Q"><img src="/static/jenn-designstudio-review.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We're MASSIVE fans of MotionVFX. NOT including their subscriptions I've spent over <strong>AUD$7,596.53</strong> on MotionVFX products.</p>
<p>The MotionVFX team are next-level talented, and create absolutely beautiful products that no other company can compete with.</p>
<p>That said... for us at least, yesterday's launch really didn't go that well.</p>
<p>We couldn't even pay the very expensive <strong>USD$682.82</strong> cost because &quot;something went wrong&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="/static/motionvfx-launch-01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We tried multiple credit cards from multiple banks.</p>
<p>With MotionVFX being based in Poland, and LateNite being based in Melbourne, Australia, getting through to live chat support took a while.</p>
<p>Eventually they tweaked the error message, but alas, it still wasn't working for us:</p>
<p><img src="/static/motionvfx-launch-02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To be fair... we think this was most likely an issue on <a href="https://www.paddle.com">Paddle</a>'s end - the payment provider that MotionVFX uses, however, as someone who knows the backend of Paddle quite well, I found it pretty disappointing that MotionVFX support couldn't just manually upgrade my subscription - as I was already paying for CineStudio 2D + 3D, so they already had my credit card details.</p>
<p>MotionVFX's live chat support staff were super lovely and human, which is always nice. But there was no special treatment here - no offer of a discount, no offer to some how fast track things. I basically just had to keep trying until it worked.</p>
<p>This kinda sucks - as MotionVFX have such a <a href="https://www.motionvfx.com/about">big team</a> - I would expect better support, where they just do whatever it takes to get me up and running.</p>
<p>Eventually, after about the 100 time of trying to submit, I got a SMS from my bank about unusual activity on my credit card, which I accepted, and then, thankfully, I tried buying the <strong>Ultimate Plan</strong>, and it worked, woohoo! I have no idea why I didn't get this SMS on the first attempt, or the next 99 attempts, but it must have been a bug somewhere in the Paddle flow.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing <strong>mInstaller</strong>, we now have <strong>mExtensionInstaller</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mextension-installer.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I'm not really sure why they didn't just put this in <strong>mInstaller</strong> - it kinda makes no sense, but anyway...</p>
<p>First up I tried <strong>mExtension</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mextension.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's a Workflow Extension that contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addons</li>
<li>Backgrounds</li>
<li>Camera Movements</li>
<li>Compositing Elements</li>
<li>Effects</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Intros</li>
<li>Overlay Effects</li>
<li>Placeholders</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Transitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you find something you like you can simply drag it to your timeline, and like magic, it just works.</p>
<p>There's a HEAP of stuff - and as you'd expect with MotionVFX, the design work is AMAZING.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that this Workflow Extension just seems to be a fancy webview - so it's loading off the Internet, and it's SLOW - at least in Australia.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any local caching or persistence - it requires an active Internet connection and doesn't really alert you to if you're offline - it just kinda... stalls.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mextension-no-internet.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you download an item, it just gets added to your regular Motion Templates folder, so in future you can just access directly from Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mextension-downloaded.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a daily limit on how many things you can download:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mextension-limit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Overall, it seems like a really solid product, with lots of great templates - and having it directly in Final Cut Pro is amazing. I'm really surprised it took them this long to build a Workflow Extension to be honest!</p>
<p>Next up... we have <strong>mCaptions</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here's the official tutorial featuring the amazing <strong>George Edmondson</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DYbHcQD4bE"><img src="/static/mcaption-tutorial.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>!!!danger UPDATE (20241003 1250)
Opps! I was wrong about the below.<br />
The amazing George Edmondson explained to me that as he discusses in his tutorial video above you can actually export SRT files from mCaptions as well!
!!!</p>
<p>Confusingly... <strong>mCaptions</strong> doesn't create <strong>Captions</strong> - it creates <strong>Titles</strong>.</p>
<p>Ironically... whilst we're very confident that we'll see automatic captions support in Final Cut Pro 11 at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit, we're less confident about automatic titles.</p>
<p>My GUESS is that Apple and MotionVFX have probably already discussed this, and my GUESS it that mCaptions won't compete with Apple's native captions support.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, once we have native caption support in Final Cut Pro, we could use that metadata to generate our own titles, so that's only matter a time before a third party developer solves this once FCP11 is out in the wild - it could even potentially be a CommandPost Toolbox.</p>
<p>But for now... we have mCaptions.</p>
<p>Like <a href="/developer-case-studies/transcriber/">Ulti.Media Transcriber</a> and <a href="/ecosystem/tools/#builder-nle">Builder NLE</a> it's using OpenAI's Whisper under the hood.</p>
<p>In this case mCaptions is using <a href="https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/main/ggml-large-v3.bin">Whisper.cpp's Large V3 model</a>.</p>
<p>Our first test was with some <a href="https://strada.tech">Strada</a> test clips (that have been provided to Strada beta testers), in Mandarin, and it failed miserably.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions-fail.png" alt=""></p>
<p>!!!danger UPDATE (20241003 1630)
MotionVFX has since contacted me and have said:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the issue with analyzing Chinese - we're aware of it and an update should be ready within the next few days.
!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next we tried some other Strada test clips, but they had multiple audio channels, and mCaptions wouldn't even import them:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions-fail-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It would be great if mCaptions was smart enough to read the enabled channels from the FCPXML and only use the enabled channels for transcription. Maybe in a future update.</p>
<p>!!!danger UPDATE (20241003 1250)
Opps! I was wrong about the below.<br />
The amazing George Edmondson explained to me if QuickTime Player can read it - mCaptions can read it - they both use AV Foundations. You can also drag-and-drop from Finder, not just Final Cut Pro.
!!!</p>
<p>It also can't import SOME video files, which is a shame. There's no error message though, so it's hard to know what works and what does without just trying.</p>
<p>So basically, currently it seems mCaptions is basically limited to mono or stereo AIFFs or WAVs.</p>
<p>Next up we tried a <code>02:27:46:40</code> long audio clip (a podcast ripped from YouTube).</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions-long-clip.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sadly, it doesn't seem to push CPUs and GPUs as much as you'd hope (compared to WhisperKit in <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> for example):</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions-processing.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It writes verbose error logs in <code>/private/tmp/logError.txt</code> and <code>/private/tmp/log.txt</code> so you can see what it's kinda doing under-the-hood.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes I was only up to 11%, so I basically gave up transcoding this 2.5 hour clip. For reference, MacWhisper can do the same clip in under 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Next up we tried a 4 minute H264 - a pitch video that we did internally, which is mostly dialogue (all English) but with some subtle music underneath.</p>
<p>That seemed to work MUCH better, and was pretty fast to process:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mcaptions-success.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Overall though, I'm not sure that mCaptions is any better than <a href="/developer-case-studies/transcriber/">Ulti.Media Transcriber</a>, and definitely has far less options and control - although having it as a Workflow Extension in Final Cut Pro does save a lot of mouse clicks!</p>
<p>Having said that... it does have a very unique feature not found in other tools (so far)... <strong>word-by-word animation</strong> is amazing, and something I've already used on an actual job. When it works (i.e. clean English), it works amazingly well.</p>
<p>I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on MotionVFX's latest offerings!</p>
<p>Thanks team!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dylan Bates</strong> (The Final Cut Bro) has released an update to his <strong>Pro Zooms</strong> plugin.</p>
<p>He explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have added a zoom offset slider, which will now let you adjust the size of the zoom, without using the on screen controls. This is definitely a hacked together solution, but I was getting tired of waiting for an update from Apple to completely resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Just know, if you use the zoom offset slider, the on screen controls will no longer accurately show exactly what you will be zooming into.</p>
<p>If you were having no issues with Pro Zooms in the past, there is no need to update. This is only to help the few that can't seem to adjust the controls for whatever reason.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee">MKBHD</a> team (aka Marques Brownlee's YouTube team) gives a full masterclass on how they make high quality video.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant? They cut in Final Cut Pro - woohoo!</p>
<p>It's a really awesome video - and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/totallynotabusinessacc/">Mariah Zenk</a> gives some amazing insight into how and why she cuts things together. She's awesome.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is the lack of emoji's in the Library!</p>
<p><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube-03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>All the event names and underscores just make me feel like a technician - not an artist.</p>
<p>I'm personally a BIG fan of using emoji's - it makes Final Cut Pro more colourful and fun:</p>
<p><img src="/static/tiktok-awards.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can watch the editing section on YouTube here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dQ6yKSttEc&amp;t=1095s"><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Thanks for sharing <a href="https://x.com/JonnyLewisFilms/status/1845516567565508613">JonnyLewisFilms</a>!</p>
<p>I've just linked straight to the editing section above, but it's totally worth watching the whole thing - especially the audio section, which is super fun and interesting.</p>
<p>Although I am very surprised they're using Sennheiser MKH 416 Shotgun Microphones for their interior shoots, as opposed to a hyper-cardioid microphone, like a Schoeps CMC641, Sennheiser MKH 8050 or a Audio Technica AT4053B (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYWD5wI6B9k">this video</a> is worth a watch for anyone interesting in learning more!).</p>
<p>I'm also surprised how far away they're positioned the microphone - generally you want the microphone to be as close as possible to the talent, ideally no more than a foot away.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube-07.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here's some screenshots from the video:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube-05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/mkbhd-youtube-06.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I LOVE that the MKBHD is so open and happy to share all this amazing insight! Great work team!</p>

<p>It has the following changes:</p>
<p><strong>🔨 Improvements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Fujifilm X-M5 Blackmagic RAW clips.</li>
<li>Added support for Panasonic S5D Blackmagic RAW clips.</li>
<li>Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v4.2 to v4.3.</li>

<p><strong>🐞 Bug Fix:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when using macOS Sequoia where the hero BRAW Toolbox application would fail to set the correct folders when trying to grant sandbox permissions when first setting up BRAW Toolbox. For example, it would default to the user's &quot;Documents&quot; folders, rather than the user's &quot;Movies&quot; folder and the user's &quot;ProApps&quot; folder. Thanks for reporting Karl Winegardner, Robbie Myers, Jens Pluimes &amp; Edwin van W!</li>
<li>Re-designed how we render error messages in Final Cut Pro using Core Image and Metal. Hopefully this will fix random crashes some users are seeing on older versions of Final Cut Pro running on older Intel machines.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Colourlab Ai 3 Pro</strong> is out now!</p>
<p>This is a major update!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gen3.2 Color Matching Engine:</strong>
Colourlab AI 3.2 Pro introduces the first neural engine to work natively in ACES. It’s a multi-modal engine, supporting multiple types of image analysis for optimal color matching results. Trained on over 10 million custom-developed images, it automates color management without relying on metadata—purely analyzing the content of your image. The new auto-balance feature is just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Native Integration with DaVinci Resolve, Nuke, and Baselight:</strong>
Colourlab AI Pro now works natively inside these platforms. No more sending sequences in and out—just drag and drop the plugin onto your clip to access the full functionality previously available only through the desktop application.</p>
<p><strong>Floating License, Server-Based:</strong>
With this release, Colourlab AI Pro can now operate as a server-based application. One system in your facility can handle all the color matching, allowing all other systems to connect and use the same smart color metadata for perfect results.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Performance:</strong>
Colourlab AI Pro works in real time, supporting 4K and even 8K workflows, depending on the power of your system. The AI processing happens entirely on your device—no cloud, no extra costs—ensuring faster and more efficient work.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Color Management:</strong>
You’re no longer limited to ARRI Log C. Colourlab AI Pro works seamlessly in ACES, DaVinci Wide Gamut, and virtually any color space you prefer. The new Colourlab AI OFX plugin supports all imaginable color spaces, giving you maximum flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Reference Sharing:</strong>
Just like its desktop counterpart, Colourlab AI Pro allows you to share reference looks and images across projects effortlessly.</p>
