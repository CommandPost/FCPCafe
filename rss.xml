<p>FCPXMLs were sent to DaVinci Resolve for colour grading and X2Pro was used to send AAFs to ProTools for mixing. The sound designer was very impressed with the neatness of the timeline.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Chris at <a href="https://latenitefilms.com/technology/">LateNite</a> has updated the pricing for <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a> &amp; <a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">BRAW Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>79.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD79.99</strong>, <strong>USD79.99</strong>, <strong>CAD79.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://markertoolbox.io">Marker Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>19.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD19.99</strong>, <strong>USD19.99</strong>, <strong>CAD19.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://gyroflowtoolbox.io">Gyroflow Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their upcoming apps will have the same pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://recalltoolbox.io">Recall Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>29.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD29.99</strong>, <strong>USD29.99</strong>, <strong>CAD29.99</strong>).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://transfertoolbox.io">Transfer Toolbox</a></strong> is now <strong>4.99</strong> in your local currency (i.e. <strong>AUD4.99</strong>, <strong>USD4.99</strong>, <strong>CAD4.99</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, for example, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 4.99 (i.e. Rp89,000 in Indonesia), it will default to a USD$4.99 equivalent.</p>
<p>Transfer Toolbox is currently waiting for approval on the Mac App Store, but you can download from TestFlight.</p>
<p>Recall Toolbox is currently on TestFlight, and will hopefully be submitted to the Mac App Store by the end of this week for review.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>AudioSwift 2.3.5 Beta</strong> with 14-bit MIDI CC is <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/try-out-these-new-features-in-beta/">now available</a>.</p>
<p>AudioSwift for macOS transforms your trackpad into a set of MIDI tools like sliders, triggers, XY pads, mixing controllers and MPE. With support for MacBooks and Magic Trackpads, the app runs in the top menu bar waiting to be called. Tap the trackpad with a four fingers tap gesture to activate and a console window appears showing the current controller mode. You can then start sending MIDI with simple touch gestures and when you finish, press the Esc key to turn AudioSwift off. It’s the perfect compact MIDI controller for the mobile or desktop producer.</p>
<p>AudioSwift works great in companion with <a href="https://commandpost.io">CommandPost</a> via MIDI for <a href="https://audioswiftapp.com/fcp/">controlling Final Cut Pro</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Der Schatten</strong> (The Shadow) is streaming tomorrow on German public broadcaster <a href="https://www.zdf.de/serien/der-schatten/trailer-staffel-1-104.html">ZDFneo</a>.</p>
<p>It's a <strong>6 x 45min mystery</strong> series cut in Final Cut Pro, based on a novel by <strong>Melanie Raabe</strong>.</p>
<p><em>The journalist Norah (Deleila Piasko / Transatlantic) moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new life and job at a young &amp; arty magazine. As soon as she arrives, a homeless woman foretells her that she will kill a man named Arthur Grimm six weeks later. Norah tries to ignore the incident - until strange things happen.</em></p>

<p><strong>Commentary Head of Editing:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FlowDefoe">Florian Duffe</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editing a TV show in Final Cut is a charm if you set it up right. Especially with the new MacStudio and fast SSDs we could fly through the tons of footage. Postlab provides the necessary tools to collaborate between different workstations. Since we had a lot of Flashbacks, the structure of FCP - editing every Scene in a Compound Clip - made it really easy to 'steal' edits of another episode from our fellow editors.<br />
<br />
I will follow up with a decent case study on this site in a few days. Stay tuned.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a month old, but for those that might have missed it, there's an awesome YouTube video that showcases the Audio Design Desk v2.0 Beta.</p>
<p>Audio Design Desk is to audio software what Pro Tools was to the tape machine. It’s an entirely new breed of Digital Audio Workstation that artists can play like an instrument, revolutionizing the process of adding music and sound effects to picture and cutting down what can typically be a full day project to just a few minutes. It comes bundled with 75,000 sounds embedded with patent-pending Sonic Intelligence™, using AI-assisted content creation tools to enable filmmakers, sound designers, composers, and creators to produce cinema-quality compositions at the speed of thought, giving them a level of creative control that is unmatched by any other software.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At WWDC Apple has announced/released a new <strong>MediaExtension</strong> Framework, which is <strong>BIG NEWS</strong> for Mac users! We haven't had custom codec support since Apple killed QuickTime many years ago.</p>
<p>This framework provides a means for developers to create format readers and video decoders for media that the system doesn’t natively support.</p>
<p>This means that for <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, we'll be able to add native Blackmagic BRAW support directly to macOS!</p>
<p>We intend to add this as a feature to BRAW Toolbox for the public release of <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma-preview/">macOS Sonoma</a>, so stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>BRAW Toolbox</strong> v1.1.4 (51) is <a href="https://brawtoolbox.io">now available</a> on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug.</p>
<p>Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases.</p>
<p>As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> the default option as a workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a <strong>Custom</strong> Solids Generator.</p>
<p>Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results.</p>
<p>We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective.</p>
<p>To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a <strong>Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)</strong> Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip.</p>
<p>HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug.</p>
<p>We'll leave <strong>Create Multicam Clips</strong> on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Russ Hughes has written a great blog post titled: <strong>I Ignored Davinci Resolve - I Was Wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>It explains why he jumped from Final Cut Pro to DaVinci Resolve for editing, from a sound designers perspective.</p>
<p>You can read <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/production-expert-1/i-ignored-davinci-resolve-i-was-wrong">here</a>.</p>
<p>For context, for the stuff <a href="https://latenitefilms.com">LateNite</a> does Final Cut Pro is still king, for the simple fact that it’s the most fun and most creative tool to edit with.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve is INSANELY powerful, and Blackmagic is a much more friendly company to work with than Apple.</p>
<p>However, I personally feel like I'm an engineer when using Resolve, whereas in Final Cut Pro I feel like an artist.</p>
<p>You can do amazing things in both tools - but Final Cut Pro feels like the better instrument for creative flow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addresses an issue where audio effects would not be reset during playback.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an Audio Units effect could have incorrect values when importing using FCPXML.</li>
<li>Improves waveform redrawing on expanded audio components when adjusting volume with the Touch Bar.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where the Voice Isolation Amount slider would snap to 0% when trying to set a value less than 7%.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with the Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Control Range setting in the Color Adjustments effect would be incorrectly set to SDR when importing using FCPXML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, this update requires a database update, so there must be some bigger changes under the hood.</p>
<p><img src="/static/database-update.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Final Cut Pro for iPad 1.1</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes and enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn snapping on or off using the keyboard shortcut N.</li>
<li>Move the playhead backward or forward 10 frames using the keyboard shortcuts Shift-Left Arrow and Shift-Right Arrow.</li>
<li>Show info for browser clips using the keyboard shortcut Control-I.</li>
<li>Turn skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut S.</li>
<li>Turn audio skimming on or off using the keyboard shortcut Shift-S.</li>
<li>Split and switch multicam clip angles using the keyboard shortcuts 1, 2, 3, and 4.</li>
<li>Show or hide the jog wheel using the keyboard shortcut Control-Shift-W; expand or collapse it using Control-W.</li>
<li>Switch the jog wheel between playhead mode and nudge mode using the keyboard shortcut Shift-W.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with custom fonts not appearing in the inspector.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when dragging a clip from the browser to the timeline.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue with keyboard shortcuts not working as expected in the content browser.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback when adding effects and transitions to timeline clips in Position mode.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where importing media on a device with no remaining storage would cause Final Cut Pro for iPad to quit unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when retiming a clip with Scene Removal Mask applied.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where importing clips with the same name would generate blank clip thumbnails.</li>
<li>Improves reliability and performance when using soundtracks and dynamic titles.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where copying and pasting transform settings would unexpectedly paste clip speed.</li>
<li>Improves visual feedback and reliability when rating and adding keywords to clips while filtering clips in the browser.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where resetting audio settings would unexpectedly reset clip speed.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue with the appearance of onscreen controls for cropping and shape masks.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where clip height adjustments would not update audio-only clips in connected storylines.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where the Keywords window would open offscreen with the timeline minimized.</li>
<li>Resolves an issue where disabled multicam audio angles would appear in the audio component list in the inspector.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, Final Cut Pro 10.6.7 on Mac uses a newer Library format than Final Cut Pro 1.1 on iPad. This means that if you want to use Transfer Toolbox to go from Mac to iPad, you should keep using Final Cut Pro 10.6.6.</p>
<p><strong>Compressor 4.6.5</strong> is out now with the following enhancements and bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the Settings and Locations sidebar to now be resizable when the Inspector is open.</li>
<li>Improves reliability when processing 4:2:2-based H.264 media on Mac computers with Apple silicon.</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where the color space of a Photo-JPEG source was incorrect when Color space was set to Automatic.</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where an exported IMF supplemental package was one frame shorter than the original package.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motion 5.6.5</strong> is out now with the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves stability with FxPlug 4 plug-ins.</li>
<li>Improves stability when dragging a group that contains an FxPlug plug-in to the Favorites folder.</li>
<li>Improves performance when using the Sequence Text behavior with Anchor Point set to Line (in the Layout pane of the Text Inspector).</li>
</ul>
<p>We're excited to test it out, and see if there's other undocumented fixes and improvements.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>From the team behind Audio Design Design, <strong>SoundGen</strong> is a generative AI experience that turns your text prompts into music and art, with the option to download the files and add them into your film and audio projects.</p>
<p>The beta program is entirely free for you to use and experiment with. As SoundGen matures, the developers will be integrating it directly into <strong>Audio Design Desk</strong>.</p>
<p>Their goal is to give their users access to an even broader collection of sounds on demand, right within the DAW.</p>
<p>The alpha version can only do a maximum of 30 seconds. Depending on the prompt, sometimes it can found great, other times it's very computer generated. It'll definitely improve dramatically over time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.8</strong> is now available on the Mac App Store!</p>
<p>The release notes only have one line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixes an issue where video could freeze in the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, based on early reports, this release seems to fix the various crashes that users were reporting too, in addition to the Viewer sometimes going black or strobing.</p>
<p>If you're currently using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or earlier</strong> we recommend sticking with that for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if you're using <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> we recommend updating.</p>
<p>Please make sure you make a backup of your Final Cut Pro application by creating a <code>ZIP</code> file of it, before updating. You should also manually backup any libraries before updating.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the issues in <strong>Final Cut Pro 10.6.7</strong> <a href="https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/issues/223">here</a>.</p>
