If you liked this coverage, please let Apple and FMC know, so they might help me come back in future years!","I really loved this session, and I can't wait to catch up on all 305 episodes of their show!","I talked about my production company, LateNite, my software, Jumper and all kinds of other tangents.","I've been using Automatic Duck products (a company Wes and his father Harry runs) for decades - they've solved so many workflow problems across to many applications.","I've been very fortunate to be a very early beta tester of Multicam Flattener, and it does exactly what it says on the label - it works great.","I've previously produced a short film (for ABC TV) called The Legend of Burnout Barry with our director and two lead actors in wheelchairs, so I found this session extremely interesting and useful.","If you have an existing app on the Mac App Store that is not sandboxed, you may still submit bug fix updates after June 1.","If you haven't yet checked out Amove, Freque or Jumper- you absolutely should.","If you're not already following Tyler on YouTube, you absolutely should be.","It seems to me that Apple is slowly modernising the code for the iPad, and then bringing across these shared Frameworks to the Mac.","It was a great session, and they talked about Ashley's work on Best Foot Forward on Apple+ - you can watch a trailer below:","It's an effect that can move in 3D space, rotate in 3 dimensions and scale a clip with on-screen controls.","Multicam Flattener will be released soon after some further/wider beta testing, so join the Automatic Duck mailing list to stay updated.","My session was a Q&A session hosted by the incredible Nick Harauz from Boris FX.","Next up we had the amazing Tyler Stalman do a session discussing Shot on iPhone, Edited in Final Cut Pro.","Next up, I headed into the Cinema Therapy Case Study session.","Next up, in typical Sam Mestman style, we had an absolutely epic presentation.","Next up, it was lunch time - and again, lunch was super yummy!","Now, I've know Bradley Olsen & Alan Seawright for years - they once \"kidnapped\" me in their car in Las Vegas, many moons ago.","One of the questions I've been asked a lot over the last few days is... \"is Final Cut Pro 11 actually a big release\"?","Onwards & Upwards!","Our company, LateNite, bought a Lumaforge Jellyfish when Alan was still working at Lumaforge.","Over all though, the general mode and vibe was a happy one. Apple is listening. The team behind the tools we love are human. Apparently one of the crew that helped setup the demo room at Apple Park is an insanely good music video creator. The Final Cut Pro team literally \"share a wall\" with the Logic Pro team.","Previously Sam founded FCPWORKS and Lumaforge(who were acquired by OWC), runs We Make Movies and also works for Hedge on PostLab.","Sam demonstrated Amove's functionality, Justin La Vallee demonstrated Freque, Jeff Greenberg demonstrated Jumper.","Sandboxing on a Mac is a security mechanism designed to restrict what software can access and do on the system.","So, even though TECHNICALLY Final Cut Pro is now sandboxed, it can still read and write any files on your drive, so nothing really changes.","Thank you so much for allowing the Fitness+ team to come and showcase everything - it was seriously awesome to hear all the technical details of what they're doing - it was mind blowing of the scale and frequency that they're making things. One of the most interesting and curious things I noticed is that, despite the fact you showed us all their insanely cool camera robots, one of the key features the Fitness+ team highlighted in their presentation was the fact that they use Final Cut Pro's stabalisation. But they also told us that they do everything as a Multicam? So if they're constantly using stabalisation in Multicam clips, and they told us they're running the stock-standard version of Final Cut Pro, this means they're constantly going inside the Multicam clip, making cuts and stabalising inside the Multicam. If I was making that much content every day, it would drive me crazy! Given this, how much collaboration is there between the Fitness+ team and the FCP team.","Thanks to EVERYONE who reached out to me over the last week, chatted in the hallways, bought me a coffee or a beer and sent me DMs and messages!","The first session today was called Making Media Accessible for All, featuring Accessibility Lead at Apple Studios Tatiana Lee and director Ashley Eakin.","The slide show was incredible slick and professional, and the content was so great - it was probably one of my favourite session at the Summit.","Then finally, the big session of the day... Dialogue with Apple: Q&A.","Then he dropped a bombshell...","There was a great energy in the room, and lots of excitement. It was fun, it was open, there were laughs. Nothing was under NDA.","There was a lot of questions that were pre-submitted that the Apple team tried to best to answer, and there were also questions from the audience.","There was also a demonstration of how this all ties together in a real world production environment.","This approach minimises the risk of malware, data leaks, and other security breaches by isolating applications and tightly controlling their permissions.","This was an incredible session, also featuring editor Trevor Horton and producer Corinne Demyanovich.","Tight.

Resolve’s got face recognition. Final Cut Pro’s had the ability to \"analyse video\" for a decade - with options to automatically balance colour and find people. Ulti.Media has Transcriber and FCP Video Tag. Kino AI got people very excited for a few months (and I offered many times to help them get Kino AI working with Final Cut Pro!), until they decided to concentrate on Enterprise customers rather than freelance video editors. Strada is working on some incredible stuff - but it’s all cloud based - which is not an option for a lot of people due to privacy, but also slow internet (like we do in parts of Australia). There’s all this tech around, with so many options and possibilities - but there’s still no easy way to just search for \"guy wearing green t-shirt\" locally on your Mac... well, until now.","But at it's heart, Jumper really is a tool by video editors, for video editors. Arthur, myself and a giant team of amazing early beta testers have pushed hard to make the tool the most useful it can be in real-world scenarios for video editors. We’ve battle tested it on real jobs, with real deadlines and real pressure - sometimes it failed miserably, so we went back to the drawing board, iterated and improved.","But before I get into that, let’s jump back to 1st February 2023.","Finally in January 2021, a massive CommandPost v1.1.0 update was released to the world with Loupedeck (original), Loupedeck CT, Loupedeck Live, TourBox, Stream Deck XL and Stream Deck Mini support. It was such a popular release that Loupedeck actually reached out to me to start building an official Loupedeck plugin for CommandPost (i.e. within their official Loupedeck app).","For the next few years, I didn’t really hear much from Arthur - but as a video editor, I continued to use BadAss FX on hundreds of projects. Then in March 2024, he reached out again:","Going back to March 2024, my original advice was to do everything with FCPXML, however for various reasons, the first betas of Jumper for Final Cut Pro were reading the Library files at the file system level - which worked great... until you have to support Multicam & Synchronised Clips. Jump forward to today, and Jumper now have exceptional support for Multicam & Synchronised Clips thanks to the feedback of beta testers and the Jumper community. It really has been a team effort by some incredible supporters, including some amazing business mentors and advisors in Sweden, and Australia.","Hey Chris! I'm developing something really cool with my friend. It's a local running AI that helps users search for footage. We got pretty far with Premiere and we are starting to move to Final Cut soon. I wonder if you would be interested in looking at what we have done and maybe joining us?","I first discovered Arthur Moore back in June 2019 when he posted an incredible video about using the Loupedeck+ with CommandPost in Final Cut Pro:","I was already juggling all my own apps on the Mac App Store, Arctic for Hedge, this website, two kids and a film and television production company, so I didn’t really want to take on yet another crazy project - however, I agreed to help offer advice, we set up a Slack for Jumper... and before long, I got fully roped in.","I was on that podcast, and what Iain asked for isn’t something new or groundbreaking - every video editor I know wants to be able to just search for \"guy wearing green t-shirt\" in their NLE and it gets found.","I'm really excited by what's happening with the AI stuff, with stuff like Whisper... But the problem with captions in Final Cut is they only go on a project... I want them on clips as well, to make them searchable to a time so that you could search for a phrase you know somebody said and instantly find it in your rushes. You could do that today, I'm sure with Lumberjack... but I think there's room for Apple to add a whole lot more AI smarts... So the auto-tagging, you know, Apple should do that. Apple should be able to find where there's water in a shot, where there's a cat in a shot, where the shot is mostly red. It should be able to detect all of that and just do it for you on the fly.","I’m very biased, but it’s amazing. I basically describe it as Spotlight for your NLE.","I’m very glad Arthur took me along for the ride!","Introducing Jumper by Witchcraft Software in Sweden. \uD83C\uDDF8\uD83C\uDDEA","Jump forward to December 2019, and Arthur sent me an audio message asking for help building an installer for his BadAss Fx apps.","Jump forward to November 2024- and after 4 months or so of some crazy hours in-between other jobs and commitments, as well as lots of long and sometimes loud discussions, we have something that’s pretty incredible.","Jumper is the brainchild of YouTube and BadAss FX creator Arthur Moore.","Let me explain...","Native Blackmagic RAW support in Final Cut Pro. Download BRAW Toolbox today from the Mac App Store.","No clouds. No uploads. All on device.","Now, firstly, this isn’t a LateNite project - this isn’t my (Chris Hocking’s) baby.","On Richard Taylor’s FCPRadio Episode 134 podcast, Iain Anderson explained:","Onwards & Upwards!","Over the years I’ve reached out to countless companies and developers to try and convince them to build something exactly like this - but never really got any bites. Machine Learning and AI is really hard- and I was already personally juggling so many things, I didn’t want to start learning machine learning myself, so I never even attempted to add any ML or AI features to CommandPost or standalone apps - I left that for people like the amazing Alex Raccuglia.","Please watch this launch video on YouTube:","The thing I love most about Jumper really is that it’s just like Spotlight for your NLE. I was editing a fast turnaround corporate job earlier in the year, and I had a client over my shoulder saying things like \"find the footage of the guy with a purple shirt and a funny hat\" - Jumper could just find that shot instantly, and the client was pretty blown away. You don't even have to get the spelling correct.","The timing couldn’t have been worse - at the start of this year I was totally burnt out, exhausted and overwhelmed. I declined the offer, but said I’m happy to offer help and advice as needed, as I do for lots of people and companies in the Final Cut Pro space (hence this website).","Then a few months later in September 2019, Arthur did another video about CommandPost:","There’s basically four core team members in Team Sweden, and then I’m helping out from Melbourne, Australia - so timezones have been fun. Arthur and I are the crazy Final Cut Pro editors, and then Max and two of his best mates are the coding geniuses behind the scenes - who don’t actually have any background in film & television, or post production. It’s been super interesting and collaborative, getting feedback from people who have never even opened Final Cut Pro before, and don’t have decades of background (and baggage) when talking about fun things like Drop Frame Timecode, FCPXML DTDs, etc.","This was a pretty massive job, as the Loupedeck CT hardware is insanely powerful - with knobs, touch screen buttons, physical buttons, LED buttons, vibration, an internal hard drive, etc. By February 2020 though we had a pretty reliable beta, thanks to Arthur’s feedback and testing.","This wasn’t sponsored, he never contacted me in advance, and I had no idea he was doing it until I saw it shared online. I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the video, and how exciting it was. I was so humbled and amazed that someone was willing to do such an incredible video showcasing my silly little free and open source application - especially as I consider myself a filmmaker, not a programmer or developer.","Whilst I have no ownership in Witchcraft (the newly formed company behind Jumper), and it’s not my baby - I’m super proud of Jumper, and all the work that myself and Team Sweden has put into it. It’s entirely possible that Apple, Blackmagic or Adobe will Sherlock it at some point in the future - but for now, it’s the only tool on the market that can do what it does... all locally, all on device.","Whilst there’ll be some video editors that use Jumper all the time (i.e. documentary, nature, sports, etc), for others in the scripted world (i.e. scripted film & television), it may be less frequently used, because assistant editors will have already logged and organised the footage by scene, for example. However, just being able to open the Jumper Workflow Extension and instantly find ANYTHING in your Library is pretty insane. It’s a very handy tool to have in your toolbox - and I say this as someone who has built a lot of toolboxes over the years!","Whilst this site, and my interests, mainly lie in the Final Cut Pro universe - Jumper is not just for Final Cut Pro editors - it originally all started in Adobe Premiere, and Witchcraft plan to release for DaVinci Resolve and Avid Media Composer soon. They are also working on Jumper Enterprise, which allows you to analyse all your footage on a local server, and then have unlimited clients all access that data over your existing shared storage and network - it’s super exciting.","Whilst this was something I was super interested in helping with (and eventually years later, I ended up helping BretFX bring their apps to the Mac App Store), alas, this never happened, as I went down the giant rabbit hole of adding Loupedeck CT support to CommandPost, with Arthur beta testing it.","You can also watch a detailed tutorial video here.","You can buy and learn more here.","You should stop reading this and go download it now from here."]},{"l":"2nd November 2024","p":["Well, I didn't have this on my 2024 Bingo Card!","The Pixelmator Team plans to join Apple.","They write on their blog:","We’ve been inspired by Apple since day one, crafting our products with the same razor-sharp focus on design, ease of use, and performance.

The sensor delivers 8160 x 7200 resolution per eye with pixel level synchronization and an incredible 16 stops of dynamic range, so cinematographers can shoot 90fps stereoscopic 3D immersive cinema content to a single file. The custom lens system is designed specifically for URSA Cine’s large format image sensor with extremely accurate positional data that’s read and stored at time of manufacturing. This immersive lens data — which is mapped, calibrated and stored per eye — then travels through post production in the Blackmagic RAW file itself.","THE WORLD’S FIRST EDITING SOFTWARE FOR APPLE IMMERSIVE VIDEO: An updated version of DaVinci Resolve will introduce powerful new features to create a comprehensive workflow for immersive video on Apple Vision Pro. Blackmagic customers will be able to edit Apple Immersive Video shot on the URSA Cine Immersive camera. A new immersive video viewer will let editors pan, tilt and roll clips for viewing on 2D monitors or on Apple Vision Pro for an even more immersive editing experience. Transitions rendered by Apple Vision Pro will also be able to be bypassed using FCP XML metadata, giving editors clean master files. Export presets will enable quick output into a package which can be viewed directly on Apple Vision Pro.","They also announced:","This is super interesting for Final Cut Pro professionals, as it shows that Blackmagic is really full steam ahead with Blackmagic RAW, with their new Blackmagic RAW Immersive format.","This is super interestingly as it means that a third party can finally add codec support for third party codecs that will work system wide (if the host app allows third party codec support) - i.e. Final Cut Pro could potentially finally have native Blackmagic RAW support without the need for BRAW Toolbox!","This is the biggest day in the calendar for Apple Developers, because Apple showcase the next versions of all their operating systems, and new frameworks and APIs that developers can take advantage of.","This was supposed to come in macOS Sonoma, but they silently killed it - but it looks like it's coming back for macOS Sequoia.","This will make getting files from your iPhone to your Mac a lot easier, than dealing with AirDrop.","URSA CINE IMMERSIVE IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF ANY HIGH END PRODUCTION:","Use your iPhone from your Mac With iPhone Mirroring, you can view what’s on your iPhone and control it too, without having to reach for it.","You can read a detailed technical blog post about their new Private Cloud Compute here.","You can read all about the highlights over on the Apple Newsroom here.","You can watch a five minute summary video about Apple Intelligence here.","You can watch a five minute summary video about Apple Intelligence Privacy here.","You can watch the full Keynote here.","You can watch the Platforms State of the Union here.","You can watch the quick three minute 18 things from WWDC24 summary video here."]},{"l":"7th June 2024","p":["PostLab 2.0 Early Access is out now for all PostLab Classic teams!","Meet the future: collaborate on any creative app, no more subscription, and bring your own storage - whether it's a NAS or a cloud drive!","The successor to PostLab Classic is finally here, after Hedge's massive announcement at the Final Cut Pro Creative Summit last year (you can read my reaction from the Summit here).","You can read all about this groundbreaking software here.","LUT Robot is now available on the Mac App Store.","It allows you to automatically apply Camera LUTs with matching filenames.","When working on big long-form projects, such as feature films and television shows, DITs on-set create unique Camera LUTs for each shot.","For example, the production might be shooting on an ARRI Alexa and when they hand over the rushes, they also hand over LUTs for each camera file.","LUT Robot automatically applies Camera LUTs with matching filenames, saving hours of work for Assistant Editors, who until now, had to manually set the Camera LUT for each clip.","You can select a specific sub-folder within your Camera LUTs folder to scan.","This is a simple niche app, that saves high-end professional assistant editors using Final Cut Pro hours of time.","The LUT Robot icon was designed by the amazing Matthew Skiles.","The FCPXML Processing Engine used under-the-hood was created by David Peterson.","You can learn more here.","Gyroscope Stabilisation in Final Cut Pro.

We were transcoding the R3D files to Apple ProRes 422 HQ files at 1920×1080. We were using the full debayer quality, and REDSpace for both the Colour & Gamma spaces. This took a HUGE amount of time (almost two weeks of none stop processing), but at the end of the day we ended up with some terrific QuickTime files that we could throw into Final Cut Pro and start editing, plus we could also send these clips to the visual effects kids so that they could start playing. We did run into one slight problem after we THOUGHT that everything was done. On inspection of the transcoded files, we realised that all the QuickTimes for Day Two of shooting were EXACTLY the same as Day Four. I’m still not sure whether that was human error or REDrushes being annoying – but either way we had to re-transcode all of the day four footage. Unfortunately at this stage we had to give back the MacPro, so we had to do all of this on a stock standard first generation MacBook. It wasn’t quite as fast as the MacPro, but it got the job done. Eventually.","Although in the end we didn’t end up using any of the sync audio – we recorded audio separately to a Sound Devices 744T, which was synced to a Smart Slate. Originally we had planned to sync the camera to the 744T as well, but for some reason we couldn’t get it to work on the first day of shooting, so we gave up. I believe the problem has since been fixed with one of the RED ONE Firmware Updates. We only had one microphone on set – a Sennheiser 416 on a boom. We basically just recorded sound to use as a guide track for when it came to adding sound effects later on.","Although the plan was always to shoot to card for safety reasons (we’ve all got disaster stories to tell about Firestore’s dying and hard drives being dropped!) – we decided to gamble and record straight to the RED-DRIVE (a special drive designed for the camera which can store 320GB in a RAID 0 configuration). Not only that – but we decided to leave the dumping to the end of the day. This was a HUGE risk, because if the drive died at the end of the day, we’d potentially loose a whole days worth of shooting. However, we didn’t have the crew available to have a dedicated “data technician”, nor did we have the hardware to dump the cards on a regular basis. This may seem really silly (I mean seriously – all you need is a Mac laptop and a card reader!), but we had neither of those things at the time, and it was just easier to use what we had available. Luckily – nothing went wrong, and the RED-DRIVE was faultless – it never dropped a single frame! However, to anyone else planning to shoot on RED – I strongly recommend you do the complete opposite to what we did! Record to CF card and dump as soon as the card is full.","And that is the workflow we decided to use for Sakooz! At the moment we are just archiving all the project files to DVD, and keeping all the media on the SATAII drives. At some stage we will eventually put everything to LTO drives as a final backup – but we don’t have the money at the moment.","Arctic Whiteness has confirmed that Final Cut Pro Library Manager v3.98 works \"awfully well\" with Final Cut Pro 10.7.1.","At the end of each shooting day we dumped the RED-DRIVE and the 744T to two separate 1TB SATAII drives. For the duration of the shoot we managed to borrow a brand new MacPro Tower from Julian at Eidolon Creative and used this machine to do all the dumping as well as the transcoding. We put the two 1TB drives directly into the MacPro. We ended up with 508.34GB of camera footage, and a couple of GB of audio. We ended up purchasing two additional 500GB SATAII drives to make another backup of all of the R3D files – which we then stored at two separate locations away from our master edit suite, just in case. We called the drives Pinky (Master Edit), Bluey (Backup of Master Edit), Tumbles (R3D Master) and Splash (backup of R3D Master), because that’s what the names of the Sakooz creatures are called. Anyway… Now normally, on a “proper” production, you would have RAIDs and RAID 5 protection, etc. But unfortunately, we simply didn’t have the money for that, so we just had to make do with what we had. We had to manually copy and paste the files for backup purposes – we basically did this at the end of each day. We also kept a copy of the Final Cut Pro project on two USB thumbdrives just in case. Just for laughs, here’s a photo of some of the drives from our rather odd-ball collection. The top right one is Pinky. We ended up taking the covers off the enclosures as we found they got too hot when in use all day and night long.","Beta 14 introduced Lua scripting - allowing you to programmatically generate whatever text you want!","Big news: Colourlab Ai V3 Creator for Windows and Mac has landed! It's not just an update – it's a game-changer, rebuilt from scratch with a new Ai Color Engine, offering 10x more precision than ever.","Builder NLE v4.1.11 is out now with the following bug fixes:","By printing off the EDL we now had a hard copy of the trailer’s edit – which is always a good thing! But more importantly, it allowed us to easily track and manage everything. Because we couldn’t afford to purchase software such as Crimson Workflow, and we didn’t have time to write up our own proprietary software, we ended up doing a lot of things manually. For instance, we ended up going down the EDL line by line, and exporting a 1920×1080 DPX sequence from REDCINE. We made minor adjustments in REDCINE to get the most clean image and exported away. We put each shot in a different folder based on the EDL number assigned to the shot. For example, the first shot in the trailer was called 001_000001.DPX. This kept things nice and simple. Once every shot was exported out of REDCINE as DPX sequence (which took a night), it was ready for grading!","Carsten Kurpanek posted this really interesting Tweet on his Twitter feed:","Chris!","Color Intelligence writes:","Critical bug fix for loading new clips into the preview player (introduced in version v4.1.10)","From that QuickTime master we than could do any DVD, web, Blu-ray, etc. encodes using Compressor.","Grab Your Gift! Download it free and enjoy a 15-day playtime. Current Colourlab users, you've got a free upgrade waiting in your account.","Gyroscope Stabilisation in Final Cut Pro. Download Gyroflow Toolbox today from the Mac App Store.","Happy Holidays and Happy Grading!","I’m not even sure how this is possible, but we were able to play one video track of 1920×1080 ProRes on the eMac over Firewire 400 in realtime without any issues. And so, we basically edited away for several weeks in Final Cut Pro 6. We ended up doing a very rough grade using the 3-way Colour Corrector just so that when we showed other people to get opinions, they were looking at something that looked half decent. We tried a huge amount of different things in terms of the edit – we used a lot of different music as guide tracks. We even copied the audio from other big Hollywood trailers (such as the Dark Knight) and cut our footage to their soundtrack just to see what we could come up with. It was a very painful, long, but fun and creative process that I certainly won’t forget any time soon!","If you have any questions about the workflow or how we did anything, feel free to post a comment. At some stage in the future we also hope to post some more detailed information on the various visual effects that featured in the trailer, so stay tuned!","In terms of Principle Photography, everything pretty much ran exactly the same as if we were shooting on film. We lit it exactly the same way, and Ben (our DOP) still had his light meter by his side. Because we needed to shoot so much very quickly (time wasn’t on our side), I decided against setting up a “video village” and even a directors monitor – preferring to be there in the action, behind Ben, peaking over his shoulder to watch the on-camera LCD. This worked really well.","Inspired by this Tweet, here's an old blog post I wrote back in December 2008:","It reminds me when I was back in film school in 2008, working on my SAKOOZ feature film proof-of-concept, which we shot on an early RED ONE.","It's still very much a work-in-progress, with the aim to release on the Mac App Store by end of January.","It's terrible, but you can watch the SAKOOZ trailer here:","It's worth having a look through the entire thread, as Carsten gives a lot of interesting insights into this fun workflow.","Merry Christmas Team!","Now with a whole heap of beautifully graded DPX sequences, it was time to do the online. I ended up doing this at University on a nice and speedy MacPro in After Effects CS3. I imported all of the DPX sequences, and then manually put them all in the correct places based on the printed EDL. Once that was complete I simply rendered out a QuickTime File using the Animation Codec. Here is a photo taken at about four o’clock in the morning after I’d been at uni for about forty hours STRAIGHT working on Sakooz. You can see the insanity in my eyes.","Offlining using such high quality media may seem a little silly – I mean, really, we could have done a quarter res transcode to DV, and save a huge amount of time and disk space. Also, considering we were doing the offline on a bunch of eMac’s over Firewire 400 drives (that’s right… really old school eMac’s!), it would have also made the whole editing process a lot more fluid. However! By editing at such a great quality, it meant that whenever we did test screenings or had to show potential investors or sponsors, we could easily burn off a high-quality 1920×1080 QuickTime Movie that looks simply gorgeous even before grading. Here is a photo of our main editing machine.","Once the offline edit was complete, we tidied up the timeline so that everything was on the one track (where possible) and printed off an EDL. This then became our bible. At this stage, all the audio had been done in Final Cut Pro, with the occasional effect being done in Protools LE and Soundtrack Pro, and then exported out as an AIFF. We were still using guide track music.","Originally we had planned to do the grade at one of the major post houses in Melbourne, but due to a lack of time and money, we ended up getting a very talented film school graduate called Nick Reid to do the grade in Apple’s Color. Getting the DPX files into Color proved to be a bit more tricky than anticipated! We ended up purchasing yet another 1TB SATAII drive (called Gizmo) for the colour grade.","Quick Notes:","Season's Greetings, Colour Graders!","Simon Says Transcription v3.9.5 is out now with improved performance and bug fixes.","Syncs with DaVinci Resolve (more compatibility coming soon). January: Adding Premiere and FCP support. February: Pro Release with RAW support, SDI, and Tangent. Requirements: OS13+ or Windows 10.","The Metaburner Pro beta period continues the excitement with new awesome new features in each TestFlight release.","The only thing left to do was sound! Once Frank (our composer) finished, he simply gave us a 24-Bit 48KHz Broadcast Wave File, which we threw into Final Cut Pro. After a bit of tweaking – adjusting the sound effect levels to suit the new score, the sound was ready to rock and roll! Originally we had planned to do a quite complex 5.1 mix just for fun – but at the end of the day, no one was ever going to listen to it in surround sound anyway, so we decided to skip on that idea (for now at least). Once the sound was done, we exported an AIFF and then merged the Animation Codec video and AIFF together to create the Final QuickTime Master!","This wasn’t exactly the quickest workflow in the world (we did a lot of things manually that could have been easily avoided by using software such as Crimson Workflow, plus we used extremely old Mac’s and PC’s in a lot of cases), but a lot of it came down to money vs time. In some cases money won out, but more often than not, we decided to save money and do things the manual way. To be perfectly honest, it actually felt really nice to have a printed out EDL on which to direct everything! It felt much the same as the good old days with film!","We ended up with 16 visual effects in total (including graphics). Once a visual effect shot was completed it was exported as a 1920×1080 DPX sequence ready for grading. For your viewing pleasure, here are some photos of After Effects genius James Otter, working away! I have no idea what the cardboard cartons are for, or where he got them. Needless to say, these photos were taken at some ridiculous early hour of the morning, after James and I had been stuck at uni for AT LEAST forty hours STRAIGHT!","What we ended up doing was wrapping all the DPX files as QuickTimes manually using AJA’s free DPXtoQTTranslator utility. Once all of the DPX’s were wrapped (including all the visual effects), we manually re-created the Final Cut Pro timeline based on the printed EDL using the newly wrapped QuickTime files. We then exported out a XML file from Final Cut Pro. This XML file was brought into Color and grading could commence. Nick took a couple of days to do the grade, and once completed, he handed back Gizmo, ready for the final stages!","When we first started thinking about the best way to put together the Sakooz trailer, we originally thought that Super 16mm and a film scan route would be the most appropriate option given our budget, and the “Hollywood trailer” look that we were after. However, after various camera tests (we’ll post some further information on these tests another time), and a bit of number crunching, it became clear pretty quickly that shooting on the RED ONE was going to achieve better results, cost less and make the post production just that little bit easier (at least in theory) by keeping everything digital. And so, after getting in touch with Cail & Pete from Inspiration Studios, and doing some tests with their brand new toy camera – we decided to shoot the Sakooz trailer on RED.","Whilst I was trying to lock down the picture, others were playing around with the visual effects. Initially, tests and trials were done by the various VFX artists using the ProRes QuickTime files. However, once we had locked down the trailer in terms of the edit, we used REDCINE to export out 4K TIFF sequences and 2K/1K DPX sequences for the visual effects people to work on. Ashley Smart (who did the effects for the Shed Explosion Sequence) was using 4K TIFF Sequences in After Effects on a laptop (which is quite incredible). James Otter used 1K DPX sequences in Nuke, and After Effects to achieve a lot of the effects shots, on a PC. And I used a good old MacBook, running After Effects and Shake to do the remaining shots. I ended up using After Effect’s own tracker for most of the tracking work, although I did use PFTrack for one of the shots. I also used Syntheyes on an old Dell Laptop for a small section of another shot. For Pinky eyes, I ended up brining in 4K DPX sequences into After Effects – which was fairly interesting on the poor old MacBook! But it worked, and the shots came out OK considering…","With the grade now completed, we exported out AJA 10-bit Uncompressed RGB QuickTimes. We then used the AJA QTtoDPXTranslator to unwrap the QuickTime Files back to DPX files. As the AJA tool simply “wraps” the files – it doesn’t transcode them or anything like that, this process is really fast, although you do have to do it manually. For me, that means I have to do everything 69 times which isn’t too bad. The only annoying thing is that you have to rename all the clips again, as Color names everything sequentially, and we wanted everything named as per the bible (i.e. the EDL).","You can download the latest version on the Mac App Store here.","You can learn more and join the TestFlight beta here.","You can learn more here."]},{"l":"22nd December 2023","p":["Final Cut Pro 10.7.1 is out now!","This release includes:","Improves stability on Intel-based Mac models when using Color Wheels or Color Curves on H.264 video clips (reported on FCP Cafe here).","Fixes an issue with some default keyboard shortcuts working incorrectly on non-English keyboards.","Thanks for the fast turnaround Apple!","We'll test it over the coming days and weeks to see if there's any other undocumented changes/fixes.","Builder NLE v4.1.10 is out now with the following bug fixes:","Bug fixes for syncing the preview player with the selected text block after splitting or merging paragraphs","Bug fix for offline media warning dialog","You can download the latest version on the Mac App Store here.","Tight.

This level of customization allows for greater creative freedom, enabling editors to achieve unique visual styles tailored to their specific project needs.","It still sells today because it's useful.","It works.","It's 2023 and everybody should not use XML anymore.","It's a great video, and it's inspired me to reply in more depth, here at FCP Cafe...","It's a very huge and complex file.","It's almost impossible.","It's beautiful that today we have JSON because XML is a pain in the I know what and you know what.","It's in Italian, sorry for everybody who doesn't understand Italian.","It's not an automatic docking that works in one direction because it goes backwards.","It's not complex, it's almost impossible.","It's one of my first apps I ever developed.","It's slightly complex - because you need to communicate between the Custom Share Destination and the Workflow Extension, but certainly achievable.","It's something like an old kind of file because today everything is done by a JSON.","It's something like it goes backward in time.","It's something that hurts my stomach and then I need a lot of malox to survive.","It's super powerful.","It's very, very hard and that's the reason nobody ever done an automatic dacking inside Final Cut Pro because it's hard.","It's very, very hard.","It's worth a read to hear more details about how to speed up exports with simultaneous processing in Final Cut Pro for Mac.","MotionVFX has released mFilmLook v2.0.6 with the following fixes:","Move the Playhead Position","My first app was FCPX AutoDock.","My metadata, finder tags are lost.","My problem is, after the project is finish and I trimmed all the project video files into a smaller segments to archive.","Now Bitmark works all in one direction.","Now I have to run in the rain in my car towards Milan because I have a pre-production meeting for a very very very super strong low-budget product production that I don't want to do.","Observe Changes in the Final Cut Pro Timeline","Ok, so you have Workflow Extensions, Custom Share Destinations, FCPXML and FxPlug.","Ok, that's it, now I run to this meeting and cross your finger for me and I'll keep you updated with the things that I will discover in my research trying to understand how Final Cut Pro thinks using XML.","Okay so yesterday was a very strange day because the night before yesterday I couldn't sleep because my son had a little problem trying to sleep and so it was a blank night.","Okay, there are a lot of stuff like this.","One of the key advantages of FxPlug is its support for high-bit-depth rendering, ensuring that the effects and transitions maintain the highest image quality without degradation. This is particularly important for professionals who require precision and high fidelity in their video projects. Additionally, FxPlug offers real-time performance, a crucial aspect for efficient workflow, allowing editors and motion graphic designers to preview effects without the need for time-consuming rendering.","One of the things I really LOVE about CommandPost is how quick and easy it is to build automation tools.","One potential workaround could be to create a Custom Share Destination, allowing you to export AIFFs of dialogue, music and effects separately, and then the Workflow Extension uses these mix downs for the processing, and then applies the audio adjustments to a Compound Clip of all the audio clips in that role.","Originally developed by Reuel Kim and it is no longer maintained. Pipeline Neo was created as a spin-off project to fix and update the library when necessary.","Pipeline Neo is a Swift framework for working with FCPXML files easily.","Sadly, Custom Share Destinations are terribly documented.","Scott Simmons has updated his ProVideo Coalition article:","Smart Video Splitter","So doing a lot of stuff and I didn't have much time to focus on anything.","So I start trying to understand if there's someone who developed something like a parser for doing this.","So I think this is a some kind of a joke because I'm quite sure that I will never do an app that can do this in a seamless way, in an efficient way, in some way, because it's too hard to produce an automatic dacking.","So the music starts and then after 10 seconds of music, after the introduction, you have the first dialogue.","So the workflow works on my app and then after computation, decision making and something like this, the final work can be done, should be done and must be done in Final Cut Pro.","So today I want to talk about what happened yesterday and because it can be interesting for everybody who's trying to understand why something happens and something doesn't happen in the realm of a Final Cut Pro.","So when there's someone speaking or talking, the music goes down and then after the speech, after the talking, the music returns up in a very elegant and seamless way.","Something like a complete and total description of what happens in the timeline, in the event, in the library.","Subtitles Extractor","Thankfully, I happened to have a very old Apple sample project saved in my backups that demonstrates how this works - which has since sadly disappeared from the Internet.","That's all for today and as always I say... Ciao! Oh, remember to comment this video, like this video, subscribe to the channel, blah blah blah, all the stuff that all the good YouTubers do.","The interface is old, maybe ugly.","The main focus of the video is on my exploration of integrating automatic ducking into Final Cut Pro. I reflect on my past app, FCPX AutoDuck, and express the desire to enhance its functionality by making it work within Final Cut Pro. I detail the complexities of the task, involving parsing FCP XML and dealing with intricate timelines, nested timelines, and various editing techniques. I acknowledge the difficulty of achieving automatic ducking within Final Cut Pro, emphasizing the absence of this feature even in the latest versions.","The music goes up and then it fades out.","The video concludes with a mention of a pre-production meeting in Milan and my reluctance to take on low-budget, demanding projects. I express concerns about the future of Final Cut Pro, hinting at a possible decline.","The YouTube description says:","Then the dialogue finishes and then the music goes on for other 10 seconds.","There are a lot of apps that work inside of Final Cut Pro or using Final Cut Pro data and so they can take data from Final Cut Pro, computate them and then send them back to Final Cut.","There are third party frameworks for dealing with FCPXML too...","There is a diverse range of applications, and can vary widely in function, including tools for media asset management, stock footage libraries, music services, transcription services, and more. This variety allows editors to tailor their workflow according to their specific needs.","There's a ton, a ton, a super ton of way of doing a single simple timeline, a common timeline, a normal timeline that you will do in your project.","There's also Custom Share Destinations, which is something I've been digging into deeply recently, to help out Vigneswaran Rajkumar for his exciting upcoming app, Marker Data.","There's also DAWFileKit- a Swift library for reading and writing common import/export file formats between popular DAW and video editing applications with the ability to convert between formats.","They provide seamless integration as they appear as panels within the Final Cut Pro interface. This means editors can use third-party tools and services without leaving Final Cut Pro, maintaining a smooth and uninterrupted editing workflow. Their window position also gets saved in any saved Workspaces.","Think about it, even Apple didn't do an automatic dacking for Final Cut Pro because there's so much you have to understand, to learn, to figure out.","This is a very simple timeline.","This is all possible, and somewhat easy to do.","This is just a video podcast.","This is the perfect problem for something like CommandPost to solve, via it's powerful Lua scripting.","This Workflow Extension is super simple - it's just in Objective-C, and uses web-sockets to communicate back and forth between the Workflow Extension and CommandPost.","Tight.

As in 2023, we’ll be visiting Apple Park as part of the 2024 conference.","With the home base back at the Juniper Hotel, we once again have a bar in the same building as all the talks, and it’s also where most of us will be staying. With many restaurant options in easy walking distance, we should have many more chances for casual and unplanned hangouts with speakers, attendees and special guests.","Dates have shifted a little later this year, and it’s being held from 13-15 November 2024. As in 2023, we’ll kick off with Apple Day; a keynote, then a visit to Apple Park where we will be shown something. Since Spatial Video support has been promised this year, I’d expect there’s a fair chance we’ll see it in action at the Summit, presumably along with other new features, and the latest Macs and other gear in the demo room.","(An aside: is Spatial a big deal? It will be, eventually. I’m a big fan of the Apple Vision Pro today, and if you’ve not tried it yet, definitely do try one out. Yes, it’s expensive, but the experience it brings is unlike anything else, and it will become cheaper eventually. Craving something new? This is it.)","If you largely live online, or (like me) on the other side of the planet, it’s worth getting together with a bunch of like-minded editors every now and again. Online is OK, and yes, you can learn new things there, but food, drink, and proximity to actual people can’t be replaced. I won’t be the only Australian there either — Chris Hocking, the kind and benevolent person behind this site and CommandPost, is coming again this year. Be sure to say hi, and if you’re not already supporting CommandPost, buy him a drink!","After Apple Day, we’ll still have two days of talks, plus panels, special guests, and a tip show. I’m giving two talks this year, teaching you how to Make Useful Editing Tools with Motion on Thursday, and then on Friday 3D, Spatial and Immersive Video. The full program has some great talks scheduled. I’m personally very keen to learn how the Fitness+ team use FCP, to hear what Strada’s Michael Cioni has to say, and for the chat with Tyler Stalman before the closed-doors-no-recording-gloves-off Q&A with the FCP team.","If you’re an FCP editor, and you travel for just one video event a year, I think this is more fun than NAB — and it’s all about the people.

It’s not because it’s the best in-person FCP event of the year, though it is. It’s not even because you get to visit Apple and talk to the FCP team. Nope, because it’s the best place to make connections in the Final Cut Pro world, and because we haven’t had one of these since 2019.

They have worked very hard for over a decade on making Final Cut Pro better and better. This open letter is aimed at the executives who set the priorities of the Final Cut Pro development team and the Apple managers whose policies limit the public marketing of Final Cut Pro to a couple of website updates a year and some mentions in Apple keynotes about how much faster Apple hardware is getting.","The letter’s signatories aim was to encourage Apple to make a new commitment to the professional TV and filmmaking industry. They believe that would potentially benefit filmmakers the world over regardless of their personal NLE preferences.","Competition is a positive. Apple has demonstrated a willingness to swing big. The very fact that they are not exclusively tethered to our industry allows them to try things others likely can’t. We hope you’ll support us in encouraging one of the heaviest hitters in media and technology to more forcefully push the boundaries of all of our tools.","They gathered some comments about Final Cut Pro and Apple:","Galliano Olivier, editor of ‘Marianne,’ a French TV drama series edited in Final Cut and distributed by Netflix says “In France, it is extremely difficult to get permission to edit TV with Final Cut Pro. You can’t use it without fighting producers, directors, post-production supervisors, sound editors, etc...”","Knut Hake BFS, editor of ‘Blood Red Sky,’ a feature film distributed by Netflix and edited using Final Cut Pro commented, “I think it would make a big difference for workflow consultants, systems integrators and third-party developers if there was a public Beta program for Final Cut Pro. Apple already do it for iOS, macOS and even Safari. It would make Final Cut more reliable and make it much easier for people to fit Final Cut into their plans for the future.”","Steven Sanders, editor in chief of of the Fox TV series ‘War of the Worlds’ season 3 said “The two main reasons why I am often not allowed to chose my favourite editing application, which is Final Cut Pro are: 1. Collaboration! Editing big productions needs collaboration. Different users have to be able to access the same library at the same time. There is no way around this. Avid Media Composer does it and even DaVinci Resolve does it. Apple still targets the single user. They have to change that. That will change everything. 2. Many professionals do not know how Final Cut works. They are afraid of it, even regard is as ‘iMovie Pro.’ I hear that all the time in my business. This perception really has to change.\"","Vanessa E. Brogna, assistant editor of ‘Bridgerton’ one of the top TV shows on Netflix commented: “Final Cut Pro is my favorite NLE. It's an absolute powerhouse and I feel the most creative and productive. Doing one step in Final Cut is about 3-4 in other NLEs. However, the real magic of Final Cut is its free form style of editing.

If codecs aren't optimized for editing it is transcoding them \"on the fly\". Some, like mp3, are immediately transcoded into an optimized version.","However, for best results regarding playback, rendering and export, we recommend using the Apple Pro Res family, since Apple Silicon has dedicated chips for encoding/decoding Pro Res. For bigger projects Pro Res LT seems to be the best option between data size and quality. If you got the storage capacity and speed you even can edit in Pro Res HQ or higher.","There is even a point to be made for HEVC and even h.264 (both in .mov container!) as an editing codec in FCP. No recommendation here, but we are aware of h.264-workflows that are running smoothly since years. In this case the transcoding from original files has to be meticulously tested, to ensure that timecode sync and rendering quality is preserved. Using a Quicktime container would also be mandatory, to ensure metadata is preserved along the way.","Also, for larger projects with a postproduction pipeline after editing (external Color Grading, Sound Design etc.) we recommend a strict procedure in using the same codecs all the time. It will save you a lot of headaches after the fact, regarding metadata export, relinking to original files and AAF export (via X2pro). All these workflows to Sound Design and Color Grading should be tested properly before the start of editing.","We also highly recommend a pipeline that uses only one set of codecs going in to the edit, preferably Pro Res for Video and PCM (.wav or .aiff container) for Audio. That means to transcode any Video or Audio that is not in the correct codec before importing into FCP. We especially warn about using mp3-files in any edit that will be sent to Pro Tools! A single clip of mp3 can delay your export workflow for hours of troubleshooting. Stick with PCM aka WAV or AIFF.","Once you’ve got your clips imported to FCP you can use the inbuilt Proxy Workflow to conveniently reduce file sizes, for example for travel, and to take off an edge of demanding editing or rendering tasks. There's also a workflow for getting Proxies rendered outside of FCP, for example in Davinci Resolve (tbd).","For so-called reference clips (also: ref-QT), exports you send to review or to postproduction with burned-in timecode so they can match your edit with original files, HEVC (h.265) is a no-brainer. It’s just the best quality to file size ratio and even export is very fast. Hint: with Apple Compressor you can build your own HEVC export-templates for FCP with your preferred data rate.

Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used ones, like \"i\" for setting an in-point, \"o\" for an out-point, and \"space\" for play/pause.","Use Proxy Media: When dealing with high-resolution video like 4K or 8K, editing can become sluggish. Use Final Cut Pro's proxy media feature, which allows you to create lower-resolution versions of your footage for smoother editing. When you're done, you can switch back to the full-resolution media for final output.","Organize Your Media: Keep your footage and assets well-organized. Use libraries, events, and keywords to categorize and manage your footage. This will make finding and accessing the clips you need much faster.","Use Presets: If you find yourself often applying the same settings or effects, save them as presets. This can be done for color grading, audio effects, and more.","Optimize Your Hardware: Make sure your computer is up to the task. Keep your software up to date, ensure you have enough free storage space, and consider upgrades to your RAM or GPU if necessary.","Batch Operations: Perform tasks such as transcoding, rendering, and exporting in batches, ideally during downtime, to avoid interrupting your editing flow.","Learn to Use the Magnetic Timeline: The magnetic timeline is one of Final Cut Pro's unique features. It helps maintain synchronization when moving clips around, which can save you time rearranging your timeline.","Color Coding: Use color coding for your clips and timelines. This can help you quickly locate related material or sequences.","Use the Skimming Feature: The skimming feature allows you to quickly review your footage and makes cutting and trimming faster.","Storyboard Your Videos: Before even starting with Final Cut Pro, have a clear idea of what you want to achieve.

Aside from slow drives, too less RAM or bad media management, it is the sheer amount of clips (Audio and Video) in a timeline that could hit on performance. It's hard to pin-point exactly, but it starts from around 500 assets (clips, titles, effects) in the timeline.","Apple Silicon Macs do perform significantly better than Intel Macs. With M1 Pro/Max+ timelines of 40-60 minutes should be no problem.","there are several tricks and workarounds to keep long timelines without lags","workarounds","RAM should increase with the lengths of your projects. Though it's possible to edit 90 minutes with 16 GB, we would recommend 32-64 GB of RAM with feature-length timelines. This reduces the risk of freezes, when FCP has to suddenly load big Events.","working in reels:","You can segment your timeline into regions of around 20-25 minutes and put them into Compound Clips. Inside the Compounds you drive the edit. \"Outside\" the Compounds you compose the film. For example you could try out different styles of music. With smart Role-management you can turn on/off different music types, for example. important note: before export, you always have to check the joints between the reels.","stay snappy:","With the aforementioned reels-system you could have even 3-hour-timelines. you also could temporarily put a segment of the edit into a Compound to work faster and break it apart afterwards.","stay snappier:","We are big fans of transcoding beforehand.

Known for its powerful capabilities and intuitive interface, Final Cut Pro has come a long way since its inception. Today, let's explore this extraordinary journey of innovation and technological progression."]},{"l":"The Genesis of an Idea","p":["The story begins with Randy Ubillos, a name widely associated with the creation of the first three versions of Adobe Premiere Pro. His team's knack for developing professional video editing programs was then recognized by Macromedia, leading them to embark on a new project, KeyGrip.","KeyGrip was a more professional video editing program, built on Apple's QuickTime, which was intended for Macromedia's portfolio. However, due to licensing issues with Truevision, and Macromedia's shift towards web market solutions, the project hit a roadblock. Macromedia decided to sell its desktop applications, including the embryonic KeyGrip."]},{"l":"Birth of the Final Cut Pro","p":["In a pivotal year of 1998, KeyGrip was renamed Final Cut, and showcased as a 0.9 alpha version at the NAB Show. With no buyers, Apple, recognizing the potential of the software, stepped in and acquired the development team.","Contrary to expectations, Apple continued the development work, despite the lack of a buyer. The team made significant enhancements to the software, such as adding FireWire support, and finally, in 1999, it was released as Final Cut Pro at the NAB show."]},{"l":"Building a Community","p":["To ensure that Final Cut Pro received solid support from the start, Apple adopted an aggressive marketing and training strategy. They joined forces with DVcreators.net to launch a training disc, \"Final Cut Pro PowerStart\", and hosted hundreds of free and paid seminars worldwide. This strategy significantly boosted the software's early market visibility and success.","During this time, Final Cut Pro also capitalized on the decline of Adobe Premiere in the Mac market. A strategic trade-in program in 2003 allowed Adobe Premiere users to switch to Final Cut Express for free or avail of a hefty discount on Final Cut Pro."]},{"l":"Pioneering Broadcast Quality","p":["A defining factor in the success of Final Cut Pro was the robust QuickTime platform, particularly its support for new DV cameras connected via FireWire. The software found its application in the production of the first fully broadcast quality, globally distributed TV show, Women of Wrestling in 2000. Networks, such as Oxygen, also adopted the software to produce shows like SheCommerce.","By 2003, Final Cut Pro was credited for facilitating the production of the controversial film \"PlayCouples, A New Era of Swinging\". The software demonstrated its reliability during the film rendering, and this positive experience led to more endorsements from industry professionals. Such endorsements boosted its acceptance as a professional editing tool and culminated in a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its influence on the television industry in 2002."]},{"l":"The Evolution of Final Cut Pro","p":["Final Cut Pro continued to evolve, with the 4th version in 2003, introducing new applications such as Compressor, LiveType, and Soundtrack for advanced editing needs. Over time, the software strengthened its support for various video formats and integrated with additional tools to provide a comprehensive editing solution.","By 2006, Apple stopped selling Final Cut Pro as a standalone product, making it available only as part of the Final Cut Studio bundle. It also introduced the universal binary version, enhancing the software's flexibility and performance.","Subsequent versions, Final Cut Pro 6 and 7, introduced in 2007 and 2009 respectively, brought more functionalities and integrations. Despite its growing capabilities, the software remained a 32-bit application until Final Cut Pro 7."]},{"i":"final-cut-pro-x-a-revolution-in-the-editing-world","l":"Final Cut Pro X: A Revolution in the Editing World","p":["In 2011, Apple launched a major new iteration of its popular video editing software - Final Cut Pro X. This version represented a significant departure from its predecessors, bringing both praise and criticism for its novel approach."]},{"l":"The Launch and Initial Response","p":["The launch of Final Cut Pro X(also known as FCPX or FCP 10) in June 2011, stirred up quite a controversy within the industry. The significant changes implemented by Apple shook many long-time users. Some of the main points of contention were the lack of backward compatibility with projects from previous versions and the initial absence of features like multi-cam editing and the ability to edit tape-based media.","Notably, there was also a transition in the distribution model, as Apple decided to make the software available only via download through the Mac App Store.

In this post, we will explore the best practices for using Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing. This will ensure your workflow is optimized, your output is professional, and your editing process is efficient."]},{"l":"Organise Your Workflow","p":["Create a Sound Workflow Structure:","Before starting the editing process, it's crucial to establish a well-structured workflow. In the context of long-form feature films, this often involves breaking down your project into scenes or sequences, each with its own dedicated project file within Final Cut Pro. This allows for focused editing and simplifies collaboration, as different editors can work on different scenes simultaneously.","Consistent Naming Conventions:","Consistency is key to smooth editing, especially for large projects like feature films. Use consistent naming conventions for your clips, sequences, and projects. This will make it much easier to locate and identify specific assets as your project grows.","Leverage Metadata:","Final Cut Pro allows users to input and leverage metadata for clips, such as scene number, shot number, take number, and more. You can also add custom metadata. Using metadata effectively can greatly enhance organization and searchability within your project."]},{"l":"Understanding RAM Requirements","p":["One crucial aspect of achieving optimal performance with Final Cut Pro revolves around understanding and addressing the software's RAM requirements. In particular, running FCP on Apple silicon (Apple's own line of processors) requires careful consideration. As all new Macs now use Apple silicon, it's important to get this right.","Apple Silicon and Unified Memory:","Unlike traditional computer architecture, where the CPU and GPU have separate memory (RAM and VRAM), Apple Silicon uses a unified memory architecture. This means that the CPU and GPU share the same pool of memory. As a result, your RAM has to serve the needs of both processing and graphics tasks.","For long-form feature film editing in Final Cut Pro, this has several implications:","Greater RAM demands: Feature films require handling high-resolution footage, multiple video tracks, complex effects, and color grading, among others. These tasks can put significant strain on your RAM.","Multitasking needs: If you are using other demanding apps alongside Final Cut Pro, such as other creative apps, your RAM needs will be even higher.","Importance of choosing the right Mac model: When buying an Apple Silicon Mac, you can't upgrade the RAM later, unlike with some previous Intel-based Mac models. So, it's important to consider your RAM needs upfront.","How Much RAM Do You Need?","As a baseline, Apple recommends a minimum of 8GB RAM for Final Cut Pro:","4GB of RAM (8GB recommended for 4K editing, 3D titles and 360° video editing)","However, for long-form feature film editing, you'll likely need more.","16GB RAM: This should be considered the minimum for professional work, such as editing feature films. It will allow for smooth editing of 4K footage and some flexibility for multitasking.","32GB RAM or higher: If you're working with 6K, 8K, or multiple streams of 4K video, or if you use lots of effects, consider 32GB or even 64GB of RAM. These larger RAM options will also provide greater flexibility for heavy multitasking and future-proof your setup as software demands increase over time.","At LateNite we're primarily using MacBook Pro's (2021 16-inch, Apple M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 3TB SSD), and they're rock solid.","While the unified memory architecture in Apple Silicon offers advantages such as increased efficiency and speed, it also places greater demands on your system's RAM. Therefore, when planning to use Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing on an Apple Silicon Mac, consider opting for at least 16GB of RAM, or even 32GB or 64GB for more complex projects and improved future-proofing. Remember, it's better to have a bit more RAM than you need, rather than not having enough when you need it most."]},{"l":"Understanding Drive Requirements","p":["An often underappreciated factor that can significantly impact your video editing workflow is the type of storage you use. When it comes to editing in Final Cut Pro, especially long-form feature film editing, opting for a Solid State Drive (SSD) over a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) can make a significant difference.","Choosing the Right Storage for Final Cut Pro: SSDs Over Spinning Disks:","External SSDs: High-capacity external SSDs have become increasingly affordable. They can be an excellent solution for expanding your storage space without having to replace your internal drive.","Faster Read/Write Speeds: SSDs offer dramatically faster data transfer rates compared to HDDs. This means that video files can be read, copied, and written much quicker, which is critical when dealing with large, high-resolution video files typical in feature film editing.","Greater Reliability: Because they have no moving parts, SSDs are less likely to suffer mechanical failures, making them more reliable than HDDs. This is critical when working on important projects like feature films, where data loss can be disastrous.","HDDs, or hard disk drives, are traditional storage devices that use mechanical, moving parts to read and write data. They are made up of spinning disks, hence the name \"spinning disks.\" HDDs are typically slower and less reliable (due to potential mechanical failure), but they usually offer more storage space for a lower price.","Improved Multitasking: SSDs are better at handling multiple tasks simultaneously, such as playing back multiple video streams, which is common in multicam editing or when working with complex timelines.","In 2023, you should definitely be removing slow spinning disks from your editing workflow entirely. (You might still choose to use them for backup.)","Manage Storage Space: SSDs typically have less space than HDDs. Be diligent about deleting rendered files, proxies, and other temporary files that Final Cut Pro generates during editing to free up space.","On the other hand, SSDs, or solid-state drives, are storage devices that use flash memory (similar to your smartphone or USB thumb drive) to store data. Because there are no moving parts, SSDs are significantly faster and more reliable than HDDs. However, they are also typically more expensive per gigabyte.","Practical Tips for Using SSDs with Final Cut Pro:","Quicker Rendering and Exporting: The faster speeds of SSDs also translate to quicker rendering and exporting times in Final Cut Pro. This is particularly important in a professional setting, where time is often of the essence.","The Advantages of SSDs for Final Cut Pro","Understanding HDDs vs SSDs:","While HDDs may be more cost-effective in terms of raw storage space, the speed, and reliability benefits offered by SSDs make them a superior choice for use with Final Cut Pro, especially for demanding tasks like long-form feature film editing.","While SSDs are clearly advantageous for video editing, it's important to use them strategically to balance performance and cost:","Working Drive: If you can't afford a large SSD, consider at least getting a smaller one to use as a 'working drive'. You can store your current project on the SSD for fast performance, then move finished projects to an HDD for long-term storage."]},{"l":"Storage Locations","p":["To keep library sizes as small as possible (which makes backing them up and sharing them easier), we always recommend keeping your media and cache external to the library.","Storing your media inside the library is an option for solo editors who do not work collaboratively, but external media offers more power and flexibility."]},{"l":"Library Organisation","p":["Each event in Final Cut Pro is its own Core Data database.","You can learn more about the library structure.","Given this, we recommend splitting up your media into multiple events, rather than putting all your media in a single event powered by a single database.","We recommend using emojis in event names, to differentiate the list of events more clearly.","For example, this is from a 5 x 30min broadcast television special:","You can learn more about Chris Hocking's workflow.","Here's an example of a library for a job where all the user interface designs were build in Final Cut Pro for a game:","Here's an example of a library for a basic corporate edit:","If you're working on a very heavy feature film, your current feature length timeline should be in its own event."]},{"l":"Avoid Snapshots","p":["Snapshots are the devil. You're much better off using something like PostLab.","When you duplicate a project as a snapshot, Final Cut Pro embeds copies of compound or multicam “parent” clips in the duplicate, so any changes to other instances of those clips do not affect the duplicate.","Generally speaking, when you're working with a long-form project, all of your media is generally a Multicam Clip (because you're syncing with external audio) — so each time you create a Snapshot you're essentially creating a duplicate of all the clips metadata.","When you create a Snapshot, Final Cut Pro generates copies of your used clips and any connected clips, including titles, effects, compound clips, and multicam clips. All of these elements contribute to the overall size of the Snapshot.","While Snapshots can be a valuable tool for preserving your project's state at a specific point in time, excessive use can have a significant impact on your library size and performance. This can in turn affect Final Cut Pro's performance.","An overly large Final Cut Pro library can lead to several issues:","Reduced System Performance: A bloated library can slow down Final Cut Pro's performance, making it less responsive and lengthening render and export times.","Limited Storage Space: If your library size becomes excessively large, it can occupy a substantial portion of your available storage space. This can be particularly problematic if you're working with limited storage capacities, such as on a laptop with a small SSD.","Back-up Challenges: Large libraries can also be more challenging to back up, as they require more storage space and more time to copy to your backup drive."]},{"l":"Edit with Proxy Media","p":["Long-form editing, particularly at high resolutions (4K, 8K), can be quite demanding on system resources. To ensure a smooth editing experience, Final Cut Pro offers a 'proxy workflow'. This allows you to create lower-resolution versions (proxies) of your footage for editing. Once the editing is complete, you can easily switch back to the original high-resolution files for final output."]},{"l":"Use the Magnetic Timeline","p":["The Magnetic Timeline is one of the unique features of Final Cut Pro. It offers a trackless approach to editing, allowing clips to automatically slide into place and avoid clip collisions and sync problems. This is particularly useful in feature film editing, where you may be juggling hundreds or even thousands of clips."]},{"l":"Master Your Tools and Shortcuts","p":["Final Cut Pro offers a wide range of tools for tasks such as trimming, re-timing, and applying effects. Mastering these tools, along with the keyboard shortcuts for commonly used functions, can significantly speed up your editing process."]},{"i":"leverage-final-cut-pros-multicam-editing","l":"Leverage Final Cut Pro's Multicam Editing","p":["If your film includes footage from multiple cameras, Final Cut Pro's Multicam editing feature can be a major time-saver. It allows you to sync up to 64 angles of video footage using audio waveforms, timecode, or markers. Once synced, you can cut between angles in real time while watching the multicam viewer."]},{"i":"use-compound-clips-and-roles-for-organisation--efficiency","l":"Use Compound Clips and Roles for Organisation & Efficiency","p":["Compound Clips allow you to bundle separate clips together into a single clip, which can then be edited as one. This is useful for managing complex sequences or visual effects compositions.","Roles in Final Cut Pro allow you to label and organize different types of audio such as dialogue, effects, and music. When exporting, you can output multiple versions of your mix (such as stereo and surround) or a file with separated roles for further mixing or mastering."]},{"l":"Keep Regular Backups","p":["Given the scale and importance of feature film projects, it's essential to keep regular backups of your work. Final Cut Pro's built-in backup tool makes this process easy and automatic. Backups can be accessed from the File > Open Library > From Backup command, but they can also be found in the Finder, in Home > Movies > Final Cut Backups > LIBRARYNAME."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Final Cut Pro is a powerful tool for long-form feature film editing, but like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used. By adopting these best practices, you can ensure that your editing process is efficient, your workflow is smooth, and the end result is a feature film of professional quality. Remember, the key to successful film editing is a combination of technical skill, organization, creativity, and storytelling.","Want to contribute?

I managed to negotiate 29 minutes!","In an early conversation with editor Mona Gesbel (they/them), we decided we needed to work in an environment which was fluid, nimble, and most of all stable.","My earlier feature films have been edited on the Avid Film Composer. Yaniv Dabach the editor on my feature 'Road, Movie' wanted to edit on Final Cut 7 (he has now switched back to Avid), while my other editor Antara Lahiri works mostly on Adobe Premiere for Netflix and Amazon Prime with her feature projects edited on Avid.","I had been curious about the development of the new Final Cut Pro. I had tried it a few times but something didn’t quite stick. And Walter (Murch) had also moved away from it. I kept an older Mac Pro (2008-2010) which still runs Final Cut Studio.","It was after making a smaller film for the Met during the pandemic which was edited on DaVinci Resolve - and not a great experience - that I thought I should revisit Final Cut Pro.","Why did FCP not stick? Why was I resisting? Why did I dislike it? Gesbel and I decided to approach this with an open mind. The pandemic also gave us a quiet time to review our reservations.","This time around things were different. Once we accepted the new nomenclature; Library, Event, Project, we got into keywords and favoriting. That was a game changer. The world of sub-clips, and bins opened up in an almost transformative way. Keywords reminded me of Aperture my favorite photo processing app by far.","We saw the short videos by Thomas Grove Carter which were incredibly helpful and on his recommendation bought the Ripple Training course so we could dive deeper.","We decided this film would be cut on Final Cut Pro.

We would duplicate timelines. An Event would store all the older timelines, in the event (!) we had to go back to an older edit."]},{"l":"Some Struggle","p":["Sometimes we faced issues with connected clips. We would forget about changing clip connections when we wanted to move a clip, leave the connections behind and not want everything to close the gap. We figured that out.

With a little help from CommandPost, Sam and Knut can create a keyword for each line of dialogue, then attach these keywords to specific parts of each shot, and then gather all the shots for each specific line of dialogue in a custom keyword collection. It’s not quite the same as Avid’s ScriptSync, but it accomplishes similar goals.","Knut Hake (editor) and Sam Pluemacher (assistant editor) have been behind a few Netflix films now — all in German, and directed by Peter Thorwarth. There’s 2021’s Blood Red Sky, 2023's Blood and Gold, and the freshly released Sixty Minutes, out now.","Lastly, if you’re considering using FCP to cut a feature for Netflix, it’s actually possible. You’ll need to prove that you know your workflow as well as Knut and Sam do, and you should probably check out Knut’s Notion workflow for feature film editing.","Many thanks to Chris Hocking for making this workflow possible in CommandPost.","Many thanks to Knut and Sam, and congratulations on your repeated success!","Next, automatically assemble all those clips, sorted by timecode into a fresh timeline — a dailies stringout, in order of shooting. CommandPost’s Auto Sequence Toolbox does this trick, and was developed specifically for Knut and Sam to support this workflow.","Now, you’ll have a Keyword Collection for every line of dialog, numbered in order, with good takes marked as favorites and bad takes rejected. Keywords and Ratings are a fantastic advantage of using Final Cut Pro, and CommandPost can help you to use your script to create those keywords quickly.","Start with Sync-N-Link X from Intelligent Assistance. This tool can batch-sync a day’s worth of jam-synced audio and video clips, and it’s a big time saver here.","That dailies timeline now has all the different takes of each scene, numbered and waiting to be tagged with the day’s scripts. Manual keywording would be very time consuming, so use CommandPost again. First, the lines in the script will be placed into titles, and then, those titles will be placed above each of the shots, to match each line exactly.","The titles are set to become keywords, but you can also create titles named FAVORITE or REJECT to apply those ratings too. Multiple titles can be placed atop the same clip; they’ll all turn into keywords or ratings.","These films were all cut in Final Cut Pro, and made use of CommandPost to help the process along.","This is, however, not a text-recognition system, there’s no AI involved, and it’s not text-based editing. In a script-first workflow, you want to organise the clips based on the script, even if there’s improvisation.","Timing and positioning these titles is the only manual part of the process, but it’s not difficult to duplicate a storyline with titles from one scene to another take, then perform minor retiming on the duplicate titles.","To get started, head to the CommandPost Toolbox, choose Titles to Keywords, and look in the lower half of the panel, called Create Titles from Text. Paste in all the script lines that you want to generate titles for, and CommandPost will automatically number these lines, in order, with an optional prefix and suffix, then send these titles to Final Cut Pro.","When it’s all complete, head back to the Titles to Keywords toolbox and use the top half of the panel to create a new Event with Keywords.","Written by Iain Anderson."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"blood--gold","l":"Blood & Gold","p":["Final Cut Pro to After Effects VFX Workflow","Blood & Gold premiered on Netflix on Friday May 26th 2023.

Therefore I was looking for tools that would allow for quick pre-visualization turnovers once Knut and Peter finished sequences that I could start working on.","I found Ximport AE by Automatic Duck on FxFactory which makes the process of sending plates or rough layouts as easy as exporting a fcpxml and importing it into After Effects.","Once a sequence is ready to be worked on, I will create compound clips for our VFX shots and name them accordingly - e.g. \"BAG_001-0010\". Compound clips are great for VFX shots, because any changes inside the compound clip will automatically be reflected in all instances of that compound clip. I will usually add 24 frames of handles to each VFX shot as it gives Knut some flexibility in the editing process.","The compound clips will also show up in your browser and in order to get these layouts over to After Effects, you simply select all shots and export a fcpxml.","Over in After Effects you select \"Import... > Ximport AE...\" and start the import process. This only takes a few seconds and all your compound clips will be imported as Compositions right away. You will also find the original media files next to those. There's a few settings in the import dialogue, but I mostly keep them at default. As Ximport AE references the original media files, you can always adjust the length of any clip in your AE Composition. This is super helpful and an added benefit compared to working with exported/rendered clips.","Open your Composition and you will find all your layers inside, as well as a marker showing you any effect that was applied in Final Cut Pro. Not only does it preserve the layers and timing of your shots, but it will also import the audio of your Synchronized/Multicam clips. This was very helpful on this project, because there were a lot of muzzle flashes that needed to fit to the sound layout.","After organizing and checking all my imported Comps I could quickly start working on the pre-visualizations. Here's a few examples:","Once the work on a shot was done, I'd color-label the shots in After Effects. Using Templates and presets I was quickly able to add the shots to the Render Queue and export them to a pre-defined folder.","Back in Final Cut Pro I would import the shots and assign them to our \"VFX-Previz\" role. All shots then go into their respective compound clip. The compound clips also act as a reference for which clips have been used for a specific composition. This is extremely helpful once you need to turnover the shots to your VFX vendor.","It also allows me to add versions to the compound clips and easily toggle them on or off directly in the timeline without searching for them in the browser.","Whenever there were editing changes or shots changed significantly, I would simply export a new fcpxml (name them by date or version number) and import them into After Effects. Ximport AE will create new folders for each import which makes it very organized and lets you keep track of each iteration.","That's about it.

I now have all assets I need to proceed:","Fast forward to the interesting part of delivery preparation: The simple roles setup is enough to immediately export different assets such as clean-feed or M&E (music and effects) tracks.","Firstly, I of course finished the Director’s Cut, also known as ‘cinema version’. The original 23,98p UHD (4K 16:9) material was edited in a 2K flat 1998x1080 native 24p project (audio set to stereo). FCP working its magic already, the frame rate conform happens automatically and without hick-ups in the background. the extra resolution gave more details when scaled down and noise was reduced. I also had more room for stabilization, framing and ‘ken-burnsing’ that way.","Organization: As commonly done, I created events for corresponding steps in post-production. Through the use of ‘Folder Names as Keywords’ during import I could start editing right away because we took the time of naming folders when copying media to the source drive. I could easily find people, location and topics that way. My process now starts which is not using any typical media management methods besides favorite ranges or in/out points in the browser. I like to assemble groups of clips in the project with gaps in between to move parts around creatively.","Screenshot 1A","Screenshot 1A: The original 24p cinema timeline. Note the clearly assigned roles: For video there are two different types of archive material (different sources) which do not have any other purpose other than source referencing (aka ‘clippings’). The ‘Titles’ role includes all on-screen text like lower thirds, fullscreen inserts, credits or titles. For audio all elements are grouped as well with red being English narration (voice-over). The SRT track includes subtitles for all non-English dialogue.","Screenshot 1B","Screenshot 1B: The original 24p cinema timeline as its own project with audio lanes enabled.","Screenshot 2","Screenshot 2: Now with roles being set, the real power of FCP’s export (share) window comes into play. Switching to ‘Separate Files’ I exported the following: A ProRes HQ clean video file, aka ‘clean-feed’, which includes everything BUT titles (important for localizations of TV channels per on territory). Note that the ‘titles’ role is missing. And the most important part is audio tracks (or ‘stems’ in this case), which are created easily that way. I will end up with 4 files, 3 of which being audio, separated into: Speech (original dialogue and extra recorded narration/voice-over), Effects (all the ambience, atmospherics or SFX I placed manually or were recorded on location) and Music. Music & Effects are stereo tracks, Speech is mono, so a total of 6 channels. It should be clear now which purpose this will server a little later on: A rough, home-made 5.1 Surround up-mix from pure stereo sources for a better cinematic experience. Last but not least: All subtitles/captions as separate SRT files per language (English and German in my case).","Screenshot 3","Screenshot 3: In a new surround (!) project I assemble the just exported stereo audio files and use FCP’s unique and genius surround panner in the inspector (set to the respective purposes) as displayed in the next screenshots. Note: I also export a special M&E stereo track now, which is a combination of all sound effects/atmospherics and music, hence the name ‘music and effects’. TV needs this for dubbing their own language version. They would re-mix audio after adding their own voice-over and synchro. Same for surround. Tedious, I know, but necessary.","Screenshot 3A","Screenshot 3B","Screenshot 3C","Screenshot 4","Screenshot 4: In yet another project (still 2K flat 24p but set to surround) I copy&paste all titles on top of the re-imported clean-feed, which I also added the ‘Broadcast Safe’ effect set to standard ‘0’ to. I also re-import the captions and prepared audio files. Now I have full control over ‘versioning’, which means cinema or broadcast/streaming in ‘clean’ or ‘fixed’ English.","Screenshots 3A-C: The presets for Dialogue (tuned to 90), Ambience and Music delivery a solid, yet quick & dirty, way to create a 5.1 surround mix by spreading audio signals over all channels but keeping speech mainly in front (center speaker behind the cinema screen). Note: You need a separate voice/dialogue track for this, hence the before mentioned preparation. I would not recommend this (although it is possible and works OK) for just a single stereo mix – if you want to up-mix one single stereo mix, you should choose ‘create space’ as the preset instead.","Secondly, I knew in the end we need to conform to a 52 minutes TV version (Central-European broadcast standard length for docs) and to 25p (which happens by a 4% speed change - what has always been done since the invention of analogue TV), so I needed a 55 minutes for the cinema master in 24p (the FPS conform would take care of the length automatically due to speed up of 4%). To exactly hit 52 minutes I would just adjust the length of credits (scrolling speed) in the very end. For audio improvement I usually use Voice Isolation at 50% combined with the EQ set to ‘Tremble Boost’ – at least for our wireless Sony mics this gives crisp and clear speech.","Setup: The SDR library is located on the internal SSD as well as all cache files, library backups, export renders and transcodes. Nothing gets stored inside the library so that it stays small and fast. For the amount of 600 GB source media, the library clocks in at under 500 MB stat way. All source media is fed from an external RAID (HDD) or portable LaCie SSD.","SRT captions for subtitles (sidecar files)","Stereo mix of everything but also Stereo M&E","Surround mix of everything, but also Surround M&E","Thirdly, I made sure during editing that all roles get directly assigned to the right ones for audio and video alike, also all non-English dialogue (we had German and Kurdish besides the English narration) was translated on-the-go and out into a corresponding SRT captions track. From this point on, whatever I was doing and moving around would clearly be color-coded and ready to be filtered by the timeline index. Grading was done exclusively with the new native ‘Color Adjustment’ correction (plus some shape masks) which allow for easy highlight recovery. For sharpening I used the ‘High-pass Filter’ ported from Apple’s Motion (see bottom for details).","Video clean-feed with titles to be added in yet another project"]},{"l":"Versioning","p":["Checking the list from the beginning again, there are some special requirements for non-cinema releases. Namely R128 (audio) and R103 (video) normalizations. The latter we took care of with the ‘Broadcast Safe’ filter directly in FCP but sadly, Apple has not included audio mastering yet. Again, this task is covered by Davinci Resolve (this time ‘lite’ suffices) where you can normalize audio according to the most important standards via a right click on it in a timeline. So we have to re-import a final mix in R128 once again and put in our project. This is represented in Screenshot 4.","Cinema international version in 2K flat 1998x1080, 24p, 5.1 Surround as ProRes HQ master file with English titles and burnt-in English subtitles (captions).","For audio, I drop in the previously exported Stereo mixes (R128 and M&E) and manually speed-change them (FCP does not do this automatically for audio, which is a good thing!) by 4,1% (remember, the original FPS was 23,98 not native 24p, hence 0,1% more – yes, I know everything is super confusing). Audio should not be in complete sync and at the exact same length as video.","HDTV/VOD version in HD 16:9 (just change project settings for a different resolution), 24p with either Surround or Stereo + M&E as ProRes HQ, with or without titles and captions as separate files (note that there is also a CC track, meaning closed captions, aka SDH, in which also spoken English has been transcribed).","I can now deliver the following as listed in the very beginning:","Let’s not forget to, again, add the Broadcast Safe to the clean-feed to make it ‘legal’. We already know hot to proceed with exporting Multitrack QuickTime files. We are done and have exported several versions which usually takes a lot longer and additional people.","Note: You can either import CSV data into an Excel table (Google knows how to do it) or get the free ‘Table Tool’ on the Appstore to open CSV files easily.","Now comes the last, most tedious, step, which you might not need: The frame rate conversion to 25p for ex-PAL TV stations (in HD 16:9 and Stereo R128). Yet another project created, making sure it is set to 25p. Dropping in the clean-feed in 24p and FCP works its magic. It has already been conformed and speed-changed by 4% and is reduced in length because of it. I exported the Titles role as a separate video (from the 24p project) before in ProRes 4444, which includes an Alpha channel, meaning: Transparency. Why? Because now also the titles get speed-changed and are in sync without me adjusting every single title manually. I can still export another clean-feed, this time in 25p, this way. This is represented by the purple role in Screenshot 7.","Now use Save Timeline Index to CSV to receive a CSV file which you can use to create a MCS (music cue sheet) for royalty reports.","Remember the captions? The only thing not speed-changeable (why not, I ask, would be a neat feature) are the subtitles, so before we can import them here, we need them to be conformed to 25p too. Luckily there is a great free online tool for this purpose as shown in Screenshots 8a-b: https://editingtools.io/subtitles/(expand the ‘advanced’ options).","Screenshot 5A","Screenshot 5A: Using the unique Multitrack option during sharing again, it is easy to deliver a ProRes master file with 12 audio tracks, where tracks 1-6 are the full surround mix in R128 for example (assigned to ‘Dialogue’ role but you could create your own) and tracks 7-12 are surround M&E, meaning everything without speech for dubbing purposes and in full scale (not R128). Also, through removing or adding the ‘Titles’ role it is easy to create a clean-feed or localized English version. Again, cations are exported separately as sidecar SRT files, as shown at the bottom.","Screenshot 5B","Screenshot 5B: Same thing as 5a but now it is a project set to stereo with the corresponding mixes we created before hand from the original project and/or stems.","Screenshot 6A","Screenshot 6B","Screenshot 7","Screenshot 7: The clean-feed 24p assets (audio and video) in yet a new project, which is set to HD 25p for broadcast PAL conforming. Note: This requires a speed change of 4,1% and will make the film shorter (or longer if you go the other way). FCP takes care of most of the process automatically. If you have separate sound (and did not include it in the clean video), you need to change its speed manually: Right click, change duration, use 104,1% for 24p -> 25p.","Screenshot 8A","Screenshot 8B","Screenshots 6A-B: Using the Timeline Index to get a list of music and titles cues as CSV via CommandPost. As you can see, the duration is missing, which would be helpful if requested.","Screenshots 8A-B: This way I can speed change (adjust timings) all SRTs too for re-import.","The actual DCP encoding (which in itself is its own workflow and mastering step) will be done by me as well but using Davinci Resolve Studio (!) which includes Kakadu J2K cinema packaging. The world-wide digital cinema standard is still (and only) DCP IOP and requires you to jump through a few hoops to really guarantee a reliable projection quality and playability. By the way: I offer the only (free) eBook and paid video course for in-depth professional DCP mastering in Davinci Resolve Studio on my website.","The same you can do for titles to receive a CSV for the titles inserts list as demonstrated in Screenshot 6b. It really helps, however a possible improvement would be to have the CSV also include the duration of the clips, not only their starting position.","This is where our beloved CommandPost comes to help. It can save the contents of the Timeline Index, which you should learn to love. It is your best friend, as is CommandPost: In the Timeline Index, select ‘Clips’ at the top and ‘Audio’ at the bottom to get a list of just the audio files at their corresponding position (and with their corresponding role), as demonstrated in Screenshot 6a. Of course, we are only interested in the role ‘Music’.","TV and big VOD platforms also need some documentation and special reports to go with your delivered assets. Usually a music cue sheet (MCS), a titles inserts list (TIL) and a full script of every spoken word for dubbing or localization (captioning). The latter we already have (kind of) with the above mentioned CC (SDH) SRT file – which I created by running a separated narration VO file (exported this one role) through the genius ‘MacWhisper’ app and combined the resulting SRT with the other one within the FCP captions. For the other two report docs we need all the timings (timecode) of both, text inserts and music cues.","UPDATE (1st Dec 2023): Seems like there is an easier and a lot more straightforward solution for cue sheets (music and titles) by using the fantastic companion app Producer’s Best Friend by Intelligent Assistance.

As David told me, the whole thing emerged from a circle of friends. And at the same time it's the cinema debut for many of the team. How did the beginnings of the script come about?","DANIEL: Well, I've known David much longer than Denis (Denis Moschitto, co-director and main cast). We shot the series \"Im Knast\" in 2015/16 and became close friends after the first season. I was ready to make my film debut. Denis wanted to work as a full-blown filmmaker and not \"only\" as an actor. And we figured we want to do this with David, not only as the guy who cuts everything together in the end. So we formed a gang of three - also as proof of concept of how we want to work. It wasn't like, \"Oh, we want to tell this practitioner's story.\" It was more about: how do we actually want to shoot (and produce a film) at all? We took a much more radical approach. The film had an internal working title. We called it: \"Let's fuck shit up!\". So, this freedom was really important to us from the get-go, not for reasons of protectionism, but to not be held back by some kind of structural corset. For example, we didn’t want to work closely with a post-house, rather we wanted to be in control of it ourselves; we wanted to do the exports without calling a technician or anxiously send out VFX lists only to have someone tell us it’s too expensive. We wanted to do it on our terms and with our particular skill-set. And that was at least as important as the story: to figure out our own process, like a personal framework for filmmaking. Is it possible to do it that way? And if so, then we'll cultivate that in the future.","FLORIAN: So you imagined an even more intense collaborative process as filmmaking already is? And you started with the key-positions of editing, acting and directing?","DANIEL: Yes, you could say that. You also have to say that Denis didn't want to play the lead role at first. He wanted to do the part behind the camera. But that ultimately changed during Covid19, I have to be honest.","DAVID: The pandemic changed the script as well.","DANIEL: Yeah, exactly, that opened a door.","DAVID: It inspired parts of the story that weren't there before. Probably the strongest storylines now.","FLORIAN: So I understand it like this: everyone brings their particular skills from a different direction and then you mingle together. And Denis brought his skills from the acting-side?","“ Some even say the Film Editor is like a second director. Denis recently called it shadow-directing. ”","DANIEL: Yes, basically that's right. And if I may say one more thing, which is really close to my heart; a really underestimated part of your (David and Florian’s) work is: Editing isn’t only connecting lines and securing continuity! If you do a somewhat decent job, you finish writing the script in the edit! And I think it's totally important not just to award credits, but, prospectively, understand it as the collective effort it already is. Some even say the Film Editor is like a second director. Denis recently called it shadow-directing. It's sometimes very difficult to distinguish: what is script, what is acting, what is camera, what is staging? And with editing, somehow nobody sees it unless it sucks. Or you win an Oscar, like in this Queen film, because you clearly saw how strong the interventions are there. Unfortunately, there's no real obvious traction for this, neither inside nor outside our line of work, that articulates how much these processes are interdependent and extremely interdisciplinary. And I also think that a lot of the work of directing on set is about opening up spaces for people to do their work well. That's always been a saying that we've had: you don't tell actors how to play it well, but you find people, through casting and all other processes, who work it out with you. And for us, Editing is simply part of that from the very beginning. That's the way it is for me from now on. With every larger project, it's simply an absolute must-have that the editing is there as early as it can be. That you simply talk about everything. So David was even present during prep for blocking the scenes. That all paid off. That's not the most efficient way of working as far as human life is concerned. Nevertheless, for me it’s the nucleus of an ideal shooting situation. To manage this in 30 shooting days, which have come to destroy you. (smiles) To pull that off, that’s killer!","FLORIAN: David, did you actually co-write or just read the script and comment on it?","DAVID: The latter. I’ve never had the script open in Final Draft in this case, but I had read everything since the first treatment draft and we talked about it afterwards. What works well, where do I have ideas for development? It was such a gritty learning process. I would also say that my initial comments were more like, \"yeah, it's all totally awesome, looks awesome, great, exactly.\" The closer the shoot, the more complex the exchange became. And I think that in follow-up projects we’re already noticing how this collaboration has changed and intensified.","FLORIAN: So, you're actually benefiting from this intense work during writing and pre-production. Are you actually getting faster? More precise?","DAVID: Several things. We knew the story and the characters so well that there were few questions left. We developed a lot, of course we'll get to that in a minute when we talk about principal shooting. But I think it's more that through this experience the degree to which I get involved in new projects is now much more intense. By how we've learned to communicate with each other about film, what we like, what works well, what direction we want to go. And also that we can imagine writing a script together. I mean, I would still have to prove that I can do that. But in the process of this film, we came so far that I don't think it would be an absurdity for all of us if that happens."]},{"l":"Workflow","p":["“ My motivation to work like this also came from my buddy Frido, who always used to select in Final Cut with the Playstation controller. He used to sit on the couch, in front of his client monitor, he does a lot of advertising and has a really fat client monitor, so he used to sit on the client couch and did selects with the controller. ”","DANIEL: And Reject, maybe, too.","DANIEL: Yeah, exactly, so since that (FCPX 2012) came out, I've cut everything I could with it. Obviously I haven't edited a feature film, but I've gained a lot of experience in terms of workflow stuff. And I've done a lot with it. And I loved it very quickly. The first version was really bad... but after they changed the library structure, it worked. Also, for David and me, a very important point was that we both had no desire to work on Avid and also had our experiences with Premiere. With Final Cut, you can just dig in and just work sensibly - cut \"from the gut\". And that's what I personally really wanted to do, because I know: You wipe over the footage, make a range, throw everything you find interesting in the timeline - snip, snap, snip - drag scenes to the left, to the right, to the left, to the right and then you're done....","DANIEL: You did, once.","DAVID: And Forward, Backward.","DAVID: And marked In/Out, favorite with the Playstation controller.","DAVID: And Reject still, yeah. And so then I watched and selected. Started editing in parallel as well, but it's a much more fluid and cohesive process.","DAVID: As I said, we wanted to do as much as possible ourselves. But of course, in order to have a certain security, just for insurance and stuff like that, there was still a post-production house involved. And that was WeFadeToGrey. The proxies were created there, then the proxies went to Victor (Rosario, Assistant Editor), and he synced everything. Then I took a walk to Victor's place, because it was very close, and picked up the footage on a hard drive, super oldschool, and if he was already done, also the Final Cut Library, or he sent it to me later.","DAVID: Exactly, yeah.","DAVID: I also created keywords for a few dialogs. But I discarded that relatively quickly, because there's just not that much talking in our film. (Laughter)","DAVID: Nah, actually it always stayed that way. And I didn't split the timeline into reels either, I just started and kind of kept going and when Final Cut slowed down I just reduced the library (deleted older timelines) and then everything rolled again smoothly. That way I didn't have the need to structure it differently. Admittedly, our workflow was really very low-tech in that respect. And, what we haven't said yet is that I hadn't worked on Final Cut once before.","DAVID: No, I had one event per shooting day and then sorted the scenes by keywords.","DAVID: Totally. Although our workflow and also the structure of the library was not ideal. But the pure editing, that went super fast, well off the cuff. Basically, I've never understood it if you only want to work with one technique or one software. Because first of all you’d limit yourself. And I think they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Final Cut is simply years ahead! But still, both Avid and Premiere have their justification. At btf, we worked on Premiere for all those years and it was perfect for one-shots that had a lot of graphics and VFX shots. It would have been unthinkable to work on Avid. And that was kind of the approach to learn the \"new hot shit\" as well. Of course, that started with the viewing and selecting, how much fun that is! Because otherwise, in Premiere or in Avid, with every new project, I'm actually always faced with such a conundrum first, that I have to decide how I want to watch and select now.","DAVID: Unlike with Avid or Premiere, I don't have to decide: do I just watch everything first? Do I do markers or a select sequence or do I start cutting directly and slowly work my way through the footage? When I'm working on Avid or Premiere, I usually do it in such a way that I start cutting right away and then go from the footage further into the structure, into the deep. With the way you can mark favorites in Final Cut, I've gone back to doing selects classically without feeling like it's costing me too much time, energy, and motivation. I feel like selecting with other NLEs, maybe that's fun, too. But when you're done you haven't done anything yet. (Laughter) You don't have that feeling with Final Cut. So: I marked my favorites, and then in the next step, in the View I already hid everything (note: show only Favorites in Browser) and with that I had my select reel in the Browser as a starting point. My motivation to work like this also came from my buddy Frido, who always used to select in Final Cut with the Playstation controller. He used to sit on the couch, in front of his client monitor, he does a lot of advertising and has a really fat client monitor, so he used to sit on the client couch and did selects with the controller.","DAVID: Well, I once assisted a friend (Frido Körner) on a commercial, with the approach \"I want to learn a little Final Cut\". I did rough cuts there, too, and mainly got the assistant stuff down, to understand how Final Cut works in the structure. Then I looked at your (Florian, German editor’s association internal) introduction again, in preparation for the film and then just jumped in at the deep end and started. Because Daniel knows Final Cut so well, I had no worries for the time after the shooting. And during shooting I could always call Frido if I had any questions...","DAVID: Well, once, I did once....","DAVID: Yes, from Stella Fachinger. I was also on the set for the first two days of shooting, and then we talked on the phone, and in the classic way there were Lockit files digital ScriptSuper-notes that Victor transferred into FCP).","Editing a feature film with Final Cut Pro","Event structure of the editing project","FLORIAN: And have there been notes from the ScriptSupervisor?","FLORIAN: And then there was one event per scene? Or did you do it via keywords?","FLORIAN: And with this Favorites-concept you went through the whole film? So it's not like you did extra keywords again? That would be my method: the favorites all get one keyword, then the favorites get suspended and I select favorites of that keyword (fine selection).","FLORIAN: He put the shortcuts on the controller?","FLORIAN: Okay, do you mind telling us briefly what the technical workflow was like, from the set to the editing room. And after that, we would look a little bit at how you actually worked dramaturgically on set. How were the proxies delivered to you and how were they created?","FLORIAN: Okay, let's start there. You get the first shooting day in for SCHOCK, and then: how do you select?","FLORIAN: Okay. And David, did it feel for you like that right away? All this throwing in and freestyle mixing clips, as Daniel describes the whole thing?","FLORIAN: Okay. Then you split it into reels yourself at some point, or scene-Events?","FLORIAN: Play, Pause, In/Out, Favorite, that's all you need.","FLORIAN: So it’s been ProRes proxies?","FLORIAN: Wait a minute, Daniel, but you've done a lot before, smaller projects?","FLORIAN: Wait, this is where it gets interesting.","FLORIAN: What do you mean not once?","FLORIAN: Yeah, exactly. We haven't even mentioned that yet. I'll add that later in the short summary.","FLORIAN: Yes."]},{"l":"Watching Dailies","p":["Shooting day briefing “New School”","FLORIAN: And then let's say now, you're done with the shooting day and then came the special thing, which maybe was still common in the past, that you did something similar to watching dailies with the head-of’s. Now that went a bit differently with you guys. That's of course totally interesting, how this process was at the end of the shooting day between the two of you. Or three of you, together with Denis?","DAVID: Exactly, and sometimes even four, with DoP Paul Pieck together. We already met with the motivation, relatively classical, to watch dailies. Then, when you're sitting in a café where it's a little bit louder, that's not such a good idea anymore. And relatively quickly we moved on to not discussing the previous day's dailies, but rather doing a kind of style critique. On the one hand, how the camera works and how we want to narrate cinematically with the camera, and on the other hand about the character development.","DANIEL: We did make some drastic decisions, it has to be said. For example, we changed the character who gets shot at the end in the showdown. That was originally a different person. And that evolved exactly from those conversations. David was telling Paul all the time, \"Dude, fuck the axis, go in, shoot sloppy, it doesn't matter, let go!\" And that totally triggered a lot. You really can't underestimate that. It was incredibly important. Yesterday, in a moment of madness, I looked at the version we shot - not one stone was left unturned, except for very important details. The film changed incredibly during principal filming. And that was totally cool, I would say. To always discuss with each other and to hold each other up. It was a constant comparison: here we are on the right track, there we have to put in more, there we give less. It's also a film that intentionally leaves out information in a lot of places, in a way that hopefully doesn't bother you. Without those conversations, we never would have been able to do it that way.","DAVID: Frustration management, too. The shoot was tough as nails. There were really few shooting days for what we had planned. And of course the guys were used up quickly. And I gave a lot of motivational speeches. Not because it didn't work. It was often about saying: we're on a good path!","DANIEL: Yes. With David, at the end of the day, it was another view from the outside. While I was already essentially the first viewer via the small monitor on set, David was the next first viewer.","FLORIAN: Yeah, logical. I can also feed back to you that, my impression after the premiere. Because I knew that David was there, I also tried to notice the editing and the mise-en-scene. In other words, I tried to watch actively, what I usually avoid at the first screening. And it's striking: the film is extremely varied! Longer camera movements, pans, montage-sequences, but also more classic blocking and also somewhat fancy camera angles. And still, the thing seems to be made of one piece. It just doesn't fall apart, but it makes the whole thing lively and exciting. And maybe that's also due to this process.","DANIEL: For sure.","DAVID: We didn't just talk about the footage, but also about the next day and what’s planned. And that's where we sometimes developed together, we said \"come on, this scene: one shot!\", or \"come on: two safety, but no shot-reverse-shot!\", just brave: something interlaced, or maybe a bit architectural... And these are then ultimately also the scenes where the shots could last very long (without a cut)."]},{"l":"Redefining the Genre","p":["Without negating the legacy","FLORIAN: The film manages to stay tough and serious. How hard was it for you not to drift into satire or coolness? And that maybe ties into what you guys were just talking about.","DANIEL: So it's a mixture of very easy and very, very, very difficult. When we decided to make a movie at that time, the idea came up, \"what about a gangster movie?\". And then we actually said, \"no, this coolness, somehow we're not up for it at all\". And that was, I think, a narrative demand that had been seething with us for so long that we couldn't get past it. We wanted to play with it. For example, Fahri (Yardim, supporting cast) is wearing a cool leather jacket and is looking grim, but in such a way that it doesn't tip over into a comic reality. That was actually a very simple decision. A film that nevertheless serves the genre, with a showdown, with a certain form of depiction of violence. That it has to be a bit borderline. Not a film that has to please everyone. It was ultimately about going a little bit to the extreme. For example: How little can you talk without thinking it’s a student film where the task was: you're not allowed to talk. So, getting the coolness out of it wasn't that hard. But a film that builds a coherent atmosphere and world within these 114 minutes, without classically learned mechanics, without a love interest, with a main character for whom you can't clearly say why he's actually acting like this. That was very, very difficult. And it took a lot of time.","“ How little can you talk without thinking it’s a student film where the task was: you're not allowed to talk. ”","FLORIAN: Cool gangster movies - there would be a lot of references. So there are pitfalls when you're staging it the opposite way and dealing with actors who are used to it differently. There's a lot for you to do on set, isn't there? Always holding them back a little bit or nudging it in a different direction.","DANIEL: Yeah, ..., we still have a few ADR parts in it that are a thorn in our side. That's why I watched the raw footage of a scene again. And I was totally surprised. It's the scene where Bruno is at Giuli's house for the first time and treats this wound. The scene is just forever long. The footage is forever. And Denis is acting with this medicine bag that was completely filled, like, 300 times in the movie. Incredibly hard to act shit. It's an awkward prop. Incredible number of times he has to open it, close it.","DAVID: Gloves always on, mask too.","DANIEL: The handling, the continuity - that wasn't the difficulty. It was the ability to remain calm. Not to go for efficiency in storytelling. Not to tell it like: now he's sitting with his sister, then he has to say \"sis\" three more times so that people understand.","DAVID: For the scene, we had a relatively steep idea for the character constellation in the days before (during the dailies-discussions). There's not much of that left in the result, but it led to quite a lot of nuances.","DANIEL: There used to be a different ending, it has to be said.","FLORIAN: They're hugging, aren't they?","DAVID: Exactly.","DANIEL: Actually, something else happened after the hug.","DAVID: Right. And also in between, some other stuff happened where the relationship between brother and sister gets a different conflict that we ended up leaving out, but it totally helped the buildup of the scene. Because a conflict arose between the three of them. That was then left out. But it still remained as a basic conflict in the constellation of the characters. And this development was totally exciting for us. A bit like a director's trick, but without being shitty to people, so that they reach their limits. Like throwing in an idea to push everyone to the brink. Coming back to the genre arc, what was really important for the shoot as well: to actually show a lot of things and to be explicit. Not to cut away in moments where it's about violence, or even the consequences of violence, or everything that's medical in the film. We wanted to be in these moments and absolutely show it. For example the treatment of the gunshot wound. How he pulls the thing off and you see the \"pizza\" (inflammation around the wound) and the hole. We have been so lucky with our make-up artists, Daniel Schröder and Annette Schirmer. It had to look good. He takes off the patch and you think \"oh shit, this fucking hole in the back\". Starting from there to the thumb at the end (of the film), we wanted to show everything. Not to cut away in those moments and only tell it with sound because it's easier. Sound also works, because it hurts associatively. But we wanted to show it all, as statements of intent to the genre.","DANIEL: Immanence, that was a total buzzword for us when we were shooting. We tried to hold it up everywhere we could. For the genre. To somehow get pressure into it. Meaning: real shots, real locations, no car rides in LED hell. And above all, to let actors play and not only shoot for the edit."]},{"i":"creative-struggles--frustration-management","l":"Creative Struggles & Frustration Management","p":["_“ Final Cut invites you to go on forever: fade here, something there, jab jab, while it is running (!), ... ”","DANIEL: Exactly, the letting go, even of frustrations from the set. We had that with two or three other scenes that took a little bit in the edit to get done. At some point, one of us said, \"Nah, come on, let's do it. We'll take out the montage-sequence and we'll go through it properly, again.\" I mean, you know for yourself when you're sitting in the edit and suddenly the knot unravels. And you know you’ll just need three frames here, a different setting there, and maybe a little bit of a different mindset ... We also had a small, very early test screening with Rainer Nigrelli and Flo Böttger. Watching it with different eyes has also totally changed a lot for us. And for David it was just stress, because there are two guys sitting behind him and say, \"Get in early.\" - \"No, out earlier.\" - \"Boom, there's music.\" - \"Nah, without music.\". That was really super untechnical. That's why, I think, we haven’t had real conflict, except for general frustration management. But there was a long phase, also during editing, where we had no idea whether the film would work. I think we were really afraid that we would cut it and then it would just completely suck.","DANIEL: I got two, three things. David?","DANIEL: I think 30 days in total. I remembered 18 weeks of editing.","DANIEL: That was surprising. That was really surprising.","DANIEL: Totally. It's totally crucial. I've also suffered a lot in Premiere and Avid. More in Premiere, even less in Avid. I really think: getting access to the footage, so you just have a visual reference of what you're working on, that's easy in Final Cut - I can’t understand why you wouldn't want that in editing. I really don’t fathom.","DANIEL: Vape, vape, vape ... I picked up the mouse every once in a while. I really like seeing the timeline to get a feel for what's happening. And what I find so nice about Final Cut is that you can just let it run, trim another clip while it's running, turn the music down a bit, you can just march through. Even Denis felt the vibe that you can just march and “massage” the footage as you like. We actually took moments now and then to get away from the computer and watch it on a TV-Set. Because Final Cut invites you to go on forever: fade here, something there, jab jab, while it is running (!), and so constantly the attention is gone. But I don't think I'm a better editor than David, on the contrary. I'm just a bit more into technical shit, whereas David is more into \"I'll edit the scene nice and tidy\". If there's a new Voice Isolation thing in there, I immediately want to know how it works. Where the limits of it are and where they aren't. David just doesn't give a shit. So I was doing more of an editing assist, if you will.","DANIEL: We thought that was going to happen, but it didn't.","DANIEL: Yes, it could be that I did that once. It wasn’t the usual \"there's a director sitting around\". We always sat behind David, jerking around like dudes, which had to be annoying sometimes, right?","DAVID: 18 weeks of editing, but that was including principal shooting. We were together the whole time. And just fought our way through. It was an incredibly intense process. But at the same time, you have to say, we had no single night shift. Not on any day.","DAVID: 18 weeks was all right. We always said to ourselves, if it takes longer: screw it. We had an extremely low budget and we made super little money on the film. But because it was all of our big screen debut, we didn't give a shit.","DAVID: Exactly, and there again, this whole process is totally awesome that we wrestled for this scene so much and it changed for the better.","DAVID: Exactly, we thought it was going to happen. Sometimes I like that, too, as a certain protection mechanism. If I don't happen to know the director or producer that well yet, then maybe I’d like to have time alone to try something out and not have someone sitting behind me. With Daniel and Denis, there were no such insecurities or fears, for sure. But of course, when you're three guys... How many weeks did you shoot, Daniel?","DAVID: For example, we cut out the death of the character Naimee, the prostitute, very early. And built it so that that strand basically ends loosely for Bruno. After she’s got the sepsis and then an allergic reaction, it just got better again and he doesn't hear anything of her anymore. Particularly Denis and I favored that for a very long time. In the end, it's always a bit theoretical. You kind of have an idea to tell it differently and think: that's okay, it didn’t have as much impact as we thought it might anyways. Naturally, that's the easy way to get rid of it. And that's where Daniel really pissed us off, in a positive sense. He \"beat us up\" to not leave it like that and to give up. And I also think my ethos developed a lot during that time. As an editor, you probably don't want to admit that, but of course sometimes the path of least resistance is a grateful one.","DAVID: Nah, I don't think so. I think during that time there was an update with Dupe Detection. That was great. Because that was totally missing. Then all of a sudden it was there. And it was like \"Thank you!\".","DAVID: Right, and I'm not very interested in that.","DAVID: That was very surprising. Because Daniel and I are geared to spend the whole night. Maybe we were there until 10 p.m., but then the last two hours were mostly talking.","DAVID: Vaping noises, behind me all day.","DAVID: We had a rough cut of, I think, 2:45 hours. The first days were a bit wild … aftermath of the wrapping party. And then we really just sat together every day. So I don't remember any situation where we discussed something, now they're going to leave, we'll talk more tomorrow and I’ll execute.","DAVID: Yes, and I think with me it derives from \"learned stress\" from other projects. I had to unlearn that, in a way. We're editing together again at the moment. Daniel can say \"yes, let's have another look\", as often as he likes - I'm rarely annoyed. Except maybe when I'm tired, the dog is barking and I'm hungry and I think to myself, \"now leave me alone!\" The three of us have had a lot of things to deal with, I guess. Even Denis, who has never sat in the edit so intensely. I mean, with three people, if there's a disagreement, then it's two against one. There's no other way. And of course you’ll get annoyed sometimes. But in the end we all mastered these challenges, even if it took a little while. Denis is also happy now that Naimee's death is still in there. And I also like the way we approached the scene in the edit and with elliptical storytelling. How Bruno sits there and is desperate about what happened. That's how it became a strong scene. Not an action sequence of \"will he manage to save her?\". He arrives, she's already dead, and through our editing his desperation becomes very clear and relatable.","FLORIAN: And the Voice Isolation came with the same update, I think.","FLORIAN: Bitter reality.","FLORIAN: Daniel, can I just ask, with your Final Cut background, were there moments where you said, “let me do it myself”? Did you also sometimes, maybe for the better, push the keyboard over to each other?","FLORIAN: I think it’s great.","FLORIAN: My experience is almost the other way around, that I always say, \"I know you don't like it, but I'll remind you in two days, that maybe we should cut it out.\" Here the director is fighting obtrusively for something? But I guess it makes sense in your collective construct?","FLORIAN: The filmstrip view and how visually Final Cut presents everything, even to a bystander, is helpful to your work.","FLORIAN: We agree on that. Were there certain challenges in this fine-cutting phase, where you struggled and fought or where it just took longer and you were able to solve them?","FLORIAN: Yeah, cool. Let's go into your fine editing phase then. David, you had Denis and Daniel sitting there all the time - or did you send them out of the studio sometimes?","FLORIAN: Yeah, that’s in every process, usually after three weeks of fine editing or so. I would now slowly shift towards post and then wrap the whole thing. Maybe a little question about Final Cut: Did you miss something essential in the whole process? Or where you guys said, \"Gee, that feature would actually be good.\"","FLORIAN: You haven’t been so limited in time. For a TV movie you have to be done after 10 weeks.","Picture Lock Timeline with Playouts and Burnins above"]},{"l":"Post Production","p":["Delivering with Final Cut Pro","DANIEL: Yeah, it's awesome. I think during the edit itself - no complaints. Since I also did VFX, I took over the project technically after editing. And there are a few things during the handovers. For example, I would like to be able to lock the cut. That you can kind of say, Primary Storyline: no more timing change. That would be nice, for example. And sometimes it's a bit annoying that metadata in the Event and Timeline don't stay in sync. For example, if you create a Role for a VFX-source, that is not reflected in the Event, e. g. as a keyword-range. The information is only in the timeline. We had VFX shots marked with their own Roles to get them out as sources for VFX. I just did the math again. 71 fullblown VFX shots, but in reality it was more like 90. And that's not counting stabilizations. Because I did it all myself it was quite a lot of stuff. Then, of course, like I think a lot of people, we also had problems with stabilization, one should just be able to rebuild them 1-1 on other workstations, I think. And timecode... Or is that solved now? There is this timecode window. Is it possible to display the different tracks? I still don't think so.","FLORIAN: Well, you can display it, but you can't burn it in.","DANIEL: Exactly. That's also really annoying, for example, that you can't do proper burn-ins. That would be really nice for a professional workflow, when you send it out to sound-post. So I brought the stuff into Resolve and made burn-ins there, then brought it back into Final Cut. It always takes time.","FLORIAN: Well, there are workarounds inside FCP for these problems, but it could be better. And what was the point with stabilizing? So it wasn't the same on one computer as it was on the other?","DANIEL: No, that worked. But at some point it was like, you do a stabilization and everything is good. If you open it up on another computer, the analyzing never stops (note.: is constantly re-rendering). And the still frame is different from the moving picture. Feels a little wonky, I'd say.","FLORIAN: It would actually need some kind of render lock for one clip. That's what Alex4D once suggested.","“ I also think that you can't design sound as beautifully in almost any other tool as you can in Final Cut. It's an incredibly cool sound tool! ”","DANIEL: Exactly. At least some kind of rebuild function for the internal effects, which are otherwise great. And of course a render lock would be great as well. I think those are the few things I can think of right now. I also think audio lanes are great. I'm very happy about that. I also think that you can't design sound as beautifully in almost any other tool as you can in Final Cut. It's an incredibly cool sound tool! And that's super important to all of us. We worked on sound a lot and very precisely. So it's a shame - but this is a ProTools issue - when you put so much work into details that then all goes down the drain in transfers. I think that's really sad. If I still had time to learn programming somehow, I would do everything I could to get the sound in the studio to be exactly the same as it is in the edit. And also this \"In Avid, a lot of people only edit with mix-tracks\"-paradigm, that you don't really care about the sound in the edit, that bothers me.","FLORIAN: So, when you think about the deliveries now, David, you just handed it over to Daniel? And although you onlined it at WeFadeToGrey you still did the VFX and even the grading?","DANIEL: Exactly.","FLORIAN: But in Resolve probably.","Audio Lanes View of final edit"]},{"i":"pre-gradinghome-office","l":"pre-grading@home-office","p":["DANIEL: Exactly. The film got proper grading after all. And of course, that's only possible because I did a relatively intensive pre-grading. I built myself a nice little grading box in the office with black styros. With my Mac Studio and a 4K-DCI Eizo monitor, which I calibrated to 709. Then in Resolve I worked in full resolution in DaVinci wide gamut/intermediate, which is the RCM-2 color space, a color managed workflow. So I prepared grading on my 709 monitor and cut in all the VFX, then I could just switch to P3D65 to prepare it for the grading cinema. So that process worked extremely well if you ask me.","FLORIAN: Kind of like ACES, right?","DANIEL: So when ACES came out, I was always working in ACES. And when RCM-2 was released from Blackmagic, and the new HDR grading tools ... that is, I think, from the usability so fine, so nice to work with, I find ACES in comparison a bit ... sharper, feels more brutal somehow. I think (as a director) it makes much more sense to colorize your own film than to edit it. You can quickly change things radically. And develop a taste and build and try things out. Long story short, it's been a bit low-tech of course that I did it here in my office but then we moved to WeFadeToGrey and had the total opposite there in the grading cinema. That's kind of where the magic is for me. And what we haven't even said yet: We shot with the Sony Venice on full frame Cooke lenses, all 3:2 open gate in RAW (X-OC-XT), so 2:1 anamorphic 6K. Which is a quasi-12K image (de-stretched) or 12096x4032. But the finish was in 4K. WeFadeToGrey helped us a lot, especially Swen Linde supported us very well. We can only be very grateful. I don't think you could have done much more deluxe in Cologne. They were major supporters of us.","DAVID: Exactly, even though we wanted to do a lot ourselves, they really helped us out a lot.","FLORIAN: And this high resolution, of course it helps with VFX, as well as in editing, when you want to zoom a little further into the frame. I assume that you also used that more often.","DAVID: Yes.","DANIEL: Yes"]},{"i":"director--vfx-artist","l":"Director = VFX-artist?","p":["FLORIAN: Okay. I think now we should, but I'm still interested in the VFX workflow, briefly. So did you do those in Resolve or did you send them back to Final Cut?","DANIEL: Well, I did the onlining in Resolve. You have to know, during film school, I already had gathered experience in title design, grading and VFX-stuff for family and friends. My secret, technical post-production life, so to say. (smiles) So I did the VFX partly in After Effects, partly in Fusion. We don't have any 3D composites in it. But I always sent everything back into Final Cut easily via fcpxml, so that we could make clean playouts and sound transfers \"offline\" with the 2K proxies. We also re-delivered if anything was needed, or looked for another take. The Final Cut project was still in use during that process.","FLORIAN: Okay, okay, okay.","DAVID: Maybe a mini remark about the VFX. We just really had an endless number of retouches.","FLORIAN: Removals, retouches, split screens.","DAVID: Split screens and also really complex split screens, sometimes with two or three other retouching layers.","FLORIAN: Especially because of the handheld camera every single plate has to be tracked before comping, probably a bit tricky.","DAVID: Exactly, and therefore mostly zoomed in a bit. So it's not an uncomplex thing that Daniel did there. Which was just cool, briefly back to the editing process, because we were just never in the situation of having to think about whether it can be paid. We just did what we wanted to do in the end. Denis and I rather tried to hold Daniel back and say, hey, can't we not kill this VFX-shot, because you know what else you have to do.","FLORIAN: Daniel, how long did it take?","DANIEL: Yeah, a long time. I think three, four weeks at least. It was really crazy. But it was also cool. It was glamorous. Almost all the tracking stuff I did with Mocha because I did a lot of rotoscoping stuff with it as well and I just really like using Mocha. Also the performance with these 6K, de-stretched, was relatively good. I mean, I don't even want to pretend it had good performance when it comes to that kind of footage. It was overwhelming. A violent footage tornado that ran through my equipment. I worked with Mocha Pro. It was super awesome, I have to say. But then I had some problems with Mocha. There's a relatively new surface tracker in the Pro version that you can use to track organic stuff. It always crashed. And then I wrote back and forth with Boris FX support several times a day for a week, I think. It was a very intensive exchange. And that was really cool, how they took care of it. I thought that was totally great.","FLORIAN: Because it was so fresh on the M1, probably."]},{"l":"Working with Independent Developers","p":["“ Technically, I found that going through this process with Final Cut was incredibly convenient. Even the re-delivery process was very relaxed. If you document it thoughtfully! And if there's one tool that invites you to do that, it's Final Cut. ”","bluesky","DANIEL: I have one last thing. And I'll make this real quick. What was so cool for us was when our producers and everybody said we're going to go back into the mix and we're going to re-cut. That everyone worked together like that. With EDLX, I pushed out EDLs for reconforming and created changelists with \"Change List X\". With reference audio because we cut with stems and only brought in original audio where there were changes. I provided the Soundpost with a small flood of deliveries and that worked super well. So don't be afraid to change things afterwards. It's not like we changed every other frame now, it was much more selective. We added one more scene, took one out, changed a few timings and tried to relax so that we didn't have to go into the whole process again. In the process, two or three VFX shots were created and I did the conforming in Resolve, I bounced the transfers back to our audio post, which worked really well. And I have to say, a little bit of “new school filmmaking” is that you don't let technical shit like that stop you. That just because you have a Picture-Lock planned, you're not going to change anything anymore. It's important, of course, that you do it reasonably and don't, like a maniac, say, “I'm not going to stop editing the film”. Technically, I found that going through this process with Final Cut was incredibly convenient. Even the re-delivery process was very relaxed. If you document it thoughtfully! And if there's one tool that invites you to do that, it's Final Cut. You get lists beaten out of there, technical solutions via Resolve and other tools... you can do things that are otherwise very difficult.","DANIEL: I think they were a bit keen on it, but they also saw, I think, that I do comparatively complex tracking stuff that you have to get to grips with somehow. But I was totally accepted by them. They sent me an alpha version early on so that I could work here. And that was just totally awesome, I thought. It was like a little nerd convention, over email and a little bit of chat, just solving problems with each other. So, you know, the nice thing was that I didn't really have a deadline. It wasn't like, fuck, now I've lost three days with some technical problem and I have to hustle through it so that I can keep to my timing. And I had a short contact with the X2Pro people, Marquis Broadcast. They also helped a lot to identify the problem in the first place. For example, we were talking about 32-bit audio. I think they've got a handle on all that in the meantime. (edit: yes. Fixed in 4.5.16) And that was just great that someone could make a reasonable statement. That you don't somehow only look for the error in yourself and don't understand why there is only noise in ProTools.","DANIEL: I worked with that as well. Yeah, that was great. So I did all the VFX lists with Producers Best Friend. Absolutely awesome. Even with thumbnails! If I had done that by hand, I would have been on it for a week.","DANIEL: Probably.

This was all tracked using a Google Sheet with the shots available to the whole team via Box.","As the edit started to come together, I’d share my thoughts with Mike and the producer who would look at WIP edits and communicate notes back to the animators based on shots that may need some minor tweaks to help the edit. It might be a frame here and there or (very occasionally) a whole rethink, but due to time restraints, we’d often have to compromise, focusing on what served the story and what was achievable in the time and with the resources we had at our disposal.","Being from a live action background, this was a different workflow for me. During pre-production, Mike would board each episode and build an animatic in Storyboard Pro which had a voice scratch track that Mike would produce himself, along with basic sound design elements and some music tracks for reference.","Below you’ll see my basic library setup for the project. The Library title was unfortunately auto generated by PostLab so the naming convention is a bit funky. A while ago, Chris Hocking who is the head of post at LateNite introduced using emojis in our Event & Folder naming structures. Although a simple thing, I’ve found this to be useful in identifying folders and events quickly and efficiently, particularly when you’re under the pump. Sometimes it’s the little things that help to keep a workflow moving.","Due to the pace in which we were working, and with multiple animators across each episode, there would occasionally be minor slip ups with the colour of a prop or a missing design element as we cut from a wide to a tight. In this instance, if we could we’d do a quick fix we would, rather than having to go back to the animator who might’ve already moved on to the next episode.","For post, we set up the project in PostLab so we could utilise the collaboration tools it offered. We encountered a few issues, with some work lost when uploading changes, however the terrible internet in Melbourne could have equally been to blame. As mentioned, the animatics for the series were produced in Storyboard Pro, from which we could export Final Cut Pro XML (.xml) files, along with any rendered visuals separated by panels. Using SendToX, I then produced a timeline with cut points along with Mike’s temp audio work. This was essentially my starting point.","Hi! I'm Kevin, the editor of The Future of Everything, a 2D animated anthology comedy series created by writer/director Mike Greaney.","If we got stuck, we’d occasionally have to pull some tricks, like repeating frames or holding frames to get the frame or two required to fix our issues.","Once I got into the edit, I would use Mike’s animatic for timing, to spot any unwanted changes that may have occurred during the migration, and to spot missing shots that may have gone unallocated or missed by the team. On episode one, I would sometimes use the .xml from the animatics to do scene detection in DaVinci Resolve, however I found that the exports from Storyboard Pro were reliable, so I abandoned this step pretty early on.","Once we had what we’ll call our first assembly edit in place with our completed shots, I’d look at the rhythm of each shot in the context of the edit, and start building a more robust sound design from the animatic.","Once we locked our edit - we’d then turn over our temp sound and music to the designer and composer respectively. On this job we were fortunate that Dead on Sound handled both. We’d export an AAF with X2Pro, with settings to discard any inactive or disabled audio. We’d also embed the audio with eight-second handles. When the mixes and stems came back as .wav files, it was just a matter of adding them as connected clips, assigning a new role, and disabling all other audio roles.","One area where live action differs from animation, is that the animatic is where you get your timing and ‘edit’ right before you start animating. Our focus during this period was sharing notes between the team on Frame.io and finessing the animatic so that by the time we entered the edit, there were really only minor tweaks required to reach our final locked off master.","That first episode was about setting up how our workflow was going to function, so there was a bit or trial and error involved, but once we found something that worked for our post team, as well as Mike and the producers, we stuck to it for the remainder of the series.","This Post-it note on top is my first prop design debut, helping to fix a continuity problem.","To finish with an interesting aside - we found that the episodes with less dialogue and narration tended to be the ones that required more tweaks, as the pacing tended to be more dictated by the animation rather than sound. Not hugely relevant to our workflow, but interesting none the less!","With the first twelve shots that I received, I exported ProRes 4444 from Adobe Animate and then imported them into keyword collections, that were organised by date, in the Animations Event I’d created. This became my process, eventually welcoming all 51 shots into my timeline for episode one.

Everybody has to leave a short note, what they were working on. At any time it's possible to go back to these instances and revisit or copy over the former edit.

But you can open a copy of the last safe at any time.","Main user interface of PostLab","All additional Media, like Music, VFX-mixdowns, SoundFX, etc., is synced via postlab.drive.

Every Editor has its own folder for additional footage","With the flexibility of PostLab - and fast SSD-RAIDs - we could easily jump between episodes. When our Assistant Raja had anything to manage, e. g. importing new scenes, it was easy as closing the project, make coffee, come back to work. Sure, with increasing complexity of the project we had longer upload-times, but we are talking maybe 4-5 minutes twice a day. Compared to how long other NLEs take to even open big projects - nothing to worry here.","Also worth noting is that the user support of the PostLab team is very fast and helpful."]},{"l":"Organisation inside FCP","p":["Every Masterclip goes into every episode.

We opted for this approach to keep the flexibility and move selected scenes to other episodes without the risk of accidentally recreating Masterclips, a feature/bug Apple yet has to tackle. With this system we were able to freely gather moments from other episodes, for example for a dream-sequence. And boy did we make use of it! Now we only needed to open a copy of another episode (PostLab) and could steal a cut from our fellow editors."]},{"l":"Masterclips","p":["The Masterclips are purposefully put into 1 Event per 5 shooting days to not overload an Event. They just have keywords for their shooting day.","Screenshot of an Event, shooting day 26 to 30 with 508 clips in it","When Final Cut loads an Event (or Compound or Timeline) and the clips inside reference to other Events, FCP hast to load these events, too. If these are very big (> 1000 Clips) FCP seems to struggle with reloading. Its one of those things that are no big deal when they occur occasionally (just wait a few seconds), but can annoy when they appear every other time you switch the Timeline. So, we break up the Masterclip-Events into chunks of 500-1000 Clips. Meaning 11 Events for 53 shooting days in this case."]},{"l":"Event Structure","p":["Because there are no folders for Events we have to be creative with the naming. It may look frightening, but in practice it's a minor issue. As Editors we are used to long lists and many files. That said: all FCP-Professionals wish for Event-Folders and Apple is aware of that. We will get them eventually.","All the Events of episode 5, roughly 100.","Alright, we do it the old way then, with a prefix before the name that sorts the Events accordingly. The Events are named with scene numbers, sometimes we use Emojis or additional text to describe the state of the scene.","Sorting system with * and Spaces in the beginning of Event-names","A scene Event contains the Sync Clips + the Compound Clips with the Assembly or Rough-Cut versions + additional files such as wild tracks. Tight and tidy and helps with orientation.","One single scene with around 30 clips (takes) in it.","The Scene-Compounds then are assembled into a timeline. In this way we can easily rearrange the order of scenes, test out music or different versions of scenes. Below you can see that some scenes havent been shot yet. So we place title-cards as placeholders. Close to the fine-cut we take blocks of scenes and put them into bigger Compound Clips. In this way we can see the wider flow of the episode and refine the edit inside the Compounds.","Rather late in the process, maybe 3 days before Picture Lock, we break apart the Compounds to have the whole episode in front of us for last refinements. This is both, an organising decision and an efficiency measure, because FCP is still getting slower with complex timelines longer than 30 minutes. If youre working in reels the App stays snappy.","Episode 2 in the timeline, with several Compound Clips of different lengths"]},{"l":"Notion Database","p":["To complement the flood of footage and keep 4 Editors in the loop about the shooting schedule we use notion.so.

We can look ahead what is coming the next days, what is shot, but not yet delivered to us and what is ready to edit.","View of a notion database, every shooting day is a column, every column shows cards for the scheduled scenes","Each scene is represented by a card. It provides a summary of the state of shooting and syncing. Additionally there is a screenshot, special comments from director and Assistant Editor. We can write notes of our own about the state of editing in case someone else will pick up the scene later on, and even report back to the set, for example to the Script Supervisor.","Notion card in detail, different properties like Location, notes, shooting day and episode are filled with information","You can sort and filter the database. In this case (below), the list shows shots that are not yet finished or have missing data.","A smaller list, which only shows scenes that comply with the selected filter requests","Or you can simply have a nice gallery of your episode to get an impression of the visual concept. Great for directors and DoPs!","A gallery view of episode 1. storyboard style."]},{"i":"line-by-lines-parts","l":"Line-by-Lines (Parts)","p":["Line-by-Lines, or parts, as I call it, is the process of splitting every take of one scene into little chunks, usually for one line of dialogue or one particular action. These little chunks are reordered so that you can watch every similar part of every take in succession. In this way you can quickly compare every angle and find the best shot or dialogue.","Shortly before our production started Chris Hocking had the Titles to Keywords feature for CommandPost ready (commissioned by Knut Hake) and it rendered my old workflow obsolete. Before, we would tag every Sync Clip in the Browser with keywords. Even with dedicated shortcuts and scripting it was not an easy task. If you made a mistake and had to go back one step you could loose orientation. Now, we can complete the entire process within a timeline and with titles and we can also adjust each step throughout the process.","As you can see below its as easy as:","Create a title with dedicated name (e.g. part 01)","Copy it over to the next take, adjust length, and so on","then you send it to Titles to Keywords and are presented with an Event, where all takes are thoroughly tagged with a keyword for every part , which you can then rename with more information, if needed. (screenshot further down below)","This process even works with Multicams and stacked Sync Clips (multiple cameras layered in sync with TC).","Timeline with all takes in a row. above it titles with different lenghts are placed on the clips","finished Event, one keyword is selected. one short line in each take is highlighted yellow to demonstrate the ability to find a moment in the take very fast","For the sake of efficiency my approach is to not have every line, but 2-3 lines (around 20-25 seconds) in one keyword. This is small enough to have good orientation and, at the same time, not too many keywords, which also can be distracting. Depending on the length of the scene, we would have 5-9 keywords for our \"parts\"-system. The new process takes around than 20 minutes per scene, compared to the old approach, which could take up to 1 hour. The result is something like what's shown in the picture above: When you click on the keyword, which has parts of dialogue or a description of the moment in the name, you can quickly find the line you're looking for (circled in yellow). With the skimmer, it's a matter of milliseconds to play them in succession, select one, and exchange it with the take in the timeline. I also use this for the initial selection process in longer scenes. This is an excellent way to compare different takes on a macro-level."]},{"l":"Deliveries","p":["After Picture Lock we sent:","FCPXML to DaVinci Resolve for Color Grading and VFX","AAF via X2Pro to Sound Design and Music (if the timelines are well maintained beforehand sound-designers will be happy)","Lists for ADR, DI, VFX, Motion Design and Music via Producers Best Friend"]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Even though we edited in three different places simultaneously and moved to Berlin in the middle of the production everything went fairly smooth.","CommandPost s Title to Keywords sped up the AE-workflow significantly.","Final Cut and PostLab enabled us to concentrate on the creative work and even jump between episodes to build a compelling story.","The visuality of the Browser, the Magnetic Timeline and the overall efficiency of Final Cut Pro provide us with the necessary tools to be creative, even in time-demanding scenarios."]},{"l":"About the Author","p":["After his studies of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany, Florian Duffe started as an Assistant Editor in feature films (Hell, FCP 7, 2010, Finsterworld, Avid MC, 2013).","He made his debut as main Editor with Luna (FCPX, 2015) and has since cut several Movies (Tatort) and Series for national Television, most of them in Final Cut Pro.","In 2020 he was credited Associate Editor at the team of dystopian Sci-Fi-Thriller The Colony (FCPX, Director: Tim Fehlbaum, Editor: Andreas Menn).","Follow Florian here:","bluesky"]},{"l":"Poster"},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"indias-space-odyssey","l":"India’s Space Odyssey","p":["India’s Space Odyssey, the science documentary produced by Miditech Studios for Warner Bros.

I am a Producer-Director and Editor based in New Delhi, India. I collaborate on independent projects while also running my own creative production company called The Qurious Studio. I am the Editor on the Discovery+ India science documentary India’s Space Odyssey. It bagged the award for Best Current Affairs programme for a single Asian market at the Content Asia Awards.","I have used FCP X since its inception in 2011, while we were still working on FCP 7 and I have been a FCPX user ever since FCP 7. The transition from FCP 7 to FCPX was fairly smooth for me, however it was not the same story out there. For most editors the change was overwhelming, particularly the Producers and Production companies became extremely hesitant towards editing on FCPX. And with FCP7 dissolving, premiere occupied most of its space.","So, when I was asked to edit Space Odyssey, like a disclaimer, I had to tell them I edit on FCPX and if that is cool. Now, FCPX has to not just struggle with lack of information on it but also misinformation in the popular circle. I addressed few of their concerns holding my ground with confidence and then I believe they did not had much of a choice given the pandemic as well, so they gave it a nod.","India’s Space Odyssey is the story of the Indian Space Program that goes six decades back to as early as 1962 and before. That meant there was going to be a plethora of data to be managed, while we edit. A lot of which has to be archival footage, in all kinds of files and formats and the last thing to be shoot data. Like I remember the first batch of data, about 20 GB, sourced from NASA archives was eventually never used. All that clubbed with the data, Pria who produced and directed, and her team, shooting remotely in different parts of the world, would also come to my edit studio as they happen.","So I could anticipate much in advance that the core need on this project would be to have a robust data management within FCPX and outside as well. I took some time before the data could start coming in to do some homework on organising and structuring data, in order to follow a process that helps me when the project grows up to be complex. For this specific process demand, I could bring everything to work from keyword collections, smart collections to notes and metadata. Further I spoke to a few seniors but mostly wanted to peek into any pro editors process. Looking around YouTube, I feel most fcpx tuts/videos are often created in context to YouTube content only and there’s limited resources on YouTube for Pro editors. But I did find some help, one of the helpful videos I easily recall was from This Guy Edits, that helped look around the process of an editor to a Academy Nominated Doc. In conclusion, I think by end of project nothing else proved more crucial than doing that homework on organising and building a process to manage data because I never missed or struggled to find a file till the project finished.","Outside FCPX, I had used a drive cloning application to make an automated clone of the drive I was working on every few hours, since I was editing from my home studio and there were no RAID Storages.","Further, I had introduced Frame.io to the production team, since review and feedback were in question as I insisted on editing at my home studio and did not wanted to edit at a rental studio given my COVID-19 precautions/reservations. At the end Frame.io just didn’t turn out to be a saviour but it was so well received that it was further used by the production team on their other projects as well.","In terms of editing, I was editing on a 2017 27-inch iMac with 24GB RAM and an external monitor and I’ve never had a considerable hiccup with regards to FCPX’s performance and stability. It is one of those reasons that I had never left FCPX for, it is safe, stable and unbothering. Good organising, optimising legacy formats, keeping ample space in drives, managing volumes of render files, using Video-Audio roles from scratch, easy multicam syncing-editing and good old cutting were some key highlights to my workflow. Additionally, the documentary, perhaps due to budget constraints, was also colour corrected and graded in FCPX mostly using default tools. All in all, I could simply focus much more on the creative aspect of edit and lesser on the technical requirements once correctly setup. The FCPX workflow allowed me to have the headspace to discuss the edit creatively with my director and address creative concerns.","That said, there were still some genuine questions during the project, some answered and some had to be taken outside FCPX for help. Those addressed were like when exporting master the Discovery specification required a .mxf (OP1a) and I had to dig internet to learn and satisfy my director, that FCPX’s MXF export is by default wrapped in OP1a format. Others that did not find an answer were like the LKFS parameter, for which I could not find a solution within FCPX and I had to take my export file to Premiere Pro which had a LKFS meter.","Beyond performance and stability, I also use FCPX because I find the interface design much less intimidating and chaotic as compared to its contemporaries. The only complain is that there’s much less confidence in the industry on FCPX. And since I do not edit on any other NLE, I am turned down on many, many, more gigs compared to the numbers I am accepted on. Apple too seem to not take it with much seriousness as they do to their other products.

As you saw with \"Blood Red Sky\", I can be persistent when it comes to material I really believe in.","This time we shot a lot outside, on real locations. That generally creates more of a mood and a better atmosphere. For our little town of Sonnenberg, we went to Vysluní in the former Sudetenland. The story we're telling could have actually happened there. There is a big neo-Romanesque church there in the center [...] this had been desecrated by the communist government, which gave us the opportunity to really shoot our showdown there. To shoot an homage to the Italo-Western with a shootout in a church has always been my dream. Accordingly, the church was the main reason why we chose Vysluní as the location.","Netflix was the gamechanger for me.

With Blood & Gold we moved into a new studio in Berlin which made us reconsider a few key aspects of our workflow.","We've been using PostLab for a couple of years already and love the stress-free collaboration and its backup abilities. Working on large libraries requires a lot of up- and downloading which were constrained by our internet bandwidth. I setup a PostLab Local server on a M1 Mac mini which greatly reduced upload times (down to around 60 secs from previously 10-15 mins). The instructions to setup a Local server can be found in the Hedge documentation and we were able to set it up in 2 days without any prior knowledge of GitLab. For additional security we implemented Tailscale (Wireguard VPN) to restrict access to the server, which also allows us to access libraries remotely.","We considered a Jellyfish NAS for our media management, but couldn't justify the cost for our 2-person studio. PostLab Drive is a great tool for working remotely, but it still requires all media to be uploaded to their server. We were looking for a similar tool that would keep our media in sync which lead me to Syncthing. It allows you to sync directly over your local ethernet network, but also syncs peer-to-peer over WAN access. For additional security these connections are also running through Tailscale. This setup allows us to be very mobile and we solely work off OWC Envoy Pro SX 4TB drives which are super-fast and rugged. In addition we keep daily backups on two OWC ThunderBay Flex 8 drives.","Before shooting started we talked with our post-production supervisor, sound recordist, script supervisor, camera department and DIT on set to align our workflows.","We discuss editing codecs and naming of media files. We usually prefer ProRes 422 LT files because of the excellent quality to size ratio that is suitable for cinema screenings.","It is especially important to make sure they shoot with permanently synced timecode.

I said straight away I was going to edit this on FCP. Augusto told me, \"I don't really care what you use to edit. That's your thing. Run with it\".","FCP is so fast that we spent more time focusing on the creative aspect of editing and not on the technical ones.","For sound turnovers, she used X2Pro to create AAFs, which our sound team praised.

To create the legal audio, we exported each episode out as a AIFF, then brought it into RX7 to make compliant then brought back into FCP. We prefer this method, rather than using a compound clip and a loudness plugin within FCP.","For the few Odyssey 50fps clips that spanned multiple files, we decided to just manually combine them within a synchronized clip in FCP. We also manually synced the slowed-down audio using a clapperboard, so we had that as a reference.","For this year, Fremantle developed a 5-part spin-oﬀ series titled “Neighbours: Erinsborough High”, delving deeper into the lives of the teen characters at Erinsborough High with more complex storylines reflective of issues faced by teens universally. Creator Jason Herbison and Series Producer Natalie Lynch stepped away from the traditional look and tone of Neighbours, creating a darker look and broody feel.","How did you get involved in this project?","I did all of the sound design myself directly within FCP with the help of iZotope RX7, ERA 4 Bundle Pro, and a handful of other Waves plugins. There were a couple of tricky lines that I needed to take out to RX7 standalone to cleanup, but most of the time I could do any noise reduction right on the FCP timeline with RX7.","I have a huge hatred of emoji’s in general, and refuse to use them on my phone, however, they’re a massive help in FCP to allow you eye to easily navigate to something.

The fact that it’s very powerful yet so quiet and easy to transport (thanks to its top handle), makes it an ideal on-set shared storage system.","Luckily, as I’ve worked with Jaque the cinematographer before, we had a really good on-set relationship. So he was happy for me to essentially act as a 2nd AC in a lot of ways. We were also very fortunate that we’ve worked with a lot of the other crew on various other jobs over the years, so every one was very happy and excited to be mixing things up.","Luckily, the producers gave us a huge amount of freedom and trust to use whatever tools we wanted, and allowed us to design our own workflow. We started chatting with the team in May, by July it was agreed that LateNite would handle the full post production workflow using Final Cut Pro.","Mixing 5 x TV half episodes all within FCP was more time consuming for me compared to using a DAW such as Protools or Logic Pro. However, the benefit was that if I couldn’t fix something easily in the sound design stage (we didn’t have time to do ADR for example), I could simply adjust the edit there and then. If I came up with an audio-based gag, I could also adjust the edit to make things work.","Most of the cast were still also working on the main show simultaneously, which made this project a massive logistical endeavour for the production team. As we were constantly jumping back and forth between locations due to cast availabilities, we uploaded frame grabs of each scene to Dropbox so that our DP could easily compare lighting setups. To do this, Kevin would just insert a shot from each scene into a temporary timeline, bulk change the duration to one frame, then use CommandPost’s Timeline Batch Export feature to export individual stills with the same clip naming.","Neighbours is the longest-running drama series on Australian television, celebrating its 35th Anniversary in 2020. It is produced by Fremantle and still today is viewed by a global audience of millions, making it one of Australia's most successful media exports.","Once a card dump was synced, keywords applied, clips rejected and favourited, we’d then merge these events into our master library on the Jellyfish and delete the temporary library. In terms of splitting the workload between Kevin & myself, generally I would do all the data wrangling and syncing, then either Kevin or myself would do the keywords and rejection/favourites.","Once in keyword collections, we reject any unusable bits of footage, and favourite anything that stands out. The great thing about the Sound Devices 788T is that you can set it up to prefix filenames with an @ symbol if they’re “circled takes”. We’d then manually rename these clips after they’ve been synced to use an emoji for an easy visual cue:","Once we had copied the rushes to three drives, we then used good old drag and drop to bring the media into FCP. We would create a new temporary library for each card dump, where we’d bring in the media, give the two cameras an angle label, then use Sync-N-Link to sync them up, using the filename from the audio files.","Our company LateNite Films has had close ties with Neighbours for a number of years. My business partner Nicholas Colla is currently directing a block of the main show and his wife (and LateNite writer director/producer) Nicolette Minster wrote Episode 1 of this spin-oﬀ series. When Neighbours producers Natalie Lynch & Natalie Mandel were in the planning stages for Erinsborough High, they reached out to us to get a quote for the visual effects and colour grading for the series because they loved our work on The Wizards of Aus - a series we did a few years back that premiered as 3 x 30’ episodes for television and later released as a 6-part web-series on YouTube.","Our in-house LateNite colourist and editing guru, Kevin Luk was on-set with me for the shoot, and we were setup in one of the spare production oﬃces. I originally was going to setup a standing desk on one of our Magliner trolleys - but I ended up loaning that to the production team to make transporting gear around the studio easier, so I improvised.","The cast is a mix of regulars from the main series and new faces, along with some students and teachers who've previously only appeared on the main show in a guest capacity. The series runs in parallel to the main show, as the disappearance of a Year 12 student during the exam period leads to some surprising revelations from the students.","The Jellyfish was our “master” drive, and the two 4TB SDDs were our backups. Each night both Kevin and myself would take a drive home for safety, and I would backup my drive to another hard drive overnight.","The main show has a very traditional paper-based workflow, with lots of marked up scripts for the editors, continuity notes, camera reports, sound reports, etc. and they’re used to doing a maximum of two card dumps a day - so it was definitely a little bit of a shock to the system for the 1st AD when we demanded much more regular card dumps, and requested no physical paper of anything.","The Neighbours team produces 259 episodes a year for the main show. From story plotting to on-screen It takes six months, and from filming to on-screen it’s 11 weeks. They assemble rushes daily, then have a 2-3 day directors cut, and a 1-2 day producers lock-oﬀ for the oﬄine. As you can imagine their post team is pretty much always flat out, so adding an additional 5 half-hour episodes was obviously going to put a lot of additional stress on their already busy department.","The next week, we had one more day with the director to do any final tweaks that he wanted to do, and another day with him to build recaps for each episode, then it was straight into finishing.","The original plan was for the in-house Neighbours post team to handle data wrangling and oﬄine editing using Media Composer at their studios in Nunawading, then we’d tackle grade, sound, online and delivery. As we learned more about the series, we explained the advantages of taking the whole post production process external.","The ProRes masters were delivered the post team at the main show who use Technicolor to do a final QC and review prior to dispatch. We used Producers Best Friend to generate music reports that were used to create music cue sheets.","The series follows the highs and lows of the residents of Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, providing an entertaining reflection of today’s diverse community.","The shoot was 2 days of exteriors with minimal crew, 5 days in the studio, and 1 day of exterior pickups. Everything was on the studio grounds, with the exception of an afternoon shooting at an actual school across the road from the studio.","The show was shot on two Sony FS7s. Majority of the footage was shot to 1920x1080 ProRes @ 25fps, however for the occasional 50fps shot, they switched over to recording to an out-board Odyssey 7Q+, also in ProRes, as the camera can’t capture 50fps in ProRes natively. We’re very much used to shooting 4K or 8K, and it wouldn’t have had any impact on our post workflow, but it was decided to just shoot HD to stay consistent with the main show.","The sound recordist (the legendary John McKerrow) was using a Sound Devices 788T which was timecode synced to both cameras using Tentacle Sync’s. We made sure the sound recordist accurately labelled all tracks, and did circle takes where appropriate. We’d use a EPISODE-SCENE SHOT-TAKE filename, which we’d later use in FCP to label our rushes.","This article was originally written for fcp.co in 2018. Ronny Courtens has kindly allowed us to release it on FCP Cafe. Thank you! Thank you to Tyler Nelson for formatting for FCP Cafe!","This was fantastic, as it meant we were cutting with pictures that looked the way the DOP intended. Kevin also had a calibrated Eizo monitor connected to his iMac, which meant we could accurately judge the footage on-set.","To me, “driving” Final Cut Pro feels the same as taking control of an Autodesk Flame or Smoke - you truly feel like an artist and a musician, where the tools can keep up with your mental thought process.","We decided early on to attempt to do the grade, sound design and delivery all within Final Cut Pro for both schedule and budget reasons, but also to creative flexibility as we could adjust the edit as needed when doing both sound design.","We did one final half day of pickups on a Monday, then we packed up our temporary oﬃce and moved back into the LateNite oﬃce. Kevin spent the afternoon finishing oﬀ the assemblies of all episode, then he handed over the controls to me to take over editing.","We ended up with a tiny 2.17 TB of rushes at the end of the production. Because the shooting schedule was so intense, there was no time for the director or cinematographer to review rushes. When shooting in the studios, the producers had camera feeds into their production oﬃces so they could review throughout the day.","We then had Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday morning to do a directors cut of all Episodes ready for a producers screening on the Thursday at 3pm. Over the years, we’ve competed in and won quite a few 48 Hour Film Project competitions. So, whilst the schedule was fairly intense, it wasn’t as scary or stressful as some projects we’ve done in the past.","We tried to do as many regular card dumps as we could - generally around 6 a day. Because we were all in the same location, I would get a text message from the Script Supervisor when they were close to wrapping a scene, and I would walk up ready to collect the two camera cards, and a sound card. I’d then take it back to our little lair, and use Hedge to backup the cards to two 4TB SSDs and to the Jellyfish.","We used a Blackmagic MultiDock 10G via USB-C for dumping the Odyssey SSDs, and a USB3 reader for dumping the XQD cards. The Sound Devices cards came to us as CF cards.","We used the same folder structure as we use for all jobs. We have a folder for rushes, and then have sub- folders for each application. We don’t use a template or Post Haste, as I don’t like having a bunch of empty folders making things messy. Instead we just have a standard procedure that all our staﬀ follow, so everything’s consistent.","We’d then go through and keyword everything into ScriptSync-style keywords for easy access. Kevin built these keywords based oﬀ the script prior to the shoot, and we modified them as needed.","When a card dump was all organised and in the master library, Kevin would start putting together an assembly edit, with generator placeholders for missing scenes based on the script.","When we first started shooting, we had Daryl Watson (the incredible script supervisor) working oﬀ a Shot Notes X Excel template, which we intended to import back in as metadata. However, after the first couple of card dumps we decided against this, as we were getting “circle takes” and scene/shot/take in the sound metadata anyway. Rather than go oﬀ his “favourites”, we had time to do our own selects when reviewing and assembling the footage anyway. We still got Daryl to email us the Excel documents at each card dump as a reference if needed, but we didn’t actually use Shot Notes X in the end.","When we first started toying with the idea of taking over the entire post workflow for this series, we knew that the only way we’d agree to do it is if we had the freedom to use Final Cut Pro as our tool of choice - as opposed to Avid Media Composer, which is used on the main show. I’m very used to an Avid workflow and whilst I love certain aspects about it, I feel way more creative when I use Final Cut Pro.","When we heard that this series was edited and finished in Final Cut Pro by LateNite Films, I decided to sit down with Chris Hocking, one of the founders the company and also the creator of the free and open source automation tool 'CommandPost'. We will talk in detail about how they used Final Cut Pro to not only edit the entire series, but also handle the grade, the sound design, and the final delivery. Enjoy!","Written by Ronny Courtens."]},{"l":"CommandPost","p":["A scrolling timeline.","Ability to Ignore Inserted Camera Cards.","Absolutely.

In this way a user can apply and execute different prompts just by selecting the single set.","Perhaps this thing I wrote may sound a bit ... “ pompous,” or “ self-praising,” however, I tried very hard to think from the end user's point of view: the organization of prompts into sets allows you to generate an immense amount of content by simply doing two clicks by first selecting the set and then running the analysis.","My competitor with this application, MacWhisper, an application that I greatly value and respect (let me be clear!) has been providing for several months now the ability to query ChatGPT with prompts, but these must be written by hand.","My system, on the other hand, provides for doing the work once, and then applying it later all the times automatically, and in the case of more common prompts, these are ready-made and implemented by yours truly.","The system by the way allows for prompts and sets to be updated, continuously, without having to update the application."]},{"i":"one-small-planet-many-different-languages","l":"One small planet, many different languages","p":["When I started writing the first prompts-which, I recall, are the “ questions” posed to the artificial intelligence to be answered-I thought I would have to create numerous prompts in all the languages I wanted to support.","Of course, I started with English, thinking that I would then be able to translate all these prompts more or less automatically, specifying the language as well.","Later, almost by accident, I submitted an Italian text for analysis using English prompts. To my surprise, I noticed that in most cases the response was still given in Italian. By repeating the processing several times, I was sometimes getting answers in Italian, sometimes in English.","It is important to know that unless you intentionally force them, the responses of all these artificial intelligence systems, not just ChatGPT, have a component of probabilistic variability. This means that, using the exact same prompt, you can get very different results as well.","These systems do not really understand languages, but rather are formidable imitators of human language. They do not even know the words themselves, but rather the particles that make them up (in jargon called tokens). They respond by trying to find the best solution to the question formulated.","If most of the text is in Italian, even if the question is asked in English, there is a good chance they will answer in Italian.","So I went a step further: at all system prompts I specified to answer using the same language as the content, even if the question is in English. In this way, I was able to achieve a very high success rate: to date, out of more than 200 prompts, in only one case was the answer given in English against a text in Italian. By repeating the request, I obtained the desired solution.","In conclusion, with a margin of error of less than 1% (and probably much less), NQR provides results in the same language as the content being analyzed.

And we were still talking about GPT-3 a couple of years ago. I had seen with my very own eyes, finally, a machine pass the Turing test brilliantly.","But then, as with all things, I delved deeper, had my own experience, and realized which things LLMs do excellently and which, still, struggle to solve even with sufficiency.","Given that these tools are continually improving, at a breakneck pace (but at some point the power consumption will be so high that they cannot go beyond a certain ceiling), I have learned to exploit them for what they are: a great help, an excellent kick-start, something that can get you out of the deadlock of the white paper, but definitely not a final solution.","When I record an episode of my podcast, rather quickly, I take advantage of these tools to have description, tags, title. But then, for the most important information, I get on the keyboard and correct the errors, take out what is not needed and add the misses.","My philosophy is to take this metadata that is generated and rework it in such a way that from a “just enough” level you get to “more than satisfactory.”","You have to look at the responses of artificial intelligence a little bit like the work of a newly hired intern: you always have to check what it is doing, because, in the end, anyway, the people who put the face on it are us..."]},{"l":"Discovering hidden things","p":["When I handed over the final version of the application to the guys at FxFactory for them to publish on the store, I then focused on the prompts.","Since these could be added and changed without updating the application, I thought it would be a nice gift for all users to have as much functionality as possible ready “ out of the box”.","Always starting from the content I create, particularly the wine podcast, I developed some prompts that allowed me to have a fresh look at the content itself.","Initially I started with URLs: I wanted to know what links were being quoted in the broadcast, so I created this prompt:","A relatively simple thing that, however, when I ran it, made me discover that there were many more references in an episode than I remembered:","For me it was really a revelation: the clever “ stupidity” of LLMs had made me discover something I had forgotten.","Now, if you think about it for a moment, this is one of the most important and relevant things about this whole article, but also about everything we think or can think about this class of tools!","These objects do a cold analysis, without love, without passion, without even understanding what they are doing, however, they do it rather precisely. I emphasize: “ rather precise,” not “ infallible,” let me be clear.","Simply put, they make us discover or, better yet, rediscover something about the content, so that we can really have metadata that also has semantic meaning!","I went ahead and developed other prompts, such as this one that identifies brands:","Or this one that tries to figure out who the participants are if they are mentioned:","I realize that I have only begun to scratch the surface of what can be done.

Basically, instead of me writing what I needed, as I always did, I asked the artificial intelligence, again via one of NQR's prompts, to write the prompt for generating the image, to be passed then, by copying and pasting it, into Firefly.","It is interesting this first level of recursiveness: one prompt generating another prompt...","But then, since OpenAI has the API to directly generate images with the DALL-E model, I thought it would be nice to bypass this whole round. At a not insignificant cost-we're speaking of a few cents, not a few thousandths-I decided to go ahead with direct generation.","That said, as of now images can be generated directly from within Transcriber!","You can choose the model, DALL-E 2 or DALL-E 3 (DALL-E 2 is absolutely unqualifiable in quality, I think they only keep it on because there are some applications that use it). For DALL-E 3 you can choose to generate a square or 16:9 image, either horizontally or vertically.","You can also choose to generate a standard image or one with a “vivid” pattern, which creates more aesthetically pleasing results that look more like stock photos instead of regular photos.","Generating a 16:9 image comes in at a cost of $0.12."]},{"i":"money-money-money","l":"Money, Money, Money!","p":["But how much does this stuff cost?","Probably by the time you read this article I will have updated Transcriber with the new version of the system that also shows how much you paid per generation.","The costs, using the GPT-4o-mini model, are really low: we're talking about $0.15 per million prompt tokens($0.60 per million response tokens), which translates, roughly speaking, to something like $0.003-0.004 for a single prompt and its response on a 30-minute video.","Simply put, doing a dozen or so prompts, more or less, with even an image, you end up spending something in the range of $0.15-0.25.","If you are not interested in image generation, the costs drop into the range of $0.01-0.03!","A lot? Little?

And what ties it to ChatGPT? I will try to explain things in a simple and certainly inaccurate way, so those who understand a little about artificial intelligence, plug their ears...","Whisper is a transformer, and while Siri, Alexia, and Google try to understand the word or phrase that was spoken, Whisper goes a little bit wide and also tries to understand the context of each phoneme, and through a very broad knowledge base as well as statistical calculations, tries to make each word follow the word that makes the most sense, consistent with what is being spoken.","Whisper's wide model takes up a good 3GB, a little more in memory when it runs, but it is still to be considered a \"basic\" model, probably ChatGPT four is at least 100 times bigger - which is why it will be difficult to run something like this on our computers.","Rose-water technical details aside, this is one explanation of why Whisper is so much more accurate and also succeeds where other transcription systems stall: in the unfortunate event that it does not understand a word or part of a word, it \"reconstructs\" it from what comes before and what comes after.","Another major struggle was to \"teach\" (although perhaps the correct term would be to specify) Whisper to also generate punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, question marks, and escalation marks.","Pay attention to this: when you dictate to Siri you have to specify the punctuation mark you want to add.","Small color note: this very article is accomplished by dictating to Siri while I am moving between home and office by car.","One of the great peculiarities of Whisper is that it can also figure out what punctuation marks are, but this is not something it does automatically, you have to specify some input parameters so that it understands that the context has to include them as well."]},{"l":"Before the prototype","p":["In short, teased by the Twitter discussion and the endorsement, I started playing around with this system, trying to figure out what I could get out of it and what the limitations of the technology were.","I think I managed to make a very first prototype, with, of course, a horrible user interface within 7-10 days. And, of course, I started testing it with all the work I was doing in March 2023, projects of various kinds: from pharmaceutical video presentations to a video game trailer to some tutorials.","Here I encountered the first limitations of Whisper, which performs exceptionally well when the audio is quite clear, content with a speaker or interviews, while it goes deeply into crisis in case music or sound effects are present.","Initially, I told myself that this would not be a big problem, just specify in the requirements that the application was best suited for spoken content, nevertheless I felt the need to refine it, so I rolled up my sleeves and wondered if there was a possibility of parsing the audio in such a way as to find the points where there was speech and then eliminate those where there was only music or sound effects.","I succeeded by taking advantage of some libraries provided by Apple for analyzing sounds. Subsequently, one thing I have been working on in parallel with both this app and the one that does text-to-speech is the highlighting of sentences in sync with the video (or, rather, with the audio).","I always thought that when doing a speech review, physically, the people in charge have in front of them a sheet, printed in Courier font, with all the features of the script. For this very reason I wanted the words and sentences to be written in this same style, not so much for skeuomorphism, but because it is still the most effective and efficient method of reading the text while listening to the related audio.","I worked not a little in such a way as to continuously highlight the line of text that is \"spoken\" at a particular moment in time.","When there is information that varies over time, the concept of a timeline is one of the strongest: it transforms the horizontal axis into that of time, so the playhead moves from left to right as the playback continues.","Showing in a two-dimensional screen information that evolves over time is never a trivial matter, not least because it involves making user interfaces and real-time interaction methods, which in some ways have more to do with video games than with video writing programs...","This is why I am particularly proud of this part of the code; not only is the segment highlighted with the sentence being spoken, but it is also easy to interact with it by correcting any transcription errors.","It sounds like a breeze, but believe me, it's not!"]},{"l":"3GB of passion","p":["Another big problem stemmed from the fact that the model I wanted to use, again in open source and with respect to legality, takes up a good 3GB, as I mentioned earlier.","Downloading a 3GB application, as annoying as it may seem, is not that problematic, for the installation to begin with.","But then I thought about all the times there would be a need for an upgrade, and downloading 3 GB of stuff, most of it always the same, would be particularly troublesome, especially in areas of the world where connection speeds are not comparable to those of the big European or North American metropolises.","So I set to work on making a system that would allow the downloading of the template only the first time, and among other things in \"shared\" mode, so that in case I wanted to develop another application based on the same technology, it could safely use the model already downloaded (spoiler: thing I have actually already done with FCP Video Tag)."]},{"l":"The field test","p":["\"Of course yes!\", I replied, and the fact that I had a real use case, with tight deadlines and a not inconsiderable qualitative demand, led me to work heavily on the application, so as to improve as much as possible the interface and also the possibility of exporting the subtitles in different formats, including text with total transcription, unsynchronized, and later also RTF with time code indication in a different style.","And it was during the interviews that it was asked if it was possible to have even a rough transcript of what was being said for medical and scientific review.","And since Transcriber's purpose is to extract the subtitles from the audio, I thought, more or less simply, to add precisely the subtitle overlay to the video, so the eyes are all and always in the same area of the screen.","At the end of April I had to go to Florence to attend a medical conference and do several interviews with many doctors, in a total of 12 languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, and Brazilian Portuguese.","I patted myself on the back because this stuff, in the end, among the transcription applications, I guess I only had it...","I told myself that there had to be a way to \"split\" a subtitle while still keeping the text in sync with the video.","In practice, the traditional transcription process, which involved typing the texts while continuing to pause the video, translates into an automatic process of \"raw\" transcription, which must necessarily be followed by a (much faster) checking phase.","In the end I decided that, as an option enabled by default, the system tries to figure out whether the user has pressed the ENTER button to wrap, and when it is pressed, the split sentence automatically generates two subtitles that are fairly synchronized to the video, where \"fairly\" means \"more or less imperceptibly.\"","Just by making these doctor interview videos, I told myself that by keeping the video played at the top of the interface separate with the transcribed text at the bottom, the user's attention would be focused on only one of the two.","Just looking at the overlay subtitles, I realized that although I had struggled not a little to try to get Whisper to digest the punctuation marks, in some cases the sentences were so long that they would result in huge subtitles that would take up too much of the screen.","Let me be clear: I have always considered Transcriber as a semi-automatic tool, this means that the transcription should still be reviewed a human being.","The boundary conditions are simple: artificial intelligences are very fast, very efficient and also very effective, but they don't understand what they are doing; it's just data to them. It's up to us to maintain control.","This also sounds like a no-brainer, but it's not, not least because the system, during playback, continuously updates itself (about 30 times per second) to try to figure out where it is, among all the phrases being spoken which one is active at that instant of time, and then highlights it at the bottom and shows the text content superimposed on the video.","This has led to better fluidity in handling the interface and the ability to interact very easily and very quickly on the text stream.","This is the philosophy of all the apps I make: automate as much as possible, while still leaving control, verification and, not least, responsibility to a flesh-and-blood guy.","You see, my applications are born and grow in a fairly almost \"autistic\" way, but then it is really with user testing (and also when I make tutorials) that I discover the limitations and areas where they can be improved."]},{"l":"Text Editor","p":["One of the features of Transcriber that I like best is the text editor, the subtitle editor.","From a purely technical and data structure point of view, each of the scripts corresponds to a different record in the document's \"internal database,\" called the Session.","When working with text, however, for example with Microsoft Word or Pages, what appears in the sheet is a single text that can be edited easily.","I did a lot of work so that text editing would be as similar as possible to that of a traditional word processor, while still allowing for the ability to manage how the texts remain \"attached\" (i.e., synchronized) to the video.","The whole component of transcription, and managing the synchronized texts, was one of the most complex but at the same time also quite elegant things I have ever done.","I tried to make things as simple as possible and as intuitive as possible for the user, while going out of my way to mask any complexities.","If a title is too long, it is highlighted with a red dot which means that, given its length, it would take up too much space in the frame.","The user then has the option of standing anywhere in the text and pressing the ENTER button to wrap, and by wrapping, in a natural way, the subtitle is broken into two different titles while still keeping all the words in sync.","Said like that sounds like a piece of cake, but believe me, this is something non-trivial! And this is also how I have operated with regard to the separation of subtitles while they are being transcribed and generated: trying to isolate sentences or sentence segments (separated by commas, \",\") as much as possible, so that we always have meaningful content to display, without truncated sentences or with subjects being in one subtitle and verbs being in another subtitle."]},{"i":"i-got-a-publisher","l":"I got a publisher!","p":["At the end of 2022 I was contacted by the guys at FxFactory because they were interested in publishing some of my apps on their store, on their marketplace.","This filled me with joy, pride, and also with fear: for the first time I would be playing in the big leagues, and I would have to maintain much higher quality standards; this time I would not be doing everything myself, but I would also have to be accountable to someone else for my work.","Initially we had planned to bring a couple of my most popular apps, such as BeatMark Pro or FCP Diet 2, to this marketplace, adding features and cleaning up the interface.","I, however, proposed that they start with a completely new app, whose name initially was Transcriptor.","I initially met some resistance, partly because such apps already existed, such as the aforementioned Macwhisper.","I then explained the reasons why this new app of mine could be something alternative and provide added and different value than the others.","In concomitance with NAB, where several apps that make use of artificial intelligence to aid production and post production were presented or announced, those in charge of FxFactory were convinced and switched on the green light.","One thing needs to be emphasized: FxFactory is not only a store, a showcase, but those who run it put their faces first and consequently require a level of quality, communication, and even user experience that is far superior to what I had up to that point.","If I had commercialized Transcriber all by myself, it would probably have come out in some form of its own in late April or early May 2023.","Instead, FxFactory raised my bar higher and higher, trying to reach heights of communication, user interface, functionality, and overall quality level that I was not used to.","And, I have to be honest, I don't think I can thank them enough for making me grow, and making me grow so fast."]},{"l":"Exporting to Final Cut Pro","p":["Initially Transcriber was not supposed to allow exporting subtitles to Final Cut Pro because I already have an application in my catalog that does just that, FCP SRT Importer 2, by the way one of my most successful applications (which means that the gentlemen at Apple and whoever is in charge of managing Final Cut Pro development should ask themselves some questions if so many people need such a basic feature...).","Let's say I didn't want to cannibalize myself, even though I knew Transcriber would be a higher cost application, there would probably be enough of a market for one to buy Transcriber bundled with FCP SRT Importer 2.","But then, again for that Florence job, I realized that the double step: transcribing the subtitles, revising, exporting the subtitles to SRT format, then bringing them back into FCP SRT Importer 2, and finally communicating the whole thing with Final Cut Pro, was really... a big pain in the ass!","In the end I had all the technology, the know-how, why not add this feature to Transcriber as well?","And so I did, in the span of only one day I added all the features that were already in FCP SRT Importer 2 directly inside Transcriber.","It has to be said that, having chosen to make the UI in SwiftUI, creating configuration panels was never very complex, and one could focus more on business logic than on appearance and user interaction.","In short, the app was taking shape the decidedly concrete way."]},{"l":"Multiple SRTs","p":["The work of doctors in Florence has evolved over time, and the client also asked me for the ability to view interviews, but with subtitles translated into various languages.","Nothing could be simpler: after doing the transcription and export in SRT format, I proceeded to have these subtitles translated; and then imported into FCP SRT Importer 2 to make the localized videos in the various languages.","This, however, resulted in a decidedly disrupted workflow where I could not actually see the effect of the translated subtitles without first exporting them, or making a peer comparison between each individual sentence from the original to the translated version.","So it is, in a moment of madness (Alex, for next time, remember not to do this kind of thing again with a product that has not yet been released!) I expanded the underlying model, the data structure, to allow multiple subtitle imports.","Basically now Transcriber allows you to have infinite streams of subtitles, in various languages, and also to show side by side the original and translated sentence.","It may sound like a triviality, but this is really a very powerful feature, especially for those working with \"minor\" languages, for which localization, translation, export, and management of different streams is an integral part of the production and post production process.","Basically, with all this work done under the hood, I had transformed Transcriber from an application that deals with a single link in the localization management chain, into an aggregation center that allows for a global and centralized view of projects, always in synchronization between text and video.","Oh boy, this stuff was getting serious!"]},{"l":"The Dome Factory","p":["In the meantime, we got to the beginning of June 2023, I kept asking to get the application launched, but the publisher kept asking me for more and more refinements and better management of the interface.","They were certainly right, but the timing of these final cleanups and subsequent approval left me with an open project, and every time I used it, which happens pretty much every day, I would come up with little features to add.","As a result, what should have been a \"Minimum Viable Product\" was becoming an increasingly complex application, and of course with the need to handle any bugs I would generate by adding new code."]},{"i":"videos-videos-videos","l":"Videos, videos, videos!","p":["Since I had started to develop a system for synthetic speech of more or less \"sufficient\" quality, I decided to change the way I make promotional videos and this time use a synthetic speaker.","This might be a more or less debatable choice, I am the first to fear very much the \"uncanny valley\" effect, but I believe that the quality level of synthetic voices has reached such a level that, in any case, at least from my point of view, it is preferable to a promotional video made with only overlay text.","So here I made my first promo video.","And, because the application is definitely complex, some things may even seem intuitive, but to understand how the workflow works in my opinion you need to sit down for a moment and understand a little bit what is the best way to operate, I decided to also make some tutorials of increasing complexity, making use of both screen captures and animations made with Adobe After Effects, which is the program I use most in my first job as a video maker.","This time I tried to maintain a distinctly high level of quality, not only in the promo but also for all the side videos, it was a really big effort, maybe it might not look like it, however trying to show things in a quick, effective, clear, understandable way without becoming pompous, is not a child's play...","Find all the videos I made for Transcriber here.","And, in addition, one important thing there is to say: every time I set out to make a tutorial, therefore trying to do things the way any user would do them, I find a lot of mistakes or things that can be improved, so to make a video of a few minutes, it can take me even several days because, in the meantime, I am working on the code

video I had made I had used an image taken from a very famous movie.","Nothing you can't see anyway in any kind of promotional material from this same movie, however, the publisher politely asked me to replace it with something else so as to avoid any copyright issues.","Datum done, in one day I revamped the promotional video and made all the art work.","I was basically ready to go."]},{"l":"The

mode (for the record: in the trial version it allows you to transcribe the first 45 seconds of the movie or import subtitles for the first 45 seconds).","I spent months raising expectations about this app on Twitter, to the point where I had probably lost some credibility as well: I felt I was ready to launch in late April, early May, and then instead it was a full two months later...","Was it worth the wait?","From the end users' point of view I don't know, from my point of view?","Heck, yes!","This was the craziest launch ever since I started having this small software development business.","Having a publisher like FxFactory behind me, I achieved in two weeks what I set out to achieve in two years!","This does not mean that I have become rich, this does not mean that the pressure has eased, and after the initial explosion, the values settle down to a more or less quiet regime.","And the first week, but perhaps also the second week, were weeks of great work on my part to improve the things that were missing, add the features that were requested, as well as fix some idiosyncrasies and bugs: I had never been able to test the application with complex languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and I found that syntactic construction and more or less \"special\" characters needed to be handled more accurately.","Let's say that I haven't slept, or slept very little, for about two weeks now..."]},{"i":"and-now","l":"And now?","p":["Now, that this app is in the world, since it is in the hands of so many people, I have discovered so many use cases and

In that ten years we’ve had a new version of Final Cut Pro with a whole new XML structure, and Premiere Pro CC has added import and export of Final Cut Pro classic XML.","There is a broad ecosystem of apps that depend on XML from Final Cut Pro X or Premiere Pro, many from our company, Intelligent Assistance Software.","Without the ability to round-trip XML it would be up to Apple to implement every single requested feature. We know full well that niche workflows — the type easily supported by XML — take a lot longer to reach the top of the implementation list. Many desirable features will never make it to the main app. An open, well documented, XML interchange format allows third party developers to fill these niches and extend Final Cut Pro X without having to seek permission from anyone."]},{"i":"what-is-xml","l":"What is XML?","p":["It’s likely you’ve heard the term XML and even used some of the workflow or translation apps that it enables, but still aren’t really sure what it is, and how it gets used. That’s not surprising because “XML” is an umbrella term for a way of presenting information that is:","Human and machine readable","Self-describing","When you first look at an XML file, it hardly seems human readable, but it is once you gain a little basic understanding. Most importantly it is readable by software, so Final Cut Pro X can import the XML that describes a Project, Event or Library. Similarly FCP classic and Premiere Pro can import Bins of clips and Projects from the appropriate XML.","That last point is important - from the appropriate XML - because there is no single “XML”. Each type of XML is unique to the application it supports because an XML file describes the data structures of that application.","It should come as no surprise, then that the XML from, or for, Final Cut Pro X is as completely different as Final Cut Pro X is from FCP classic (spoiler alert: there are no tracks in FCPX XML).","In fact, almost the first thing any XML file does is to declare what type of XML it is."]},{"l":"Figure 1","p":["Classic FCP (and Premiere Pro CC) is xmeml:","The modern Final Cut Pro X XML is fcpxml:","Motion .motn file (which is actually XML) is ozml:","These days, the dominant user of xmeml is Premiere Pro CC.

Throughout this article we’ll be comparing XML from Final Cut Pro X and from Premiere Pro CC.","The second main attribute — self-describing — is an important benefit we get with XML over other formats like an EDL, or Comma Separated Variables (CSV). With these other data formats we only get the data. It’s up to the user, or software, to know what each element represents."]},{"l":"Figure 2","p":["Here’s some data from an EDL:","With XML each element in the file describes exactly what type of data is going to be presented, as we'll see shortly. In the next section we’ll elaborate on what an element is, and how it fits into Final Cut Pro XML."]},{"i":"whats-inside-xml","l":"What’s inside XML?","p":["If you’ve done any HTML work for the web or other purpose, then you’ll probably notice that XML looks a little familiar. That’s not surprising because they are both Markup Languages (the ‘ML’ in both cases).","For the web we mark up text with a HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which works well for pages of text. But for editing (or motion graphics in Motion) we want to transfer an almost infinite range of different information, which is why the X is for eXtensible. HTML is limited to display options, whereas XML, because it's extensible, does not have limits to the type of data that can be marked up.","Both HTML and XML mark up using tags. HTML marks up blocks of text to tell the browser how to display it. XML marks up blocks of data with tags that tell us what type of information or data is stored.","These markup tags tell us what type of data is stored between the tag ‘open’ and the ‘close’. A simple HTML example would be like this:","There are two sets of tags in this example: the pair of 'p' tags tell the browser to display all the text between the opening p and closing /p tags as a paragraph, and the pair of b /b tags tell the browser to display the word \"beginning\" in bold.","Likewise in an XML file there are tags. but these tags tell the reader or computer what type of information is between the tags. Instead of paragraphs we might have timecode at the start of a Timecode entry, and /timecode at the end of a Timecode entry. Like the b /b tags in the paragraph above, all XML tags can nest as well. This means we can have this piece of XML code that gives keyword and marker details for a Clip (out of a FCP X XML export):","In this example, the keyword tag is “self closing” by the simple use of / inside the last . It also nests data within the tag as attributes. Start, duration and value are attributes for the tag keyword.","It’s a much more efficient structure, which is one of the reasons why fcpxml is so much more concise than xmeml. Expressed the old way without attributes this data would look something like:","XML tags define the type of data that is between the tags. An EDL file, which also carries data about clips and edits (but a much older format) contains only data. Unless you know in advance what each item in each line in the EDL above means, you can't infer it. With XML that data would be explicitly described by being marked up with tags. (An EDL file usually describes the types of data in the first line.)","Each type of XML file customizes the tags for the appropriate data in that file. Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro classic’s XML describes clips (and other items) within a project’s video and audio tracks. Final Cut Pro X’s XML describes clips (and others) within a project’s single primary storyline, with connected clips (and others) and secondary storylines connected to items in the primary storyline. That is why we can’t open XML out of Premiere Pro directly in Final Cut Pro X, or vice versa. They, literally, do not speak the same language.","So it’s important that we know which type of XML file we're talking about and which version. In Figure 1 you can see that we have the type of XML, and also the version number. The version number is also important. Final Cut Pro X version 10.2 can open version 1.5 of fcpxml, but it cannot open version 1.6 from 10.3. (Final Cut Pro X 10.3 allows saving as version 1.5 XML for this reason, and opens older versions of fcpxml.)"]},{"i":"xml-or-aaf","l":"XML or AAF?","p":["As well as Premiere Pro and FCP Classic, there are other applications like Media 100 and Sony Vegas — among others — that support xmeml. There is increasing support for Final Cut Pro X’s fcpxml format other than in the app itself. For example, Atomos recorders only output fcpxml, and Logic Pro X imports fcpxml. Resolve supports both versions for timelines.","The only NLE that supports no version of XML is Avid’s Media Composer. Avid helped develop the ‘open’ Advanced Authoring Format, or AAF, and uses that for it’s Project format on disc.","The primary difference between AAF and XML, beyond the fact that they’re representing different data structures, is that AAF is a binary format that is only machine readable, while XML is presented as plain text, which both machines and people can read. (Maybe you too, by the end of this article.)","Both Premiere Pro CC and Resolve will attempt to translate edited timelines between XML and AAF, and are generally successful with simple timelines, but it’s unlikely effects and transitions will be fully compatible."]},{"i":"lets-get-practical","l":"Let’s get practical","p":["We think it helps to have practical examples that introduce the two types of XML we’re interested in: xmeml (Premiere Pro) and fcpxml (Final Cut Pro X). As we work through the examples you’ll learn how to read the XML and learn some of its functionality.","For our example, we’ll be working on extracting a clip’s Keywords from Final Cut Pro X, and extracting a clips Markers from Premiere Pro. These examples are as similar as we could make them.","From both Final Cut Pro X and Premiere Pro you can view XML by exporting an XML file from a Final Cut Pro X Event or Library, or Premiere Pro Project. XML files can be opened in a text editor to view the content. For the best experience reading an XML file, we recommend a text editor that can do “folding” (which allows you to collapse a block of XML between start and end tags into a single line) such as TextWrangler — available for free in the Mac App Store."]},{"i":"finding-a-clips-keywords-in-final-cut-pro-x-xml","l":"Finding a clip’s keywords in Final Cut Pro X XML","p":["2002/60000 is a rational number describing the duration of a single frame as a fraction of a second (literally the seconds-per-frame). The frame rate (in frames-per-second) is actually the inverse of this: 60000/2002 = 29.97002997 frames per second. OK, so it’s 29.97 fps (which is NTSC 30 fps), so why bother with the rational number? Because it’s way more accurate than 30 or even 29.97! (If this was 25 fps PAL footage the frameDuration would be 100/2500s.)","Along the way we’ve learnt about fcpxml Resource information; how to find Keywords and how to calculate frames from Final Cut Pro X’s rational seconds.","Answer from 108,945 frames with a duration of 425 frames and the note “Tell us about Yourself”","Answer from 109,435 with a duration of 760 frames and the note “Tell us about your service background”","At the top of the .fcpxml file is a resources area which has information about media assets, formats, titles/generators/effects, and even multicam and compound clips used in the export. Here’s a trimmed version of the resources area describing this clip:","Here’s a simple example: an interview clip with a Note, and for organization there’s a couple of Keywords on the whole clip and two “Answer” keywords covering part of the interview. In the keyword’s Notes fields there’s some text outlining the question that was asked in this part of the interview. Here’s what it looks like in FCPX’s Event:","Important: The asset element gives us information about the media file: the asset-clip element gives us information about the Clip in Final Cut Pro X Events or Projects.","Interview, Michael from 108,418 frames with a duration of 16,618 frames","it’s been given Camera Name metadata “CLOSE”.","It’s even been given a resource id number and a uid(unique identifier) — just what you’d expect from an app built on a database.","Note: An event would normally contain multiple clips, but we’re keeping it simple.","Note: Each asset — media file — has a block of XML like this one. We’re keeping it to a single clip to make it easier to follow.","Since our goal was to “find a clip’s keywords” we now have the information we need. We have one note on the clip itself - “Wounded Warrior, A Cam” which is not part of our clip’s keywords. The clip’s keywords are:","So we know the media is 1920x1080, but what does that frameDuration number mean?","The asset element has lots of information about the media file:","The asset has been tagged with a format attribute (with its own resource id number), and the format element with id=“r2” is defined later in the resources area. Final Cut Pro X has format definitions for all video formats: a surprisingly large number of them as it turns out.","The asset-clip element has clip information in its attributes: ref links back to the \"r1\" asset and format links back to the \"r2\" format we’ve already seen in the resources area.","The duration attribute is how long the keyword range is: 33269236/60000 x 60000/2002 = 16,618 frames.","the file path is in the src attribute (Note: %20 represents a space in a way that software won’t be confused — technically it’s ‘escaped’ in the same way you would need to for an Internet URL).","The first child element of the asset-clip element is a note and its content is the text in the Notes field.","the media name is in the name attribute","The next 3 elements represent the 4 keywords on the clip. The value attribute is the name of the keyword. Because the keywords “Interview” and “Michael” cover the same range, they are comma-separated the same as they appear in the Event.","The start attribute is where the keyword starts in absolute time: 54263209/15000 = approximately 3.618 seconds. We can convert this to frames by multiplying by the frames per second: 54263209/15000 x 60000/2002 = 108,418 frames.","The two “Answer” keywords both have note attributes which is the text in the keyword’s Notes fields.","Time to look at the clip and its keywords (this is 10.3’s new version 1.6 XML).

We’re going to use the exported .xml to find similar information: the file path to the media file, clip frame rate, clip Log Note and Markers:","The clip frame rate comes from a combination of the timebase and ntsc elements. Combined they tell us 30 frames per second but compliant with NTSC standards. We know it as 29.97 fps.","The clip’s Markers are:","The file path to the media is the content of the pathurl tag, and the frame rate is described in the rate element: timebase at 30 frames per second when ntsc is TRUE means 29.97 fps — or more accurately 30,000/1,001 or 60,000/2,002. (If this was 25 fps PAL footage the timebase would be 25 and ntsc would be FALSE.)","The first frame of the media file is 108,418 because this file has timecode and does not start at zero. We’ve also got information about the number of audio channels and the sample rate of the audio.","The first marker has the name“Interview, Michael” and has in and out elements. These numbers represent the relative number of frames from the beginning of the clip, so the first marker starts at the beginning and has a duration of 16,618 - 0 = 16,618 frames which is the end of the clip (yes, markers can have a duration). The first frame of the clip is 108,418, so that’s the frame number where the marker starts.","The Log Note is in the content of the logginginfo element’s lognote child.","The other two markers have an out of -1 which means they only have a single frame at the in point, and the markers are 527 and 1,017 frames respectively from the start of the clip. Markers can optionally have comment text in the comment element.(If this was XML from Final Cut Pro 7 the markers would also have red/green/blue/alpha elements describing the color of the marker, but PPro actually uses FCP6 XML which does not support colored markers.)","To get to the Log Note and Markers we have to skip over descriptions of the audio tracks until we get to this at the bottom of the clip:","To save space, Premiere Pro exports this full file listing only once. Any other time it appears in the XML is a reference back to the full file listing using the unique id attribute, like this:","We set out to find “the file path to the media file, clip frame rate, clip Log Note and Markers”","Wow, that’s a lot of XML and a lot of repetition, but it’s the same information that’s in the asset and format elements in the .fcpxml file. The main difference is that the numbers represent frame counts rather than rational seconds, which makes the math a lot easier. We’d need the frame rate though to work out the duration in seconds."]},{"l":"Summary","p":["While XML can be strange at first, with a little patience it slowly reveals itself to be the treasure trove of information that it is.

When you develop an application, your project links to one or more frameworks. For example, iPhone application projects link by default to the Foundation, UIKit, and Core Graphics frameworks. Your code accesses the capabilities of a framework through the application programming interface (API), which is published by the framework through its header files. Because the library is dynamically shared, multiple applications can access the framework code and resources simultaneously. The system loads the code and resources of a framework into memory, as needed, and shares the one copy of a resource among all applications."]},{"l":"History Lesson","p":["Phil Pan writes on Alex4D's Facebook Page:","I worked on that team for five years. There wasn't much work done on merging Shake and FCP. Most of the advanced work done by the core Shake team focused on the Helium renderer, which today is core to Pro Apps today. Shake's genius was how it was ultra-efficient as CPU-only code. Management had little interest in Shake and most resources went to Motion and Aperture; projects that Steve could related to when he wasn't completely absorbed by the iPad, the iPhone and the iTunes business ecosystem. The author of this patent, Christophe Souchard, is a French mathematician who had tons of prior experience at Discreet/Autodesk. He joined Apple when it purchased his Senso technology, which was the first Intel-based library to do advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion using motion vector estimation. While at Apple, Christophe's skills impressed management enough that his position was labelled \"Applied Magic\", and a veteran aerospace software engineer was hired to perform curation and clerical code management for his inventions. He introduced the team to methods using partial differential equations and while extremely slow to compute, his next-generation prototypes performed jaw-dropping feats 15 years before similar tools would be introduced by Adobe. None of this work ever came out because Apple had a policy not to release compute-intensive software. Randy Ubillos (father of FCP and close to Steve) wouldn't accept any operation that took longer than a second per frame to render. This relegated Christophe to a research position for a while, until Randy got so impressed that he monopolized Christophe to work on advanced concepts for FCPX. Randy had some clever ideas about shot alignment and automatic editing, and this patent is the result of one of their collaborative projects. Today Christophe works at Unity Technologies doing advanced AR work, and he consults on the side when he has the time. He's recently rumored to have authored the rendering engine for ColorSynth, a complex colour grading plugin for FCPX and Premiere.","Helium was done in Santa Monica by the mad frenchmen team at Apple; Arnaud Hervas, Emmanuel Mogenet and Chrisophe Souchard. Arnaud was the co-founder of Nothing Real, the company that produced Shake. The idea was to do automatic tiled rendering using all available compute resources, so CPU cores and GPU(s). It was a lot trickier than people would think, as math functions would be rounded differently on different resources, and this would affect pixel values. The renderer has to evaluate the render graph to intelligently tile the proper regions-of-interest; i.e. it has to know the size of convolution kernels and all parts of a shader to produce tiles that will later merge properly, and it has to do all of this in real-time. Beautiful work. Emmanuel is now an executive at Google Research in Switzerland. Arnaud is growing tomatoes in Culver City, when he's not working on camera alignment software. Apple could have done a lot more in the high end, but in the last days of Steve, the company shifted its focus on the mass market and mobile devices. It was the right thing to do for all the reasons we know today (the Bottom Line being the most evident), but in so doing it hurt engineering efforts in high-end imaging across the world; Adobe was going through a bad patch and the Discreet team at Autodesk was in disarray. The high-end was picked up by The Foundry: Its founder, Bruno Nicoletti (a Discreet alumnus) had the clever idea to acquire Nuke from Digital Domain and he had the skills and industry knowledge to turn it into the work-horse that it's become today. Still, Nuke is a geek's tool and there could have been an opportunity for a more artist-oriented solution in the high-end. This would not be one of Apple's pursuits: After a couple of years of soul-searching it became clear in 2007 that the future of Apple would be the iPhone and that all the Pro Apps stuff was no longer interesting. It survived nonetheless and I'd say that today the spirit of high(ish) end imaging is coming back to Apple. But so is the case at Adobe. In the end, the consumer wins and it's an exciting time to be buying graphics solutions."]},{"l":"Plugins","p":["Internally, Final Cut Pro supports and contains a number of different plugin types and formats:"]},{"l":"Compressor","p":["Contains CompressorKit.bundle- which can also be found in Compressor and Motion - it's basically the Compressor engine."]},{"l":"FCP-DAL","p":["Contains ACD.plugin- a CoreMediaIO plugin that enables the \"A/V Output\" feature in Final Cut Pro.","The CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) is analogous to CoreAudio’s Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

Let the adventure begin!"]},{"l":"Core Data","p":["Before we dig too deep into the Final Cut Pro library, it's important to understand one of the core technologies Apple uses in Final Cut Pro - Core Data.","Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple in the macOS and iOS operating systems. More than 13 years old now (at the time of writing), Core Data was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and iOS with iPhone SDK 3.0 and like many parts of macOS, Core Data owes much of its design to an earlier NeXT product, Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF).","You can watch the original 2004 WWDC session on Core Data.","You can read Apple's official developer documentation on Core Data.","Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in an application. It provides generalised and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management, including persistence (meaning that, for example, an iPhone App can remember its settings each time the phone is turned off and on again).","It allows data organised by the relational entity–attribute model to be serialised into XML, binary, or SQLite stores. The data can be manipulated using higher level objects representing entities and their relationships. Core Data manages the serialised version.","Core Data can interface directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL - but it's not a SQL wrapper, and offers a much higher level of abstraction. Instead of writing SQL, you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request. However, because Core Data can use SQLite, it's easy to get confused with the differences between SQLite and Core Data. Remember that Core Data isn’t a database. If you want an Object-relational mapping (O/RM) or SQL wrapper, Core Data is not what you want.","Essentially, Core Data is a model layer technology, that's been designed to help programmers do lots of cool stuff, whilst writing less code. It's a toolkit that allows developers to more easily access and manipulate data. For example, it has built-in undo/redo management, allowing developers to add complex undo/redo functionality to their applications with minimum code.","Even though Core Data is a fantastic framework, there are several drawbacks. These drawbacks are directly related to the nature of the framework and how it works.","Core Data can only do its magic because it keeps the object graph it manages in memory. This means that it can only operate on records once they’re in memory. This is very different from performing a SQL query on a database. If you want to delete thousands of records, Core Data first needs to load each record into memory. It goes without saying that this results in memory and performance issues if done incorrectly.","Another important limitation is the threading model of Core Data. The framework expects to be run on a single thread. Fortunately, Core Data has evolved dramatically over the years and the framework has put various solutions in place to make working with Core Data in a multithreaded environment safer and easier.","For applications that need to manage a complex object graph (i.e. Final Cut Pro), Core Data is a great fit."]},{"l":"DeepSkyLite","p":["Final Cut Pro uses a lot of internal Frameworks (see notes about the internal Frameworks).","Within the Flexo Framework, is a framework called DeepSkyLite, which is essentially the \"database engine\" for Final Cut Pro.","Inside the DeepSkyLite Framework is two Compiled Core Data Models:","DSLite_v1.mom","DSLite_v2b1.mom","A .mom file is a binary property list that's NSKeyedArchiver encoded. You can easily open it up in something like BBEdit and have a look, but the easiest and best way to explore a Core Data Model is to just import it back into Xcode.","Here's what Final Cut Pro's model looks like in Xcode:","Patent Screenshot","Interestingly, this model is used for both Final Cut Pro on Mac and Final Cut Pro for iPad."]},{"l":"Reading a DeepSkyLite file","p":["Whilst there are third party tools that can read Core Data database, such as Core Data Lab- unfortunately we can't really use these tools for manipulating Final Cut Pro libraries.","The Core Data Lab developer explains...","To archive and store the mutated data via Core Data, you'll need the same private Apple class.","I'm afraid the only way to mutate the binary data is directly in a SQLite editor.","When using Core Data, your data mutations are validated by the Core Data Object Model. With SQLite you're working low level with nearly no rules, but the end result must still comply to the Core Data Object Model, otherwise the related app can't read the data or crashes.","Loading external libraries is theoretically possible but complicated. I don't know if it is possible in this case, apart from legal issues. Certainly not allowed for apps that you want to sell in the App Store.","So basically, there's no easy way to modify Core Data directly - but because DeepSkyLite is stored in a SQLite store, you can just use regular SQLite tools.","You can still however open them up in Core Data Lab:","You just don't have a lot of easy control to view and modify the binary blobs of data.","However, you can use DB Browser for SQLite to open, read and even manipulate DeepSkyLite data.","However, tread VERY carefully, as it's very easy to make a mistake and corrupt a DeepSkyLite file.","Simply open the .flexolibrary and .fcpevent files from within your from Final Cut Pro Library bundle in DB Browser for SQLite:"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Patents","p":["Alex4D has a great blog post on the Magnetic Timeline patent (Media-editing application with media clips grouping capabilities).","See the actual patent.","Here's one of the screenshots from the patent:"]},{"l":"Patents on Google Patents","p":["...it's a deep rabbit hole, enjoy!","Accelerator handles","Adjustment of color values for optimized image processing","Anchor point in media","Application for designing journals","Applying a Realistic Artistic Texture to Images","Associating keywords to media","Auto stacking of related images","Automatic generation of multi-camera media clips","Boolean Search User Interface","Christophe Souchard","Colleen Pendergast","Color adjustors for color segments","Context aware user interface for image editing","Context based adaptive image resampling","Display of multiple images","Edit to tape","Estimating and removing lens distortion from scenes","Fanning user interface control for medium editing application","Fanning user interface controls for a media editing application","Fast creation of video segments","Here's a small collection of Final Cut Pro related patents:","Import directly into specified folders and user interface","Interactive image thumbnails","Ken Matsuda","Media-editing application with media clips grouping capabilities","Method and apparatus for color correction","Method and apparatus for dynamically resizing windows","Method and interface for converting images to grayscale","Modified media presentation during scrubbing","Navigating Image Presentations","Navigation within a large computer file","Optimizing the Execution of Media Processing Routines Using a List of Routine Identifiers","Previewing effects applicable to digital media content","Producing Smooth Motion Compensated Frames by Combining Multiple Interpolation Results","Publishing Media Content to Virtual Movie Theatres","Randy Ubillos","Regular sampling and presentation of continuous media stream","Retiming media presentations","Rolling shutter distortion correction","Select drag and drop operations on video thumbnails across clip boundaries","Smoothing and/or locking operations in video editing","Spatial and temporal alignment of video sequences","Spatial conform operation for a media-editing application","Split edits","Synchronizing video with audio beats","Techniques for displaying digital images on a display","Two-dimensional timeline display of media items","Unified slider control for modifying multiple image properties","User interface tools for selectively applying effects to image","User interfaces for editing video clips","Video and audio waveform user interface","Video format for digital video recorder","Viewing digital images on a display using a virtual loupe","Viewing digital images using a floating controller","Visual presentation composition","Want to contribute?

These usually include pre-mixed options that will contain a mix of different asset classes, and single sector options such as cash, property and shares.","Most super funds also offer life insurance for their members.","To complicate things slightly, if you want even more control over your superannuation, you can setup a self-managed super fund (SMSF).","There’s no fixed retirement age in Australia – but many people choose to retire when they become eligible for the Age Pension. As of June 2018, the current Age Pension age is 65 and this will rise in stages to 67 in July 2023. If current Government proposals are accepted, the Age Pension age will be 70 by 2035. However, as of today, you can access your super when you turn 65(even if you haven’t retired). On average, most Australian’s can expect around 20ish years of retirement – so by investing money in your superannuation fund, you’re basically (hopefully) putting a whole bunch of money aside, so that when you’re no longer working, you still have money coming in to do fun stuff. The more money you put away when you’re working, the more you’ll be able to spend in your retirement!","It’s your money, so once you’ve turned 65, you can choose to have a regular super income stream(basically, you just keep getting paid a wage, just like when you were working a normal job), you can combine your regular income stream with the Government Pension, or you can take out a lump sum if you’re really game (and make that feature film you always wanted to do as a youngster)!","There are also some very limited circumstances when you can access your super early– mainly related to specific medical conditions or severe financial hardship."]},{"i":"how-do-you-get-paid-super","l":"How Do You Get Paid Super?","p":["At a very basic and fundamental level, if you work for a company or organisation (regardless of whether you’re part time, casual or even a contractor in some cases), are over the age of 18 and earning more than $450 gross a month, then your employer must pay money into a super account in your name, which is then managed by a super fund of your choice (with some exceptions as some industrial awards specify a fund or a choice of a few funds that super must be paid into).","Employees shouldn’t have to really think about the mechanics of how they get paid super – employers should just pay it, after receiving all the correct paperwork. However, employees should have a good understanding of how superannuation works, because it’s their life savings on the line!","For most people, super begins when you start work and your employer starts paying super for you.","If you’re a low or middle-income earner and make personal (after-tax) contributions to your super fund, the government also makes a contribution (called a co-contribution) up to a maximum amount of $500.","is a company director","is a family member working in your business - provided they are eligible for SG.","is a temporary resident - when they leave Australia, they can claim the payments you made through a ‘departing Australia superannuation payment’","is full-time, part-time or casual","It’s slightly confusing, but when talking about casual workers– the Super guarantee is currently calculated at 9.5% of a casual employee’s ordinary time earnings. This includes their wage plus any casual or shift loadings for ordinary hours of work. It also includes commissions and some allowances, but it doesn’t include overtime payments.","receives a super pension or annuity while still working - including those who qualify for the transition-to-retirement measure","Superannuation should never be transferred from one back account to another – it needs to be processing through the proper superannuation channels (normally a clearing house). You need to pay and report super electronically to ensure it meets SuperStream requirements. Super guarantee payments must be made to complying funds or retirement savings accounts by the quarterly due dates, which are 28 days after the end of each quarter. Some super funds require employers to make contributions monthly, and when you register with a fund with this requirement, you are agreeing to make monthly contributions to that fund.","The ATO has a checklist to help you identify what payments are considered salary or wages and whether they are considered part of ordinary time earnings (OTE) for super guarantee purposes.","The formula used is currently 9.5% of your income, including bonuses, commissions and loadings. This is called the Super Guarantee and it’s the law.","To quote Arts Law:","To quote the ATO:","Under the SGC salary or wages have their ordinary meanings, and include payment to a person for work or services by the day, week or month; allowances (but excluding expense reimbursements and allowances and other payments which are fringe benefits); bonuses, commissions and ex gratia payments; overtime and penalty rates; annual leave, long service leave, sick leave and leave loading. Ordinary time earnings means earnings for ordinary hours of work and could include overtime, shift loading or commission.","You can also add extra money to your super account, so that your future self has a better retirement. On that note, to quote the ATO:","You pay super no matter whether the employee:","Your super is your savings for retirement. It is important to be aware of what super accounts you have, how much is being contributed, and what insurance they provide. You can use the myGov service to consolidate superannuation funds– as ideally you only want a single super fund, to keep fees to a minimum."]},{"l":"The Super Dilema","p":["In theory – superannuation should be really simple, but there’s still a lot of confusion surrounding it – especially in the Film & Television world (although it also happens in hospitality& construction too!), where a lot of people in the industry are freelancers and contractors. It’s also slightly more complicated than you might initially think as there’s some additional rules and clauses you need to take into consideration when using standard SPA/MEAA agreements for both cast and crew (explained below).","The Tax Office estimated that in 2014-15 there was a $2.85 billion-a-year shortfall, or a 5.2 per cent gap, in what employers should be paying their employees in super and what was paid.","To quote an SBS article:","Federal Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer says employers deliberately not paying their workers’ super entitlements are “robbing” their staff of wages.","The ATO currently receives 20,000 reports of possible non-payment from employees or former employees per year.","The government is so serious about solving this issue, that they have introduced a new bill which threatens directors with jail-time if they don’t pay their employees super.","So what’s the problem exactly?"]},{"l":"Employee Vs Contractor","p":["Contractors paid mainly for their labour are employees for superannuation guarantee purposes. This is the case even if the contractor quotes an Australian Business Number (ABN).","for their personal labour and skills - which may include physical labour, mental effort or artistic effort - and not to achieve a result","If you employ someone as PAYG(i.e. they get a payslip each pay cycle), and they’re over 18 and earning more than $450 gross a month, then it’s pretty much a no-brainer – they’re an employee and you have to pay them superannuation– there’s no discussion or confusion.","If you make a contract with someone other than the person who’ll actually provide the labour - for example, with a company, trust or a partnership - you don’t pay that person super.","If you need superannuation advice from the ATO, I would suggest completing this form, so that their early engagement team can get back to you promptly.","If you’re unsure, use the tools above, or better yet – contact the ATO– they’re super friendly and super helpful.","Long story short, in MOST cases, if you’re employing a contractor that’s invoicing with a sole trader ABN, if they’re work is “wholly or principally for their labour” (i.e. a gaffer, grip, sound recordist, makeup artist, etc.), and the employee/contractor decision tool and superannuation guarantee eligibility decision tool confirm your suspicions, then you should be paying them superannuation.","The apparent confusion begins when someone is a freelancer or contractor, and is sending a company an invoice from their Sole Trader ABN.","The ATO also has another video discussing “Employee vs Contractor – How to get it right”.","The ATO are on Twitter. They have a Live Chat. They have hundreds of hours of content on YouTube. Even if you don’t like talking to people over the phone – there are plenty of ways to easily communicate with the ATO.","The ATO has a employee/contractor decision tool and a superannuation guarantee eligibility decision tool on their website.","The Australian Government also has an Independent contractors decision tool on their Business website.","to perform the contract work personally - that is, they must not delegate.","To quote the ATO:","under a verbal or written contract that is wholly or principally for their labour - that is, more than half the dollar value of the contract is for their labour","You must make super contributions for these individuals if you pay them:"]},{"l":"PTY LTD Companies","p":["…and with that out of the way, here’s their awesome reply:","(a) a person who is paid to perform or present, or to participate in the performance or presentation of, any music, play, dance, entertainment, sport, display or promotional activity or any similar activity involving the exercise of intellectual, artistic, musical, physical or other personal skills is an employee of the person liable to make the payment;","(b) a person who is paid to provide services in connection with an activity referred to in paragraph (a) is an employee of the person liable to make the payment;","(c) a person who is paid to perform services in, or in connection with, the making of any film, tape or disc or of any television or radio broadcast is an employee of the person liable to make the payment.","A partner in a partnership is not an employee of the partnership.","Administratively Binding Advice","Advice and Guidance","Although there are some Employee or Contractor case studies on the ATO website, there’s nothing on there that’s specific to the Film & Television industry, so I contacted the ATO directly with a simple scenario:","As discussed, please see the below guidance in relation to the status of a worker for the purposes of section 12 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992(‘SGAA 1992’).","As previously outlined in SGR 2005/1 and SGR 2005/2, paragraph 114 of SGR 2009/1 confirms that a Worker who performs services for a Principal via an interposed entity (i.e. a company) is not an employee of the Principal for the purposes of the SGAA 1992.","ATO Legal Database","By contrast, the application of these Rulings and section 12 of the SGAA 1992 to your hypothetical example should be considered general guidance only and is not binding on the Commissioner.","Companies, trusts and partnerships are always contractors. An employee must be a person. If you’ve hired a company, trust or partnership to do the work, then it is a contracting relationship for tax and super purposes. The people who actually do the work may be directors, partners or employees of the contractor but they’re not your employees.","For Pty Ltd Companies add an additional 17.5% - 30% depending on circumstances.","Freelance Promotions, the go-to TVC crewing agency in Melbourne, note on their rate card that:","Higher rates are usually charged by assistants who bill as P/L companies & cover super, insurance & workcover costs.","However, the references to relevant paragraphs of Superannuation Guarantee Rulings SGR 2005/1, SGR 2005/2 and SGR 2009/1 can be relied upon as administratively binding on the Commissioner.","However, this means that if the same sound recordist invoiced via a Sole Trader ABN instead of via their PTY LTD company – they would get paid superannuation – meaning in the long term they get more money – so it’s reasonable and fair for PTY LTD companies to charge more money on their invoice to allow for this – but this is by commercial negotiation.","If a partnership has contracted to provide services, then the person who actually does the work is not the employee of the other party to the contract. This is so even if the worker is a partner and even if the contract requires the partner to do the work. However, if partners contract outside the partnership in their own personal capacity to provide their labour to fulfil a contractual obligation, they can be employees of the other party to the contract.","If a taxpayer remains unsure of their obligations and is seeking binding advice, they are able to apply for administratively binding advice(‘ABA’). Please visit the ATO website and search for Quick Code ‘QC 40439’ for further information.","If a worker is not contracted personally to perform work or services but via an interposed entity such as a company or trust, neither the end-user nor the intermediary is the employer of the worker, because any contract they have is with the interposed entity and not with the worker. The worker may be the employee of the interposed entity.","If the Worker is entitled to payment for the performance of duties as a director of their Company, then the Worker may be an employee of the Company for the purposes of section 12 of the SGAA 1992.","If you are seeking binding advice with respect to the status of a worker for SG purposes, you are able to apply for administratively binding advice (‘ABA’). Please visit the ATO website and search for Quick Code ‘QC 40439’ for further information.","In employment arrangements involving an intermediary firm, a worker and an end-user, more than one contract is often formed. In these arrangements, it is first necessary to determine whether a legal relationship exists for the performance of work and with whom it exists. Only after this has been established can consideration be given to the issue of whether the relationship is one of employment or of some other kind.","In those circumstances, it is not relevant whether the common law factors of employment are present or whether the worker is engaged wholly or principally for labour.","In those circumstances, there is no employer-employee relationship between the Principal and the Worker for the purposes of the SGAA 1992, either at common law or under the extended definition of employee. This is because the Company has entered into an agreement rather than the Worker.","In your hypothetical example, a production company (‘the Principal’) has engaged a sound recordist (‘the Worker’) to perform work for an upcoming television commercial. The Worker has a company (‘the Company’) and the Company invoices the Principal for any work performed. Payments for work performed are made by the Principal to the Company bank account supplied on the invoices.","In your hypothetical example, the legal relationship is evidenced by the invoices supplied by the interposed entity to the end-user for work performed. You have advised that there is no other agreement between the end-user and the Worker.","In your hypothetical example, the production company (‘the end-user’) has contracted with a Company (‘the interposed entity’) and not with the Worker personally, therefore the end-user is not the employer of the Worker.","It is also not relevant whether the worker holds an ABN, as in accordance with paragraph 16 of SGR 2005/1 a person who holds an ABN may still be an employee for the purposes of the SGAA 1992.","It is noted that in many situations sportspersons are engaged via a company or trust, in which case, it will often be the company or trust which is paid so that the sportsperson will play or compete. In such situations due to the interposition of the third party (the company or trust) between the payer and the sportsperson, the result may be that no employment relationship exists under the SGAA between that payer and the sportsperson. However, the sportsperson may be the employee of the intermediary company or trust, depending on the terms of the arrangement.","Let’s say I have a sound recordist in the Film & Television Industry.

This is just plain confusing!","To quote the ATO:","Where an individual performs work for another party through an entity such as a company or trust, there is no employer-employee relationship between the individual and the other party for the purposes of the SGAA, either at common law or under the extended definition of employee.

(The maximum quarterly contribution base amount for the financial year 2009/2010 is $40,170 therefore the maximum contribution assessment amount for any contribution period for the financial year 2009/2010 is $80,340.)","(c) Superannuation contributions must be made on the basis of each employee’s remuneration regardless of any minimum threshold prescribed by the Act.","(d) Superannuation contributions must be paid into the fund each month.","(e) It is the responsibility of the Employer to advise employees upon engagement of their entitlements in accordance with this clause. It is the responsibility of employees to provide details of their fund registration to the Employer or to complete fund registration documents as the case may be.","(f) Where a dispute arises as to the amount of superannuation contributions to be paid and such dispute cannot be resolved between the individual employee and the Employer then this dispute must be referred to authorised representatives of SPAA and MEAA who must endeavour to reach agreement. Should agreement not be reached the matter may be referred to Fair Work Australia in accordance with the terms of clause 39.","(g) Nothing in this clause will reduce any statutory obligation on the Employer to pay superannuation contributions on behalf of an employee under Superannuation Guarantee Legislation.","This means that production companies are required to pay crew superannuation even if they earn less than $450 gross a month. This is really important for entry-level crew who are doing a single day on a television show or feature film, for example. It also means that under the MPPCA, superannuation is paid on contracted hours (including contracted overtime).

Therefore the provision of section 27(1)(a) of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 will not apply to this agreement. In the event that a Producer is not able to make contributions to a superannuation fund on the Artists behalf the Producer will make a payment, equal to the required superannuation contribution identified in clause 40(a), directly to the Artist and will identify the payment on the Artists statement of earnings as a “superannuation payment.”","The ATPA on the other hand states:","(a) In addition to all other payments provided for by this Agreement, the Producer shall make superannuation contributions at a rate of 1% above the minimum superannuation guarantee contribution rate pursuant to the Superannuation Guarantee Legislation to Media Super on behalf of the Performer. Superannuation guarantee contribution rates for Performers will be based on a Performer’s Total Fee.","(b) If the aggregate of the Performer’s Total Fee paid by that Producer to the Performer exceeds $200,000.00 in any one financial year, the Producer will not be obliged to pay a superannuation contribution on the component of the Performer’s Total Fee in excess of $200,000 in that financial year.","(c) Juvenile Artists shall not be entitled to the benefits of this clause unless:","Long story short – with both agreements, even if you’re actor is over 70, you still need to pay them superannuation.

You can also right click on the Console to control what items are displayed (i.e. you may only want to see Effects).","Sometimes you might also want to remove certain things from the console too – such as the Blur Title, because what you REALLY want is the Blur Video Effect.

Once activated, you will see a little notification on your screen saying “ Scrolling Timeline Activated”. Now, if you have your mouse in the timeline area and press spacebar, the timeline will automatically scroll for you! However, if you press spacebar with the mouse outside of the timeline area – the timeline will playback as normal, allowing you to easily switch between the two modes. You can also deactivate the scrolling timeline during playback by pressing the Scrolling Timeline Mode shortcut key again ( CONTROL+OPTION+COMMAND+W). Of course, this shortcut key can always be customised as explained above! If your playhead is not visible when you press play, FCPX Hacks will automatically move your playhead to the middle of the timeline. You can continue to use all your usual shortcuts (i.e. ‘Add Marker’ and ‘Blade’) whilst playing back and the playhead will remain static.","select-lane","You can now Assign Individual Effects, Transitions, Titles & Generators to Keyboard shortcuts via the FCPX Hacks menubar. For example, if you assign a “Directional Blur” to Effects Shortcut 1 via the menu, when you have a clip selected in the Final Cut Pro timeline and press CONTROL+SHIFT+1, it will automatically apply the “Directional Blur” effect to that clip. You can currently assign up to 5 individual effects shortcuts.

I’ve done very little testing outside my own machine, so the script may not work on all systems and configurations.","Download Hammerspoon. It’s free.","Essentially – it’s like a more powerful and geekier version of Automator, and allows you to script a bunch of stuff to speed up everyday tasks. For example, you could write a script that changes which wireless access point you’re connected to with a click of a button, or have an alert pop up on your screen when a render is finished. There’s lots of examples here.","Hammerspoon comes as a ZIP file. Unzip it and drag the Hammerspoon.app to your Applications folder.","hammerspoon-01","hammerspoon-02","hammerspoon-03","hammerspoon-04","hammerspoon-05","I’ve noticed that the script can get very sluggish when you have lots (i.e. more than 500) clips in your event – whereas it’s really quick and snappy with events that only 50-100 clips. This seems to be a limitation of AppleScript, which I’ve been unable to solve thus far (if anyone has any ideas, please let me know!).","I’ve tried to code it so it works with all the common window layouts, however I’ve only tested it with FCPX 10.2.3 and macOS 10.11.6 on a MacBook Pro and a 5K iMac – so it MAY not work well on other systems. If it doesn’t work for you – let me know in the comments below.","If it doesn’t work for some reason, the Hammerspoon application has a Console ( COMMAND + R) which displays any error messages. If things don’t work as expected, let us know in the comments below so that we can fix things up.","If you want to test it out, here’s how:","It uses the Lua scripting language– which I’ve never used before, but it seemed simple enough.","It’s also free, and open source. Bonus!","Now when you open Hammerspoon it should load the script, ready to rock and roll!","One of the original ideas that Scott Simmons suggested was to somehow highlight the playhead position in the browser. My idea was to do this with a GIANT arrow, so the editor can instantly see where the playhead is. Despite a lot of Googling, I couldn’t work out how to do this with AppleScript or Automator, and I don’t have the time (or the skills) to jump into Xcode. Luckily however I discovered something called Hammerspoon.","Out of the box, Hammerspoon does nothing. What you need to do now is feed it some code!","Over the last few days, I’ve been having lots of discussions with other Final Cut Pro users on social media about how annoying the Reveal in Browser(aka ‘Match Frame’) feature in FCPX is. The problem is that if you have hundreds of clips within your browser, when you match frame it’s really hard to instantly visually see where the playhead is in a sea of other clips. It’s also really annoying if you’ve got your playhead at a specific position in the browser, then continue editing in the timeline for a hour or so, and want to easily jump back to that browser playhead position to continue where you left off. It’s VERY hard to spot which clip is selected and where the tiny white playhead is hiding in the browser!","So let’s Quit Hammerspoon for now.","So, with a LOT of trial and error, playing with my new favourite tool UI Browser, reading through heaps of examples, some helpful Tweets, and AMAZING support from the Hammerspoon team – I was able to throw something together that seems to work!","That’s it! Hopefully it works for you and you find it useful. If it doesn’t work for you, or if you have any ideas, comments or suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments below. Happy Cutting!","This will open the hidden Hammerspoon folder, where you need to drop in the previously downloaded init.lua file and hs folder.","This will open the Security & Privacy system preferences. You’ll need to unlock the panel by clicking the paddock in the left hand corner of the screen, and enter in your computers password. Once the panel is unlocked, you’ll need to make sure the Hammerspoon item is ticked as per below. Once done, you can now close this window.","To actually function properly, Hammerspoon needs Accessibility permissions. Click the Enable Accessibility button.","To quote the manual: “At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine. What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user”.","To try and solve this, I quickly threw together a simple little AppleScript that uses the macOS Accessibility API to find out where the browsers playhead currently is, and then instantly move the mouse cursor to the playhead position. It was a bit of a hack job, but after a bit of experimenting, it finally worked. However, as many people commented, it’s a pretty bad idea to move the mouse as it breaks all the Apple Human Interface Guidelines. After playing with it for a while, I have to agree – it’s a bit strange having the mouse move on you!","We now need to move the downloaded init.lua and hs folder to ~/.hammerspoon/. The easiest way to do this is click Go > Go To Folder from the menubar in Finder (or press COMMAND + SHIFT + G from the desktop).","What I discovered is that Hammerspoon has the ability to not only handle AppleScript (so I could reuse the code I’ve already been playing with), but it can also draw things on the screen – which is exactly what I needed.","When you press CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + F it will perform a normal match frame in FCPX, but will also draw a red circle around the browser playhead temporarily so you can easily see where the playhead is.","When you press CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + H it will draw a red circle around the browser playhead (without doing a match frame). This is helpful if you’re just working in the browser, but you’ve ‘misplaced’ where the playhead currently is.","When you press CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + S it will perform a normal match frame, but it will also take the name from the clip you are match framing, and apply it to the search tool, so that only the match frame clip appears in your browser. I call this a “Single Match Frame”.","You can download the latest script at the top of this page (I’ll be constantly updating this link as I slowly improve the script based on your feedback). This also comes as a ZIP. When you unzip it, you’ll find a file called init.lua and a folder called hs. This is what we need to give to Hammerspoon. The file is just a plain text file, so you can open it up in TextEdit (or my preference BBEdit) if you want to check out the code. The hs folder contains some additional Hammerscript modules not written by me.","You can now launch FCPX and see if it works by trying to match frame something ( CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + F).","You can now run Hammerspoon. The first time you run it you’ll be presented with a Preferences panel:","You’ll then be presented with a dialogue box, where you need to type ~/.hammerspoon/.","You’ll then be presented with a Security window like the below. Click Open System Preferences.","You’re also MORE than welcome to modify the script for your own needs (or fix my poorly designed code). I’ve been experimenting with it for saving/restoring FCPX window layouts, and also trying to implement a scrolling timeline – so there’s definitely some cool stuff you can do with it!

It had me at “The”. Terry Pratchett is one of my favourite authors and it delighted me so to read a script that was very much in a similar vein. It was so absurdly funny it had me laughing so hard I almost wet myself.","As an actor you generally have no control over the people you end up working with on a show. You rock up hoping that at least one person is nice and will let you sit with them at lunch. I really lucked out on Wizards. Everyone was lovely. And so bloody good at what they did! But even in the most encouraging environments there are always challenges.","But I digress. Watching all of Michael’s online content was super handy in giving me a pretty good idea of his style and what the look, feel, pacing & tone for Wizards would most probably be like.","Geez… I’ve really waffled on haven’t I? Okay I’ll stop now.","How I came to be involved in Wizards was one of those rare worlds-aligning-stars-colliding-Tom-Hanks-Meg-Ryan scenarios. By that, I mean I got sent an email. From someone I’d never met. Asking if I’d like to be part of their show.","I don’t know about other people but I have this annoying habit of getting part way through a gig then suddenly having a crisis of confidence that I’m not doing a good enough job.","I had never worked with Michael or anyone else from the LateNite team so I had absolutely no idea what it was going to be like. So the first thing I did was Google the shit out of them.","I know all actors go about their actoring differently but I find the more prepared I am before a shoot the happier I am with the outcome (and the more fun I have). So I rehearsed & work-shopped independently and walked to set with my shoes full of feet and my head full of ideas. It took away the stress of shooting to such a tight schedule because I felt match fit & ready to play.","If you ever get the chance to work with the LateNite team, DO IT you lucky son of a bitch. You’ll never meet a more talented bunch of nutjobs. Especially that Michael guy. He’s a little bit magic.","In today’s blog post, we have yet another very special guest. Best known for her role as Priya Kapoor on iconic Network Ten television series Neighbours, Menik Gooneratne has had a film and television career spanning over a decade, encompassing both Australian and international productions, including working with Nicole Kidman on the upcoming feature Lion. Today she talks to us about her experiences on The Wizards of Aus. Enjoy!","Limited time was one major challenge. With so much to shoot Wizards moved at a lightning pace. My first day was a baptism of fire. We were running so behind on the shots that when the time to shoot my scenes we had less than an hour of daylight left. Great. So not only were there the usual “Don’t fuck it up Menik” first day nerves there were the additional “Oh shit, no really, there’s no time to fuck up so don’t….crap how do I walk in a straight line again?” nerves too.","My audition consisted of a chat over coffee with Michael. He even paid. Nice lad. And then I was left to my own devices to prepare. We didn’t have the opportunity for a rehearsal period, which meant the next time I saw everyone was my first day on set.","My favourite days of filming were when we shot the Town Hall stuff - epic group scenes with lots of insane characters and lots of ridiculously funny comedians playing said insane characters. I watched as one after the other these guys and gals just slayed it & had us all in hysterics.","My third tip is – DON’T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.","Oh! One more thing.","Okay, I lie. I DID wet myself….I’ve had a baby so unfortunately this seems to be a thing I do now.","So my love of Terry Pratchett and weak lady muscles aside, I found the script irresistibly zany. I thought the manner in which it commented on Australia’s attitudes toward immigration very very clever. I loved the character of Kylie and what she stood for. I could relate to her on a number of levels. So right from the beginning this production felt like the perfect fit for me (shall I be douchey and call it Fate? Yes, yes I will). It was fate.","So my second first bit of advice is – DO YOUR RESEARCH.","Thankfully my bladder held out on this occasion but it got me worried about how unfunny my contribution thus far had been. Luckily that feeling didn’t last but it made me realise that often as an actor when you land a good role you just feel so freaking grateful they picked you, that you forget it’s a two way street. They didn’t hand you the role out of pity – you got it because you had a quality that no one else had. So boys & girls, don’t be a dingus like me and compare yourself to your cast mates – be true to your flavour and trust that your qualities are essential to the mix.","That being said Wizards was an incredibly easy production to be involved in because Michael was a dream director. He had such a precise vision of what he wanted, and such a clear way of articulating it, that it made my job easy. Even amongst the chaos of directing & starring & commandeering the whole show, he still made the time to bounce ideas with me & talk things through which made the whole experience so wonderfully collaborative.","That brings me to my second tip – BE PREPARED.","That’s my first bit of advice for you – FOR THE LOVE OF DRY CLOTHING DO YOUR PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES.","The Internet is amazing. Do be careful of what search words you type in though. My first google search of “Late Nite Shanks” led me to believe I was embarking on some sort of homage to nocturnal meat consumption…","What?

This was a joint effort by the three of us as we weaved in and around each other to shave his hair, apply a man bun hair extension and then cover him in tattoos, dirt, grime and the occasional random chunk of inexplicable goo for no other reason than fun.","Our real challenge, however, lay in the extended cast of riff raff; 5 gruesome goblins, 2 more wizards, an orc, an elf, a necromancer, a mummy, a witch and a fortune teller to name a few. For these big days foam, gelatine and silicone prosthetic pieces were all pre painted to 95% and along with false teeth, lenses, lashes, beards, moustaches and wigs, all prepped and ready for the many extra hands to assist on the day.

We didn’t have the budget or the manpower to use large daylight sources. As a result, from day one I briefed my lighting department to make sure I had a key light 90 degrees from camera and a back edge at all times; so as I was blocking the scene with Michael and Daniel Daperis (1st Assistant Director), my lighting boys were moving 12×12 frames into place to achieve this. They poured their hearts and souls into this, managing to always keep us a step ahead.","As you will see in the series there is a lot of camera movement so it was important to have the Red Dragon as light and slim as possible. This limited us on what we could have on the camera to keep weight down.","Gremsy H14 Stabilizer with an Easyrig","Hell, yeah!!","How about it, Benny boy? Up for the challenge?","I fell into a trap of trying to rack focus too close in the shot as we pan. I found I was pulling too close, and keep in mind at this point the camera is tracking back, so focus was coming up short. I thought there is no real reference in the shot for focus when the camera was panning so quickly around. I left the focus longer and almost didn’t adjust anything. Because by that stage we were at a similar distance as we were tracking in, so I was able to judge it from there. After that the shot became easier each take.","I thoroughly enjoyed shooting this and will be forever grateful to everyone involved, four weeks of laughs and hard work with friends I love…challenge met.","I want to breakdown at least one shot that was difficult for focus. One in particular that stands out for me is when we are introduced at the start of the scene to Jack sitting in his car stuck in traffic trying to get to his interview. The camera is on the dolly for this particular setup and we are on a 85mm lens. The shot starts by tracking into the side mirror into a close-up of Jack in the reflection sitting in the front seat. Suddenly the camera quickly pans around as we pass the mirror into a close-up of Jack. From there the camera continues to track back into a mid-shot.","I’ve worked with Michael once before on a 48hr short film entitled The Script Machine which he co-directed with another of our producers, Nicolas Colla. That shoot was a unique experience, and I’ve been looking forward to working with him ever since. It was exciting being his eyes on Wizards. Having that many roles in a production can be overwhelming to most people, but not to Michael. His capacity to jump from an actor’s to an editor’s to a VFX’s head space as needed didn’t seem to faze him at all. He had a clear and concrete idea of what he was trying to achieve, but was still open to suggestions and new or different ways of going about it; all this while making jokes and maintaining a great atmosphere on set.","In this blog post we have two very special guests – first up is longtime collaborator and close friend, our amazing Director of Photography on The Wizards of Aus, the awesome Benjamin Hidalgo De la Barrera, followed by his trusty 1st Camera Assistant, the incredibly hardworking Jonathan Haynes. Enjoy!","It is always a challenge with gimbal shots for focus, but I like a bit of a challenge. It was pretty free flowing at times and especially with the battle stuff. I think as an AC it is super important to drop marks for actors and get focus marks where possible. I would always give the actors a mark and give Ben a starting position for the camera. By doing that I knew the rough focus distance to go off, and at times I would only get one or two marks and then just go wherever the shot took me. Ben was great to work with in that respect. The communication between us was really strong and I think it helped enormously during the shoot.","Most steadi-cam and Gimbal setups usually have as much focus tools as possible on them such as a Cinetape, monitors and a wireless motors for focus, iris and zoom. I didn’t have access to a Cinetape and we were using Primes (Zeiss CP.2’s). I only had one focus motor on the camera and Ben was able to adjust his own stops with ease. As I said there was a lot of camera movement, Ben chose to mainly shoot around T4’s and I think he mainly did this to help me in focus land. In all honesty the shots still looked great regardless of them being at T4. I think the decision to not shoot everything wide open on the lens complements the series as there was a lot going on in the backgrounds of shots most of the time, so there was no need for the backgrounds to be soft.","My name is Jonathan Haynes and I worked as the 1st Assistant Camera on The Wizards of Aus.","On the series the following equipment was used:","One challenge for me during pre-production, while working with the Gremsy H14 Stabilizer was, I didn’t want to limit the decision making of Michael Shanks (Director & Main Character) and Benjamin Hidalgo De la Barrera (DOP). As some scenes worked better on the dolly rather than on the Gremsy, it was important to be able to change from fly mode setup into production setup fairly quickly so the guys would have the freedom to choose what setup they wanted without any worry of time constraints or long build times.","Red Dragon","RT Motion wireless follow focus","Shooting The Wizards of Aus has been one of the most challenging jobs I’ve had.","So to start with it was hard to fine-tune anything properly until the move was solid. I find with difficult shots like this, the more rehearsals or more takes you do, in quick intervals, the team (Camera Operator, Key Grip and 1st AC) becomes in sync and the timing is much much better. I find if there are long pauses in-between takes everyone loses their rhythm a bit and it can take a moment to get it right again.","Teradek Bolt transmitter and receiver","The other reason was, for example when we shot the castle battle scenes we mainly had overcast shooting conditions but the sun did pop out a little or it got darker. Ben would either stop down or open up to compensate for sun or cloud. He didn’t trap himself in shooting wide open (T2.1) and then having to constantly waste time on changing ND filters. I can’t stress enough there was really no time for that and Ben knew that. It was only myself and Ben in the camera team for majority of the shoot, so speed was critical for us as a team.","This shot wasn’t a heavy performance shot but it was definitely more of a technical shot for the camera and grip crew. This shot took us around seven to eight takes to get a few good options for the edit. It took the team a number of tries to become in sync and get timing right. That was one challenge for me as initially the camera movement would be different each take.","We had the same basic approach concerning camera work. My 1st Assistant Camera, Jono Haynes, was paramount in accomplishing this. After we shot a couple of scenes and had had considerable discussions regarding style, he was fully adept at what lenses Michael and I would want for coverage, which meant the camera was always ready and standing by. I can’t stress how important Jono’s work was and how valuable an asset he was to the production, always keeping images sharp without rehearsals. His flexibility and adaptability during production allowed us to pull it off. We could have never done it without him.","We needed to be able to move fast, whilst still obtaining high-end images. After testing different rigs, we chose to shoot on the Red Dragon with Compact Primes on a Gremsy (supplied by Flying Dragon) which was then mounted on an Easy Rig. This allowed us to move fast as far as coverage was concerned. We also had a dolly and track for a few shots when we used our zoom lens, which also played on sticks from time to time.","When it came to interiors, everything was lit. I like moody lighting and contrast and my camera on the dark side of my actors’ faces, which in low-budget circumstances can be difficult to attain. We placed sources where required, and once the desired lighting diagram was completed we began playing with temperatures and levels. Once we captured a few interior scenes along with lengthy conversations on what I was trying to achieve, my lighting boys were able to anticipate what I’d ask of them as I was blocking the scene.","When Series Producer Chris Hocking first approached me, he laid out the basic plot, explaining this was essentially a Lord of the Rings parody and production values needed to be high. This had to look like an epic high-budget production; except they had millions of dollars and we only had a few hundred grand; they had years to film, and we only had a little under four weeks to shoot six 15-minute episodes. Such an ambitious project, so much coverage, so little time….","With these rigs in my experience they are still fairly heavy and awkward even with an Easyrig. So I decided to make up a docking station, with the help of The Vision House guys, so Ben could rest the camera when he felt like it. The other good advantage of the docking station was that we could rest it on the stand so Ben was able to light the scene without having to hold the rig and keep frame.","Zeiss Compact Primes (set of 5 lenses)","Zeiss Compact Zoom 70-200m"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Writing The Wizards of Aus","p":["01_reporters","02_boards","03_goblin","04_townhall","05_townhall2","06_goblins","Ah, geez Nick!","As a result of all that writing, Wizards as it is now is nothing like it originally was. Shank’s original concept for Wizards was about an immigrant wizard called Jack who moved to Melbourne, followed by his hitherto unnamed dark wizard nemesis. That stuff all made the final script (the dark wizard eventually got fleshed out to become Skullrich), but it served us as a pretty solid, very barebones basis for the series. The best decision we ever made when structuring and fleshing out the narrative and world of the show was this: Magic has no rules, so neither should we.","As a result, every beanbag with a camera, half a joke and no money thinks they’ve got the next ‘We are Spinal-Tap’ on their hands. But for every ‘The Office’ out there, there are twenty thousand garbage mockumentaries floating around the deepest doldrums of YouTube, that’d put any first year student film to shame. I quickly convinced Shanks that a more classical narrative style would suit the show better; it didn’t take a lot of work to be honest. We were on the same page about Wizards very early on.","Bruce was playing Regimand, Jack’s pervy, painting-bound, wizard father. A line wasn’t really working, a sleazy pick up line. I spent an hour, sitting alone on set scribbling down any vaguely funny, vaguely magical sounding pick up line. Finally I hit gold - a gross line regarding the nature of mermaids. I pitched it to Shanks. He wouldn’t stop laughing. He pitched it to Bruce, who justifiably shot it down - “I’m not going to say that”. I had instantaneously alienated an actor who I was incredibly excited to work with, and whose work I greatly respect.","From there on I stayed on the project in a number of other roles for the entirety of production. I worked on preproduction planning the show, designing the characters and helping out art department. I was on set making up alternate lines, or running errands or royally fucking up the second unit green screen footage. I acted with Guy Pearce, and creeped him out with awkward small talk behind the scenes. I spat sugar in a very nice young woman’s face whilst dressed as a mummy. In post I even animated some 80s style lightning effects. However, on the final, final day of shooting - a pick up day with actor Bruce Spence - I stepped back into the role of writer, with hilarious, disastrous results.","Hello there.","I am incredibly proud of The Wizards of Aus. I’m proud of the work I did. I’m proud of what I’ve accomplished as a writer. I’m proud of Michael Shanks. I’m proud of the entire team. But most important of all, I got the opportunity to work with a massive cast and crew of incredibly talented people, many of whom I am proud to now consider my friends, nay, family… apart from Guy and Bruce… I really, really creeped them out…","I’d take the scripts away, do a pass on them, change what I thought didn’t work or wasn’t funny, send it to Shanks who would do the same (and change a lot of it back). Then we’d come together to write again, argue for several hours about why the changes we’d each made or not made were important and had to stay, suck each other off about how funny we both are. Then we’d write, maybe get drunk sometimes, watch ‘Legend’ for some reason (not helpful). In the final days of writing we’d drag ourselves to the writing room, write, contract scurvy, then make our final, valiant assault on the writing. Somehow we’d got it all done, in a very narrow window, and were also still friends. I don’t know how we did it, but in my own, modest opinion, it’s probably because we’re both monumental geniuses.","Living the dream, folks!","My name is Nick Issell, and I’m a screen writer. Feel free to be adequately impressed… Oh, you’re not impressed at all? That seems about adequate to me. Anyway…","Secondly, we began work on Wizards in December of 2014. A month earlier, What we do in the Shadows had been released; a mockumentary comedy about a specific supernatural species, set in a predominantly white, southern hemisphere nation. If we had have stuck to the mockumentary style, comparisons were bound to have been made. Hell, if some director in South Africa had have made a movie about… oh, I dunno, aliens or something… with a similar framing device, we’d have been in real hot water. But the foremost for problem, for me at least, was the risk of mockumentary - a philosophy that Shanks and I share. Mockumentaries are inherently risky, not because they’re hard to make, but because they seem to be easy.","Shank’s original concept way back when, up until we sat down for our first series brainstorming session, was that the show would be in the mockumentary style. This was another reason for me to be wary, for a number of reasons. Firstly, we had just written and shot a mockumentary short together called ‘Keeping up with the Comstocks’. As far as I was concerned we had had a crack at the medium, and were now done and dusted. I really had no interest or inclination to try it again.","The final episode went through a number of iterations. We even had a lot of really great, really funny stuff on the cards that eventually had to be scrapped - a really funny beach cricket sequence amongst them that I was sad to see go - before we finally settled on the ‘Town Hall Scene’, a sequence that can only be described as our spin on the final episode of ‘Seinfeld’. It works and it’s funny, but no matter how you cut it, it always hurts to kill your darlings.","The series actually came together quite easily. Episodes quickly fell into place. Jack goes on a particularly boring adventure - applying for a recycling bin, speed dating, getting stuck in traffic, etc… – which is then quickly livened up with any number of supernatural shenanigans and magical characters. What we struggled with was how to end it. We had set up quite a bit of underlying real world politics, namely the asylum seeker debate, in the form of a fictional vote to decide if Wizards were allowed to stay in Australia. We knew that we had to bring all that to a head in the conclusion but, contrary to popular belief, heavy political issues turn out to not be that funny.","The Wizards of Aus was written under very strange, high pressure conditions. When the original pitch went ahead none of the episodes had yet been written. We were fully approved for funding and a hard month or so was allotted for us to write all six episodes. How we did this, I’ll never truly know. It was a fun, feverish, creative blur. We spent many hot days and long nights locked away in the dungeon that is Michael’s weird, tiny office - a task made infinitely easier by the fact that we lived in the same apartment complex at the time. We wrote together, drank coffee, wrote, watched the ‘Lord of the Rings’ trilogy (helpful), then wrote some more.","We wrote literally whatever we wanted. We basically wrote a cartoon, but for live action – a dream for us as creatives, but a nightmare for our producers, I’m sure. As a result, when I walked in and said I wanted to write in a giant eyeball king, or a regency era, Mister Darcy-esc Mummy, or a bing-bang-bog head of a dog, it went in. When Shanks wanted to devote an entire episode to a hitherto unseen Baby Bones, it went in. When we decided that we needed horses to eat quiche whilst sat at a kitchen table like a human - something no one believed would be budgetarily feasible, let alone a position a living horse could physically contort into - IT BLOODY WENT IN!","When my best buddy-boy, Michael Shanks, approached me to co-write The Wizards of Aus with him, I’ll admit, I was a little wary of the idea. The Wizards of Aus was Shanks’ baby and I was tentative to get involved. He’d been throwing around ideas for ‘the wizard thing’ (that was the concept’s profoundly creative working title) for many years. By this point I had been working with Shanks since year 11 - we’d written a number of scripts together (all lost to time, thankful), and I had been present for every episode of Doomsday Arcade. In fact, it was maybe only a few short months after Doomsday finally wrapped, that the Wizards concept first popped from Shank’s fertile brow (yuck). He even shot a few scenes. I played a Spinning Wizard. It was pretty shitty, but even so I was pretty daunted by the idea of meddling with a concept Shanks still clearly held so dear. I also wasn’t particularly interested in working on something I’d have no ownership or claim over - a glorified punch up writer. Thankfully, I was wrong to have such misgivings, and so I signed on for a job that has probably been the best one I’ve ever had."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Producing The Wizards of Aus","p":["…and of course a man made entirely of butter, aptly named Butterman.","01_nick_on_phone","02_michael","03_chris","04_smoke 05_goats","06_shanks","07_rennie_eve","08_knights","09_dream_team","1.

It also meant when it rained that rather than buy umbrella’s we grabbed whatever was lying around as demonstrated by series producer Chris Hocking below…","around 5-6 fully working puppets which include a half man half shark and a baby made of bones","Every single department went above and beyond to make this show happen and all walked away with smiles on their faces at the end of each day. We were also very lucky to be able to put together a crew that had a mixture of on set experience. We had people like the incredible Marie Kealy who has worked on The Hobbit and then on the flip side of that we had our Production Designer Rennie Watson and Costume Designer Paige Prendergast, who, although having a billion projects under their collective belts, had never tackled a long form project before, and certainly not something of this scale. The other thing that made this work was the sense of family that was created amongst everybody and the idea that this was all a project that we loved so we would band together when the shoot got tough. We honestly couldn’t have done it without every single one of them by our side.","I’ve heard a rumour that Robert DeNiro won’t work with a director until he’s had them around for dinner, the thought process behind this being that he wouldn’t work with someone that he couldn’t sit through a meal with. Whether it’s true or not I like the idea behind this. My biggest advice to any producer or director for that matter is to only work with people who are not only talented but who are also great people. We have a silent ‘No Dickhead’ policy in at LateNite and I am 100% sure it’s this little silent rule that has allowed us to make this show exactly the way that Shanks wanted.","Nothing is impossible.","Now before I go any further I should point out that although this was definitely “low budget” we still had a little bit of money to play with. When we say low budget we mean low for what we set out to achieve, not low as in we bought everyone fish and chips as a thank you for volunteering for the month long shoot. But for the sake of getting your heads in the right frame of mind I will tell you that we were quite a way under the half a million mark so hopefully that gives you a bit more of an idea.","scenes demanding scores of extras","Screen Australia have approached me to see if I want to do a web series. And I’m thinking we could do this wizard thing I’ve been kicking around for 5 or 6 years.","Since Hocking & I have started working together, we’ve never really had any money to make a project. We’ve never crowd funded, we’ve never had any government funding and we’ve certainly never had any private investment or the like. There are pro’s and con’s with not having money to make a project but the biggest pro for me is that it’s always taught Hocking and I to be resourceful, and if there was a project that ever desperately needed that skill it was this one. A show like this can’t be produced in the same way you’d be taught to produce at film school. It requires you to think outside the box and try and nut out how to get what the director want’s with the money you have. This doesn’t just extend to the producing department however. From the get go we made sure that every department was aware at what we were trying to achieve and we gave everybody an out. We basically said something along the lines of:","So an extremely talented director (Michael Shanks for those playing at home) that you’ve been working with for a very long time comes to you and says:","So in order to make this an efficient insight into producing on a low budget I’m gonna break this down into 5 simple thoughts, in no particular order of importance…","So this is where you have a choice.","So with that I offer you the following advice:","So you spend the next few weeks working on a submission, watching from a distance as the director & his co-writer (Nick Issell) throw ideas around that get bigger, and bigger and bigger. And finally you’re presented with a document that outlines the series and includes the following:","Sweet. Sounds like fun. I’m in.","talking horses","The choice is you can either turn to the very talented director and his equally talented co-writer and say, sorry lads – there is no fucking way we can do this OR you can listen to the advice of our Series Producer, the Gentleman Workhorse that is Chris Hocking, and you can say the following:","The number one rule for us as a production company has always been to work with people that are not only insanely talented, but who are also just gosh darn wonderful human beings. Filmmaking is a bloody hard endeavour at the best of times and when you’re taking on a project such as Wizards as your first long form project then you better hope that you’ve got an army of people behind you ready to support you no matter what. And we were lucky enough to have just that.","The reaction in your head is a little different this time around. It’s a little more like this:","There are always going to be times when things get shit. Locations will fall out. Cast will become unavailable. Money will become tight. Crew & Cast will get weary due to the long days and having to do the jobs they would normally have 5 more people for. Weather will become shit. Things will be forgotten. I could go on and on. The important thing for us to remember was always that we were turning up on set every day and playing the best kind of make believe. Every day we were doing something different whether it be goblins and knights having a full scale battle, baby bones puppets eating cats before diving into floor boards or filming a 1000 year old mummy speed dating. Couple that with a funny, supportive, caring and all round amazing cast & crew and you really have nothing to complain about.","There are times when things are going to get tough and you’re gonna have to make shit decisions. In pre production, Shanks and Nick Issell had to make sacrifices at script stage in order for us to be able to make the show within budget. We also had to make some hard and fast rules about what we could afford on the budget that we had. Things like using a Gremsy instead of a Steadicam for most of the production as it was always going to be cheaper and meant one less crew member to pay. It also gave us the ability to move quickly which was imperative as Shanks is the kind of director that shoots A LOT of set ups.","Think big, take risks, do whatever it takes to get it done and always ALWAYS work with legends.","We wanted to make sure that all of the money for Wizards went on screen which meant when it came to selecting our crew, we had to work out the essentials for each department and work out how many jobs we could take on board between the core production crew. This included in post production where Shanks & Hocking almost single handedly tackled the edit, VFX and music composition. Even down to things like making deliverables for SBS, post production scripts etc, etc. Things that you’d normally outsource were taken on board to save money. It was no different in production where myself, Sumah & Chris juggled multiple jobs to make the production work and to save ourselves money. During Pre and Production the three of us juggled the jobs of 10-15 people with us having to look after things like scheduling, accounting, unit base, 2nd & 3rd assistant directing, line producing, driving between Melbourne and Kryal castle to grab catering each day, legals… even down to assisting on set in the camera, lighting, make up, costume and art departments as demonstrated by series producer Chris Hocking below on the smoke machine and me on goat wrangling duty.","We’ll warn you from the get go – the scripts are insane and it’s going to be a difficult shoot BUT what we can promise you is that it will be a hell of a lot of fun and we’ll support you in any way we can. That said don’t feel obliged as we know what we’re asking is huge.","When it came to locations it was settling for what we could afford and most of the time it meant going with the location that we had a personal connection to (ie knew someone that worked there). And of course there were the really tough days during production where Shanks had to sacrifice some of his shot list because of time. Every day was a race to the finish line so Shanks, along with our 1st AD Dan had to be on the ball making sure that we were getting the minimum of what we needed before moving onto the “if we have time shots”. It wasn’t always pretty but our ability to make decisions collectively as a team meant we always got it done.","Your immediate reaction is of course:"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"year-in-review-2015---part-2","l":"Year in Review 2015 - Part 2","p":["If you haven’t already, check out Part 1 here."]},{"l":"JULY","p":["So I’m gonna cheat a little bit here because I totally left this out of my May releases and it is close to being my favourite film of 2015.

What I did learn from Tony is the importance of blocking when it comes to shooting quickly and, when your back is up against the wall and you’re running out of time, how important it is to be able to use that blocking to make your coverage efficient.","And whilst all this was going on…you guessed it.

The early stages of having conversations with crew, mulling over scripts and generally freaking out any time Shanks & his co-writer Nick Issell came back with episode revisions that were bigger and more epic than the last incarnation!","01_flickerfest","Whilst that was going on we also had our short films Palindromes& Rocketman screening at the prestigious Flickerfest in Sydney and of course Shanks still found some time to knock out this wee little gem:"]},{"l":"FEBRUARY","p":["So aside from the fact that the script was full of plot holes, Samuel L Jackson’s character having a really bizarre lisp and a weird anal joke at the end of the film – Kingsman kicked some serious arse. It was explosive, fun, beautifully executed and far from what anyone I think was expecting. It was also another tick in the very slick cannon of Matthew Vaughn films.","So whilst pre-production was still motoring along on Wizards, Palindromes managed to screen at the Peninsula Film Festival out in Rosebud which is run by Australian actor Steve Bastoni. A very cool young outdoor festival (like Melbourne’s version of Tropfest), the film was screened to over 4,000 people and we managed to take our second runner up for Best Short Film.","02_peninsula","And shortly after that Hocking, Shanks and myself jumped on different planes and headed over to the US of A…"]},{"l":"MARCH","p":["Now this wasn’t necessarily my favourite film of this month HOWEVER it was one of my favourite trailers (Hugh Jackman with a mullet – SHIT YES!) and it was also a film I got to see in LA with Shanks, Hocking and a host of other friends at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. So it’s a little sentimental which is nice.","Anyway March was a crazy month cause not only did we spend 2-3 weeks over in the US, we also started production on Wizards when we returned. So whilst over in LA, Hocking (who actually only stayed in the US for three nights) was constantly on the phone with our lawyers, accountant, Screen Australia and the team back in Melbourne, whilst Shanks was working on storyboards and having similar conversations with our head of departments. The US was a whirlwind trip but to give you a bit of an idea, Shanks spent the time having meetings at ridiculous studios and production companies (HE VISITED BAD ROBOT FOR GOD SAKE) whilst we were there supporting a bunch of our shorts that were doing quite well on the festival circuit.","03_bad_robot","Again, Palindromes screened at the Academy Award accredited Cinequest in San Jose, our 48 Hour Film Festival short Wrong Way Right was screening at the International 48 in LA and on top of that we paid a little visit to the Fox studio lot to watch our award winning short Terarrial screen in one of the screening rooms at Fox.","ON TOP OF THIS (bare with me) we also shot our very first Wizards scene with Shanks behind the camera and Chris on sound, shooting a scene with our good friend and Spartacus leading man Liam McIntyre. Arn’t they both handsome?","04_liam","And then on March 16. The fun and games began.","Now I could spend the rest of the blog highlighting just how bloody incredible the shoot was for The Wizards of Aus. I could tell you how the crew went above and beyond, helping us to create the world that Shanks & Issell had envisioned from the very beginning. I could also tell you how humbling it was having a cast that stretched from industry legends like Guy Pearce, Bruce Spence & Mark Mitchell right through to established actors that would arguably be considered “up and comers” like Menik Gooneratne, Mark Bonanno, Rhys Mitchell, Matylda Buczko and Nicolette Minster.","But that’s not for this blog – we’ll have more Wizards BTS than you can throw a stick at in the New Year, so stay tuned!

Avengers is like any other Marvel film these days. Sure it’s entertaining as hell but it’s a bit same same. We’ve seen all those battles before, the storyline feels vaguely familiar and it’s the same old faces playing the same old characters. But like I said – still entertaining as hell.","WE WRAPPED.

Unfortunately this wasn’t the case.","Hocking & Shanks dived straight into post production and Sumah and myself handed ourselves over to those pesky Daperis brothers for a rather big music video they had in the works.

The clip is for their upcoming 2016 release The Swell and was one hell of a concept. We basically sunk a pre built bar in a diving pool with the help of some professional divers & riggers (the same amazing team from Showtech Australia who helped us launch our rocketship for our short film Rocketman). It was a tricky shoot as we were basically working inside a little hot box and with some amazing free divers, a lot of whom hadn’t acted on camera before but somehow the Daperis boys pulled it off with their regular collaborator Shelley Farthing-Dawe (with the help of underwater camera operator Jon Shaw) shooting pretty underwater pictures.","09_pool","And on top of editing Wizards, rotoscoping goblins and setting up an underwater communications system, Hocking managed to take the time out to talk on a Post Production panel at St Kilda Festival for the ASE(like he wasn’t busy enough already!)."]},{"l":"JUNE","p":["So there were some questionable big budget releases this month.

I know, I’m adorable.","June brought us some more festival success ( Palindromes again killing it, screening at the prestigious Palm Springs short film festival), more shooting (some sketches for Melbourne comedy duo Girls Uninterrupted) and you guessed it, more Wizards post production with Hocking and Shanks continuing to work around the clock to get the show done, one visual effects shot at a time!","Stay tuned for Part 2…","10_cat"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Directing The Wizards of Aus","p":["Across the 90-minute runtime of our series, we approximate to have more than double the amount of VFX shots as The Fellowship of the Ring (which is rare for an Australian series - especially in the low-budget space). Now, of course, having an excess of VFX certainly isn’t a measure of quality - otherwise The Phantom Menace would probably be the greatest film of all time, which I’m pretty sure isn’t the case. What that does mean, however, is that this show was exceedingly hard to make- requiring more than 36 weeks stuck in the edit suite with Chris Hocking (Series Producer/The other VFX Slave).","Aside from our 1,000+ VFX shots, we had our amazingly talented production people create great costumes for wizards, orcs, and men made of endlessly melting butter. Our puppeteers built several working puppets, ranging from the simple (a talking hat), to the difficult (a 7 foot tall articulated baby-skeleton monster), to the incredible (an amazing talking shark-man named Terry). All this from a team of hungry artisans with an average age of 25! This talent allowing beautiful, practical work to be placed in the frame of our genius DP Benjamin Hidalgo De La Barerra.","Basically, it should cost as much to animate a character in a spaceship as it does to animate them in a house - and that principle affords animation writers with a real freedom usually impossible for live action.","Before & After VFX. Pictured: A year down the toilet","Failing in his bid for secrecy, Jack’s magical existence is abruptly ousted to the Australian public and now he must deal with being a feared yet apathetic God in a City of Melbournians.","Good sentence, Michael.","However, I never could quite shake the idea out of my head. The sheer lunacy of the concept rattled around in my brain, and then five years later I found myself pitching it to an alarmingly enthusiastic Screen Australia.","However, no matter how much we subvert tradition, there are some fundamentals to writing narrative comedy that Nick and I are very passionate about respecting. This isn’t a sketch show, and as such there was always a reason behind each absurd choice – why should the audience care about the laws in our Universe if we didn’t’? As mentioned, we wrote ignoring the seeming ‘expense’ of our scripts. I wanted to approach the writing almost as though we were writing an Animation.","I shot the very first footage for The Wizards of Aus at age nineteen with a couple of my friends acting in it. Upon reviewing said footage, I thought ‘Oh, this is kinda shitty,’ and continued living my life.","I’ll be a lucky man to ever work with such a talented cast and crew, whose impeccable talents and efforts I truly believe are evident in the finished product.","It’s an insane show, and it’s certainly not for everyone. You could almost say it’s for practically no-one, but even if Wizards isn’t your cup of tea I’d like to think that the last thing you’ll think it is is a cup of boring.","It’s been a crazy journey getting this show made, but it’s never been anything other than joyous, even when it was utter hell. That’s a testament to our Producers and 1st AD.","Lead by the positively inhumanly driven Chris Hocking, we have truly the most committed and patient producers. As said, Nick and I wanted this show to have no ceiling to its ridiculousness, and Producers Nicholas Colla and Sumah Hurley rose to every challenge. Daniel Daperis was my long-suffering AD, whose calm head and amazing capacity to problem-manage, meant we all continued to feel creative and calm when time turned inevitably against us.","Michael Shanks directing.

We wrote the character for Mark, and Nick and I just about exploded when he agreed to come on board.","The Cast & Crew of The Wizards of Aus. Pictured: Love","The Wizards of Aus represents everything I’m passionate about when it comes to short-form filmmaking. It’s absurd, it’s fun, it’s (hopefully) unique and it aspires to do nothing if not be entertaining. It tells the story of Jack; a young wizard who decides he’s rather sick of fighting Goblins for Breakfast and Dragons for lunch and thus demands a change of scenery: Footscray (a sleepy suburb in Melbourne’s West).","This all contributes to my directing philosophy (I’m a douche) that filmmaking can’t just be theatre in front of a camera; it can be so much more than that. I’m not interested in making a comedy where every joke comes from the dialogue. Laughs can and should come from a camera move, a sound effect, blocking and framing – as much as a laugh can come from some words and a performance.","This freedom manifests itself in our show with the prevalent usage of Visual Effects to bring those scripts to life. I’ve been messing around with VFX in my spare time since I was 16, thus assuming I didn’t mind sacrificing an entire year of my life to slavishly compositing shots together with explosions/crowd-simulations/set-extensions/Animated-Sharkheads, then the Visual Effects were (in that sense) ‘free’.","To write the show, I teamed up with my bestest bud Nicholas Issell and we took delight in writing a show that no sane person would write. Our ethos was to let the scripts take us anywhere. As we bounced scene ideas around in the office, it didn’t matter how absurd (or expensive) they seemed – as long as they were funny they were considered. If the script demanded a giant fish monster, we wrote it. If the script demanded we suddenly teleport to the moon and murder main characters (for no other reason than it was funnier than not to do it) then we wrote it. It was key to us that the scripts always turn in unexpected directions to keep the audience guessing.","With a character at the opposite end of the spectrum, Menik Gooneratne brought real warmth and sympathy to ‘Kylie’, Jack’s grounded and caring case worker. To call Menik the utmost professional doesn’t do justice to her wonderful personality and presence. These two performances were the unshakeably, steadfast bedrock upon which I could pitch my own narcissistic and average-at-best performance as Jack."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Blocking","p":["‘B’ and ‘C’ scenes are more relevant to what I’m about to explain regarding blocking. They are a little less important to the overall story and if push comes to shove (e.g – it’s 1630, you’re an hour down and you’re getting death stares from the 1st who’s chewing gum at a frantic pace!) we can afford to drop a shot or two with the knowledge that the scene will still cut together fine.","• Wide master• 2 shot as they walk• 2 x singles once they’ve stopped","4 shots.","Anyway, I digress.","Anyway, I’m off to go produce….uh….I mean direct!","Blocking is essentially the placement and movement of your cast through the space. To me, this is the MOST important responsibility of a director and should be so carefully thought out and considered. Because really, there is no right and wrong and there are an infinite amount of ways the scene can be blocked out. It’s the responsibility of the director, to come up with the best way to do it.","blocking_01","blocking_02","blocking_03","Clearly blocking plays a massive role and it’s nice to be able to share my two cents about something that I’ve recently learnt myself as a director. Now, I always try to pay special attention to every possible scenario of blocking, taking into account all of the things listed above. It’s certainly helped me immensely.","Firstly I want to preface everything hereafter by saying that I’m not a director with decades of experience and countless awards to my name. I’m not in super high demand and I can assure you I’m not earning the big bucks. I’m relatively new…. ‘emerging’ as we like to call it. I still have a lot to learn and a long way to go to be able to eventually make the things I want to. But I will share with you something that I feel quite strongly about through my experiences so far. Something that I have noticed is often neglected, but is without doubt the single most important tool in the director’s arsenal – blocking.","Friend: So what do you do these days? Me: I’m a director. Friend: That’s so exciting! Hey guys, come over here, this guy’s producing movies!” Me: Actually I’m a director. Producers are different. Friend: Oh right, sorry I mean a director. Who’s higher – a director or a producer?","I think it’s also so important to have an open communication with your actors about it too. Using the same example above, I might ask the male actor if he feels like the husband should stand up when the conversation becomes heated and maybe walk over to the wife. The actors know their character motivation better than anyone and I think it’s great to ask and see how they feel. He might say no, because he feels that he has done wrong so is submissive at this point in the story and she finally has the upper hand on him so it feels more real that he stays seated and keeps his distance. Great! I have found that a huge part of directing is empowering those around you. In addition to working with the actors, it’s also great to work with your dp on the blocking and most importantly – be flexible. Naturally, you will plan your blocking in pre and then go over it the night before to understand where the characters need to be and at what point, but I think it’s such a strength if you are able to give them parameters rather than rules. Time permitting, it’s so great to be able to step onto set with your actors and dp with only a couple of key pointers (ie. In the last scene the character arrives in the driveway, so therefore they must enter the front door) but letting your actors naturally move through the space and work out blocking for themselves. Then measuring that against how you imagined the blocking and see what’s stronger and how it feels. Workshopping like this may take a bit more time initially, but may save later on by not reaching the unnecessary point of “it doesn’t feel right”. It also gives your dp a chance to feel out the scene and make some very important suggestions.","Let’s make up another scene – a husband and wife argue in the kitchen. The wife sits at the table and the husband walks into the room, stands by the sink and then they begin to fight. The actors have rehearsed it over and over and it just doesn’t feel right to either of them. As a collective we have reviewed every piece of dialogue and changed words into what feels more fitting. But after a couple of rehearsals, we’re still not nailing it. Let’s review the blocking. How about if the husband is sitting at the table, and the wife walks in and goes over to the sink. YES! All of a sudden, something as simple as switching the positions has changed the whole dynamic of the scene. The actors now feel so much more comfortable and natural in the characters. It sounds so strange, but the positioning of the actors in the space can have such a HUGE effect on how the character comes through. Body language, movement, interaction – it’s all so important for the actor, and it’s all blocking.","Let’s take a short 20 second scene that involves 2 characters giving some exposition. It’s not going to make or break your show. For the purpose of this example, let’s say there’s no dolly, it’s all handheld. The scene is written that they are walking down a corridor and then one stops and turns to face the other when something important is said. An obvious way to cover this, would be:","Ok, now assuming you trust your actors are solid and you will not need to ‘cut around’ performance, and you believe that they can give you the reaction to the important dialogue without the need to stop, then let’s make it a single shotter. How do you do this? Change the blocking! Let’s have them continue walking and not stop. You may have just dropped the 1st’s bp by about 50!","People seem fascinated with who is higher up the pecking order…and strangely enough it’s not such a simple question to answer. The reality is, not many people know too much about what a director actually does and after spending half the night explaining the roles, next time you see them, the question is generally the same, “How’s the film producing thing going?”.","Simply put, I’ve often heard that the two key things a director is responsible for once on set are ‘working with actors’ and ‘camera positioning’. These are definitely crucial aspects to capturing the scene. But what often comes as a bit of an afterthought and placed with a lot less significance is that of blocking.","So let’s very quickly go back to basics – what does a director actually do? To many outside the industry, the thought of a director instantly conjures up images of a Hollywood studio backlot in the 1930’s with a man smoking a cigar in a chair yelling orders through a megaphone. At a recent catch up with some very distant (and slightly intoxicated) friends, I had a conversation which seems to be a recurring dialogue with people I meet. I’d be surprised if many directors haven’t had this conversation at least once:","So the correlation between blocking and coverage is quite clear as it should be to most. But what about the way blocking affects working with actors? This is just as important. I know that as a director, there are quite often situations where on the day, scenes are just not working. Actors can often say to you that something just doesn’t feel right. Hopefully it’s obvious pretty early on in the first rehearsal that the actor is uncomfortable with how the scene is playing out. Otherwise it’s obvious in the edit and then it’s too late!! It’s so common to look at the script for the answer. Maybe if we lose this line, or change that line the character may come more naturally. Sometimes though this doesn’t work and it’s not a dialogue issue at all no matter how hard we search.","So what is blocking? Well to me it is the convergence of working with the actor and positioning the camera. It’s the first thing that must be thought up, which then determines everything else. So next time you’re under the pump to work quicker or your actors just don’t feel right, take a closer look at something that is often forgotten….blocking.","The most important (and neglected) aspect of directing…","This is a very simple example but you can imagine how much of an impact blocking has on your coverage in a more complex scene. Where you place your actors will determine how many shots you will need. If you place them apart, you will need two singles, if you have them together you may be able to get away with a 2 shot. I’m certainly not saying that you should always try to cut out shots, but highlighting that where you place the actors fully determines what shots you will need. This may seem obvious, but the amount of times I’ve seen directors unable to drop any shots because they absolutely need them all to make the scene work. But if they rethought the blocking, it may make the coverage a lot easier.","Why is this so important? Well it effects EVERYTHING! Your coverage is totally dependant on how the scene is blocked. Who is where? Where do they move? When do they move? I recently was lucky enough to sit down and have a chat with a vastly experienced TV director. It was interesting to hear him talk about splitting scenes into three categories – A, B and C. ‘A’ scenes were ones that were so important that there was no room for compromise. Think of a huge war scene that completes a series – it’s an integral part of the story and the full amount of time should be allocated to it and no shots can afford to be dropped. Full stop. Even if it means going into overtime despite the pressure from the 1st AD and producers. As he put it, “no producer has ever complained in the edit room when the scene is amazing. Only when there was a key shot missing because you were forced to cut it!” So ‘A’ scenes warrant a ‘no compromise’ attitude."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Djokovic v Abrams Semi-Final","p":["Tennis brings out the big guns."]},{"l":"CREDITS","p":["Created by: Michael Shanks Commentary by: Nicholas Issell & Michael Shanks Special Thanks To: Louie McNamara"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"year-in-review-2014--part-2","l":"Year in Review 2014 – Part 2","p":["Sure the first half of the year seemed relatively quiet in comparison to previous years.

Although we also saw the arrival of the superb Charlie’s Country, the pretty solid Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and These Final Hours, they were overshadowed by films like Sex Tape, Hercules, Jersey Boys, Mrs Brown’s Boys D’Movie and Deliver Us From Evil. It was the kind of month where you go to the cinema, look up at the screen, sigh and go and get yourself a FroYo.","So July launched us straight into post on Palindromes whilst Shanks was busy working with Sportsbet on some promo sketches for the upcoming World Cup. I’d like to take this opportunity to give an enormous heartfelt thanks and virtual hug to the unstoppable Paul Dawkins. A composer who we’ve been fortunate enough to work with for the last couple of years thanks to an introduction from our good friend Enzo Tedeschi. He did an incredible job on Palindromes against all odds and words can honestly not express how grateful we are to this amazing talent of a man. We love you and your work Paul and are forever in your debt!","After Sportsbet was done and dusted Shanks lent his VFX skills to a couple of music videos directed by Kess Broekman-Dattner and Luci Schroeder.

And hence came up with the title of our little film:","And that’s how it happened.","Bring on 2015.","But luckily – the shoot was pretty smooth. And by smooth, I mean completely improvised and manic.","By about 3am we split up to prepare – I went home and began the casting call, locking in the most powerful “film de femme” character I could find – Yasmine Khater. She was the star in my first Tour De Timor Documentary – so I figured any women who can accomplish the Tour De Timor could definitely pull this off! Then I roped in two more friends who I thought would make great Cast, Kimble & Mary, who started helping us to refine the dialog.","By about 5 am we had finally finished filming, and I could begin editing. Due to audio issues in the carpark – we actually did a lot of dialog as ADR also. All this post would need to be completed in less than 12 hours! And daylight was creeping in!","By midnight on Saturday – we needed to make a decision. We need a new location – somewhere with no restrictions. We needed the HUB.","By Saturday afternoon – roughly 3pm – we began filming. I was getting super nervous, as I knew I would be cutting it together, and I wouldn’t have much time. At all.","By Saturday morning, we began location scouting for some epic “Film De Femme” scenes…","Ed Cryer is one of those unique people you meet once and get super excited about working with.

The bonus is, he loves making videos so much he spends most of his spare time doing so.","Every year, the LateNite Films team competes in the 48 Hour Film Project. As a documentary filmmaker, if I’m in the country, I’ve always helped out in whatever way I can, as an editor, AD or simply carrying heavy boxes up stairs.","Everything after that was hilarious – we went “all out” on ridiculous sound effects to maximise laughs and entertainment value. We picked out funny songs and sounds and put nice long awkward pauses in the middle.","I edited everyone on FCPX – which is now the only NLE I use. I absolutely love the workflow and for the 48HFP I couldn’t imagine using anything else. It was super smooth to bring in all the footage from the Canon C100 and 5DMIII – and I did a generic grade and audio analaysis automatically to kickstart.","I LOVE the experience of it all. It’s basically one intense shitstorm of creativity and problem solving that brings together some of my all time favourite people in Melbourne. The concept, (as I presume most people reading this are already aware of) is that you have 48 hours to make a film.","It was such a ridiculous film to cut together – a lot of stupid fun and laughs. I actually ended up editing the whole night through, pulling in hundreds of sounds and music bites from the Envato library.","It’s a HUGE festival, and this year over 120 cities participated with more than 60,000 people. That’s a WHOLE lot of crazy filmmakers. That community is what gets me so inspired. A reminder that it’s not JUST us that are crazy – there are plenty of others out there that are willing to give up their “weekend” for a torturous challenge.","Now.","Now. Ed, Abi and I are all ridiculously busy at the moment. We had so many deadlines last week, that we decided that we would be unable to do the 48HFP and instead meet up over dinner to catch up. Well, that plan backfired and dinner turned into a “HELL YES CAN’T WAIT FOR THE 48HFP!”","Richard stayed up with me practically the whole night, helping me come up with awesome ideas and solving problems with the story. His choice of elevator music was especially gold. One of the key problems we had though, was due to the fact we ran out of time – and so the story escalated VERY quickly. Which made us laugh.","Since being based here doing Documentaries, I have met a fair share of indie filmmakers. One of which, Abi (co-founder of The Film Guys) worked with me to start the #FilmBeers community. Abi and I both love indie film – and we wanted to see more filmmakers in Singapore unite.","Singapore has an amazing filmmaking culture – and has also been one of the cities taking part in the competition since 2008. Not only that, there are many other competitions like the Cathay Motion Picture Awards trying to promote the same community and concept.","So, as you can imagine, when I left Melbourne to be based in Singapore, I was devastated when the reality struck that I probably wouldn’t be taking part in the big event as often. When LateNite made their film Wrong Way Right this year – I was affected by massive FOMO. (Fear of Missing out).","Thank you so much to all our friends who were crazy enough to join us on the ride. I think what I love most about this competition, is the same thing that I love about filmmaking in general – the film family you find along the way. I’m so happy that I finally feel like I have found my like-minded indie-filmmaking friends here and can’t wait to see what we create in the future together.","That was until I met Ed.","The way it works is pretty simple: On the Friday night, you are assigned a character, a prop, a line of dialogue and a genre, that must be included in the movie. 48 hours later, you must submit your 4-7minute length film.","Then – we hit “SHARE” and made our way to the finish line.","We all jumped on this – what a contrast!?

Working with someone like Samuel Johnson gives the project great authenticity, so I’m then able to approach great people about working with me. The first person we hit up was Michala Banas, whom Samuel had just done a play with. She was on board straight away, and from there, we could use her name and Samuel’s name. From here, I set about casting the show with my good buddy, and the best casting agent I know, Sarah Hallam (also a pretty damn good actor & director). I’m never interested in just packing the show with ‘name’ actors. They have to be the right fit. But having a couple of names attached allows us to shoot for the top. We were pretty fortunate to get a cracking cast full of up and comers, the next big lot of actors, Luke McKenzie, Tegan Higginbotham, Steph Lillis, Lee Beckhurst & Jesse Velik are wonderfully complimented by Michala, Samuel, Rhys Muldoon, Tottie Goldsmith, to name a few.","Be grateful, gracious and humble, and let your audience and supporters know that they are an integral part of your show. They ARE your show. Without them, there is no show. Don’t forget that. The story may be the thing, but the audience is the what. Coin a phrase for them. Our supporters are all part of the Sweatshop Nation.","Beyond the crowd funding campaign, we will be shooting the pilot episode, packaging it, and taking it to ABC2 and SBS. Failing a pitch with either of these networks, we go back to the public, and look at other options. Maybe we go back and crowd fund for the whole season. Maybe we just make the whole show, and then self distribute. Maybe we just give it away for free, and create an entire world around the life of the show - BTS, Director’s Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Gag Reels, Merch - are just some ways you can recoup your output.","By way of example - currently, the plan is to shoot it on a Canon C100 with stills lenses. This would give it a great look, as the C100 and the glass is very nice. However, if we can hit around the $15k mark, we’ll be able to get a RED Epic and some cine lenses, upping the ante on our aesthetic and production value (not to mention make the shoot even more enjoyable for our crew, who are all working for next to nothing).","cast","cast2","Check out our Pozible page for more info!","How did it feel to reach your target so quickly?","How have you found the experience so far/any tips for people looking at crowd funding for their projects?","How have you managed to get such an great cast attached?","I have really enjoyed the process so far. It’s stressful at times, especially when you’re about to put it out into the world, but it is also your first opportunity to engage with an audience. And, at the end of the day, we’re all here to tell stories for an audience.","I think I had about 6 days to get the campaign together, to launch it on a date that would allow for a 4 week campaign, with enough time to process the money before the shoot at the end of the campaign (still with me?). This included working out how much we wanted to raise (the easy part), allocating parts of the budget to the crowd funding pledges, scripting a video, shooting the portion with Samuel, shooting the portion with me (thanks Nato), shooting some stuff with some actors in a park, in a gym and some voice over (because I never script anything straight forward), figuring out interesting rewards that are relevant to our show, figuring out an approach to the copy within the body of the campaign (story of the project; funds allocation; challenges). I worked around the clock for those 6 days to make the campaign as strong as it could possibly be.","I’d also been apprehensive about the association that I have had with crowd funding campaigns, predominantly related to a sense of entitlement I see in some campaigns, where it seems like just turning up and putting your project onto pozible should be enough to get you a cool $10k. No thought given to the rewards on offer, no real effort put into a video, and certainly no more than 5 minutes put into engaging the audience at this early and crucial stage.","I’ve always been petrified of crowd funding. I have had projects before where I’ve thought about it, but I’ve always found a reason not to do it. “You only get one chance”; “I don’t want to be another one of those campaigns”; and “what if no one likes the idea” are common thoughts that roll through the hollow cavity that sits on my neck.","Out of this world, staggering, humbling, amazing, sexy, stunning, mind blowing! Forgetting the fact that it meant we were definitely going to make the show, the generosity and interest that the campaign has sparked in the project is truly remarkable. To reach our goal in two weeks was a pretty amazing feat, but to then blow, not one, but TWO of our stretch targets out of the water in 15 days (a little over half) of our campaign… I was, and still kind of am, speechless.","Plenty.","Previously, Alistair wrote and directed the short film Shotgun! which won Best Director and Best Comedy at the 2010 New York Independent International Film Festival. Shortly after that we teamed up with Alistair and tried to turn the short film concept into a feature film, but it never quite got off the ground (for those that are interested, you can read about that adventure here– including the very cool live script read). In 2012, we teamed up with Alistair again when he wrote and directed a funny little short film we co-produced called Joshua(which was our first attempt at doing “a film a weekend”). Alistair recently wrapped production on his first music video called Werewolf, for new band Hey Frankie, which will be released next month.","So, naturally when it was suggested to me that we crowd fund to raise a short fall of our budget for Sweatshop, I was hesitant and skeptical. But when I crunched the numbers, and worked backwards from our shoot dates, I realized that I didn’t have time to hesitate. I had to pull the trigger and bite the bullet. Which is hard to do without blowing your head off.","Sweatshop is a TV series that I’ve been writing with Phil Spencer for about two years now. Think Clerks meets Wilfred, set in a gym. It’s a place where pop culture meets fitness, and nothing is quite as it seems. It’s a TV show made by fans of great film & TV, so, naturally, it has all those quirky elements you’d come to expect from the aforementioned shows, as well as things like Workaholics, Louie and just about anything Kevin Smith has done. It’s not straight comedy, it’s not straight drama - it’s a melting pot of genre bending hilarity.","Tell Us About Sweatshop.","Thankfully, I’d done those 2 or 3 years of research. I established what I loved about some campaigns, and common areas where I felt that others were weak. From there, it was a race against time, but we got there. And now we have a little under 2 weeks to try and smash our stretch targets out of the water. What a position to be in!","thanks","The first thing I’ll say is, do research. I remember years ago when I was working with LateNite we were talking about doing crowdfunding. And Chris very aptly pointed out that you really only get one crack at getting it right, and building an audience’s trust. That has stuck with me ever since, and I have poured over many, many crowd funding campaigns since. Studying the rewards on offer, the structure of the campaign, the videos, the updates… Leaving no stone unturned in the life of the campaign.","The idea was loosely based on my life and the things I was going through circa June 2012. I’ve never been a PT (although I’ve gone to a fair few), but it seems to me as though the politics and incidents that occur in a gym are the same as in any environment. But on steroids. Punintentional. It’s a turnstile environment, with people from all walks of life constantly coming and going, and in today’s age of superficial gratification, is the perfect setting to put my own experiences, and people in general, under the microscope.","The important thing to note here, is that hitting our target means we have enough to make our show, and make a very good show. The stretch targets just mean we can take it from a very good show, to a great show, thus giving us the best possible chance of getting attention, and being a success.","The Netflix model, that has seen so much success for shows like House of Cards, is becoming a more realistic approach - make the whole show, and give it to the audience. Let them, no sorry, let YOU decide when and how you watch it. We just need a platform to launch that from. Any ideas?","To be completely honest with you, I didn’t give too much thought into how I would run the campaign via social media, such was the nature of getting this together in such a short amount of time. However, after a couple of days of positive traction and audience interaction, I quickly figured out that what the audience wants is to see the show coming to life. Introducing actors, crew, parts of the show and stunt offerings all help drive pledges and traffic.","To me, it backs up my point earlier about really using the crowdfunding campaign as your first port of call for your show, project or product. Engage the audience, introduce them to and get them excited by that thing that you’re more passionate about than anyone else. I guess it’s a modern “build it and they will come” kinda deal.","Today we have a special guest blog entry from long-time friend and collaborator, Alistair Marks. Alistair has worked with MTV, Nickelodeon and recently spent a year following Samuel Johnson around Australia as director of the Network 10 documentary Love Your Sister.","Today we’re chatting with Alistair about his latest project, Sweatshop. Enjoy!","We’re not done yet. While we didn’t expect to get this far, this quickly, we did make a “best case scenario” plan. So, we are launching into phase 2 of our crowd funding - stretch targets.

Perhaps it’s best to start simple. Hello. My name is Sumah Hurley. I’ve had the good fortune to work for and with the brilliant minds behind LateNite Films and through a cruel twist of fate they’ve conscripted my humble self to write a blog. This is that blog: the happenings of a fresh cadet thrown into the midst of the bustling Melbourne film & television scene.","Being the first blog entry, I should perhaps bring you up to speed with the adventures so far. In a bad attempt to avoid cliché roller-coaster analogies I just have to say since moving to Melbourne eight months ago it has been a thrilling ride. Already I have had the chance to work on a variety of remarkable projects and had the pleasure of meeting many filmmakers with the talent and experience anyone in my position would envy. Not that I am an envious person in any regard… Okay, perhaps a little bit. While that was exactly what I planned when I packed up my belongings and moved to this wonderful city, it has unquestionably happened a lot sooner than I intended.","Meeting LateNite has been an absolute highlight - and I’m not just saying that because they will read this. They are a strong, talented team of creatives who without reservations graciously accepted me with open arms. They didn’t waste anytime either.

It’s my only cameo in the film, even though no one but the crew and myself know I was in it.","hit-team","I must say the Daperis Brother’s have such passion for their ideas. It’s no surprise that people want to offer up their time and skills without question. This film was no exemption. We had some of the best in the industry helping to create the boy’s vision. Even Daniel turned to me on day one just in awe of their generosity. It astounds me how blessed we were to not only have the crew we did but also the incredible cast. Each one was as dedicated as they were talented. Even to the point where one of the actors calls two days before shooting to inform me that they were in hospital, but to worry because they’ll leave with enough time to get to set. That’s dedication. I mean that’s some messed up kind of dedication to put it bluntly, but it is that commitment from all involved that made the film what it was.

The Medical Ship is made possible by their army of volunteers, philanthropists and companies— no-one out of the 120 full time staff based in Townsville & PNG gets paid a cent. PNG based company InterOil funds their fuel and was the organisation that got us involved in the first place, after their CEO serendipitously dropped by our co-working space in Singapore. The idea was to volunteer his staff – Anthony and Andrew – to join the outreach, and make a film to help document the journey – to help fundraise 6.5 million dollars for a new medical ship.","09","10-matt","11-mud","12 12-hannah Each night after shooting on the C100 and some days collecting a spattering of b.roll from Matt – I would connect the SD card directly into my Mac, connect my Thunderbolt LaCie, open up FCPX, create a new event, and import footage direct from the card. I then used ChronoSync– enabling Dissect Packages– to dupe the Library onto a cheaper USB3 rugged backup. Every second day I would back up again onto a third drive and so on.","14b 14a 13","15","A dear friend of mine was interested to see what other gear I take withe me when I travel – so just as a resource for others interested in the field, or for your curiosity; here’s some insights:","A little bit of back-story – before the Long Ride began – even before I moved to Singapore – a close friend of ours, Alistair Marks, approached LateNite about a story he wanted to tell. The story goes like this:","A young mother was dying from terminal breast cancer. Her brother, a much loved Australian celebrity, asked her; what could he do to support her? She told him that he needed to do whatever he could, to make sure no other mother would ever have to say goodbye to their children because of breast cancer. “… but how?” he replied.","Alistair had been filming Samual and Connie (the sister diagnosed) for an incredibly long time as a volunteer, passionate about the project and as a very close friend of both. We gave our camera equipment & helped film in whatever small way we could, from the starting line right up to the final moment when Samual “unicycled” back into Melbourne almost a year later. I had always intended on collaborating with Samual and Alistair to edit the years-worth of footage into a documentary film. It was a cause which I really connected with, especially the way in which Samual was spreading the message – through an absolutely bat-shit crazy adventure!","Amazingly, he said “OK” and Love Your Sister was born.","And – more shockingly than anything else – a complete suffocation-come-eventual-conversion to FCPX ! (Again, a longer post on that experience is still in the works – but yes, you read correctly, I’m 110% converted and would find great difficulty looking back on any other NLE. Anyone keen to buy an AVID dongle?).","Another Sennheiser Lapel kit","As you can imagine – when I first heard of this project – I was incredibly excited to see what would happen. Is it even POSSIBLE to uni-cycle around Australia? Across desserts? Thousands of kilometres? Let me just remind you – a UNI-cycle – UNI – i.e. ONE WHEEL. I couldn’t believe it would be possible. However, having heard this inspiring story, I knew Samual Johnston (the brother) would find the strength to do the best he could.","But TB is not the only issue facing the nation – with 1 in 13 children dying before the age of 5 and 94% of the population affected by Malaria. Whats worse is that all these people in need might have to paddle days in “dug-out” canoes to get to any kind of health care, because there simply aren’t any roads or methods of transport. Supplying hospitals or medical clinics for communities in PNG is, quite simply, a logistical clusterfuck. It’s just one of those things that comes with living in one of the most environmentally diverse and stunning places on earth – a mountainous, rain-forested, delta-mazed landscape – it’s tricky to get around.","But, about half way into the LYS journey – I had moved to Singapore officially – and by serendipity came into contact with another breast cancer awareness project. This one was under the National University Hospital of Singapore, being led by two breast cancer surgeons Dr Philip Lau and Mikael Hartman. Their story is a little different:","Canon c100","Cutting a very long and passionate conversation short: tuberculosis shouldn’t exist. It’s been wiped out in most developed nations around the planet and with good reason: There is a cure. There is medical treatment. Therefore, no family should have to die from it.","Filmmaking was tough in the conditions – mud, mud and more mud made filming and walking difficult. Getting from the boat to the shore was always a tad precarious, and, on the second last day of the main shooting, a shady wooden bridge collapsed underneath Matt in one of the villages, sending him plummeting into the muddy pig-shit/croc-infested water beneath, loosing two 5DmarkIII cameras, a 200mm lens and the lovely 24-70mm. He even lost the indestructible Leica with a crack!! Everything was insured – and thankfully a large percentage of the shots he needed had been done – PLUS he still had his faithful and sentimental 5DmII and a bag full of lenses – so it wasn’t the end of the world.","Firstly – 2014 was time to finally upgrade my documentary equipment and workflow. After much research/panic – and cutting a VERY long geeky story short (maybe that’s for another time) – I kitted up with:","How are we any different to that boy in his village? Who knows what worlds are waiting out there.","However, in PNG – tuberculosis is rampant.","I didn’t do too much editing on the trip – however did do a daily log of any clips with interviews or dialog into a “Script” keyword and in every event, and dragged over from each event 2 smart collections to divide my current edits & my “assistant editing” (AE) assembles:","I pack everything down into a travel pack – so I have easy access to gear from a backpack which is my check-in – then ThinkTank & Pelican comes carry-on.","I read an article a long while ago, that really stuck with me, about how artists and creative people often feel like “fakes” even once they are incredibly successful.","I think this point is proven best, through my experience meeting people in nations which are still on the cusp of development. Today, for example, I interviewed a millionaire executive from Papua New Guinea as part of our project. He couldn’t tell me his age, because in the village he grew up, they did not count the days or weeks or months. There was no school – no medical clinic – and it wasn’t until a charitable organisation from New Zealand came to his village – did he come to realise there was more to the his world than his own community. From that exposure to this “new world” he decided to learn more… and so his future rolled out.","If I hadn’t abandoned my rationale about what’s possible – I never would have made it this far. And now, since moving to Singapore, surrounded by a city ingrained with constant innovation & growth – I feel like I’m back at the starting line.","If it was tough for us – I can’t imagine how tough it must have been for the volunteers that’s came from around the world to take part. Every day, we filmed these people, from all ages and backgrounds, from 15 years old to mid-late 70’s, from medical students to retired dentists – we filmed them setting up medical clinics in the middle of nowhere, perform thousands of vaccinations, offer prenatal care, pull out thousands of rotting teeth in the dental clinic (well, matt filmed that part for me) and educate as many people as possible about TB, Malaria, Safe Pregnancy and general health advice and knowledge.","It sounds insane (to me, and probably most of family & co-workers) to think of living life any larger than I do already. But why? That judgement is made purely from our own personal experience and journey. As soon as you expose yourself to a world bigger than you imagine, your world grows.","It’s been an honour and a struggle these last few months working on the project – I’ve followed the footsteps of their crazy expedition to meet women from all over Asia to find solutions and share their story, from Hospitals in Thailand to peer-support groups in Malaysia. I also travelled to Sweden to film the anthropological team who are doing a 2 year research project into the increasing death toll.","It’s midnight on the last night of shooting what was an incredible documentary project in the Gulf Province of Papua New Guinea. I’m exhausted beyond belief – but I’m going to write this blog post. Even if it kills me. BOOM.","It’s no secret that I’ve gone down epic, scary pathways with NO option for return. And, being consistent with my previous years, 2014 is proving yet again, that what I had previously thought was “an incredible opportunity” is not even tipping the edge.","LaCie Rugged Drives","Maxed-out MacBook Pro","Meanwhile, as the Long Ride project expanded and evolved, Ashwin (my co-founder at GA) was busy developing a project for us in Papua New Guinea:","Now – I’m back in Singapore with thousands of hours of footage – ready to be made into one stellar documentary. My goal is to raise 2 million dollars through screenings of the film – but more importantly – the other ambition is to take the film we create BACK into the communities, holding screenings throughout the villages we visited. A rare opportunity that might just happen later this year.","Our cosmos is big – and no culture will ever be able to help you understand or explain just how BIG the possibilities of your potential are. You need to find your own limits, explore them – the more open we are, the more fears we confront, the more commitments we follow through — the more we discover, for better or for worse.","Pelican Laptop Hard-case (which flukingly fits both the Laptop & two drives! Thank-you PC design!!)","Since the end of last year, I had imagined that 2014 would be the year that I would be alongside two incredible surgeons motorbiking from Singapore to Sweden to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer research. However, as what always happens, life took some (many) unexpected turns and I was no longer able to join the Long Ride expedition as part of their filmmaking team, but instead, manage the project and edit the final film.","So – with gear sorted I was ready to travel…","So when dream projects find my way, and those typical insecurities set in, I have to remind myself that I’ve been working my ass off for this. THIS is the reason why people get incredible opportunities, meet awe-inspiring friends, find such compatible teammates and get PAID to do what they LOVE. It’s because you say YES when everybody else says NO. You smile & soldier on when everybody else turns sour & gives in.","So, inspired by Alistair, Samual and especially Connie – I took on the ambitious Long Ride Project to create a documentary film and help put a face to breast cancer in Asia.","So, let me kick-off some behind-the-scenes stories about where we’ve been exploring this year.","Some say that Papua New Guinea sit’s only a few kilometres away from the Australian border at the nearest point. For people that live in Townsville, the Capital of PNG; Port Moresby, is closer than their State capital; Brisbane. But despite this incredible proximity to one of the wealthiest and healthiest continents on the planet – PNG is sadly ravaged with poverty and disease.","That’s why YWAM Medical Ships Australia is such a beacon of hope for so many of these communities.","The best part for me though, was seeing the local volunteers. Papua New Guinea Nationals coming onboard, giving their time to help support their nation. Local community health workers, coming onto the ship and learning alongside our medical clinic staff, and Manu – the local dentist – coming onboard and inspiring everyone in the village. My interview with Sarah Dunn, the General Manager for Community Development at YWAM MSA, was utterly awesome – as she explained their approach to capacity building, empowerment and her dream to see Papua New Guineans running the medical ship, and seeing more empowered local medical professionals. The ultimate goal, was not to be needed anymore in PNG, and one-day seeing the nation use their ships & resources to reach out to other pacific islands with aid and support.","They decided, albeit a little foolishly, that they would travel through Asia & the world – from Singapore to Sweden – by motorbike – to learn more about the different Asian cultures & anthropology – to get a better understanding of the struggles medical professionals and patients might face in different regions. At the time I met them they had no idea how they would share their story, communicate their message, or even set up a facebook page.","ThinkTank SpeedRacer V2.0 (the perfect fit for the awkward camera build)","This type of project was a dream job for me – the perfect scenario: Creative freedom, genuine curiosity about a place I’ve not yet had the chance to explore with unique access to places which are otherwise almost unreachable, a cause which is unequivocallyimportant in a country which is in serious need of support, inspiring subjects to interview and leaders to look up too, and my favourite – a whole lot of “protagonists” which I knew would have a life-changing and out-of-their-comfort-zone experience. Needless to say – it was a remarkable experience.","UNIQLO is like IKEA for clothing – but ethical. A close friend who worked there always told me stories of their inspiring ethics & manufacturing, but it wasn’t until my photojournalism friend Matt Lynn digressed that everything he wears comes from their stores – that I thought I would check it out. Simply put, a lot of things I own now come from there. I still have a Mountain Designs down-vest and merino long sleeve I can’t live without – and Arcteryx sponsored some wet weather gear on a previous project which I also find comes in handy in tropical locations. So clothing = sorted.","When Ash (my co-founder at GA) told me about the project, I knew it wasn’t going to be a walk in the park – and immediately flagged it with my friend Matt to see if he was keen & available to shoot the photography. Although it would have been a luxury to have other crew to help with the documentary, with my new kit I was confident that I could take on the production solo alongside Ash & Matt to lend a hand.","When Mikael Hartman first came to Singapore from his home-country in Sweden – he was absolutely shocked to find that within his first 10 months, he saw more advanced breast cancer cases than his last 10 YEARS in Sweden. He spoke with his college, Singaporean, Dr. Philip Lau, and they both decided that they would have to do something, and find out more, about this disparity.","WHY are the women coming so late, too late, to the hospital? It’s a question we all want answered, and our documentary will hopefully continue to document the answers."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"MAN","p":["Early last year Chris Hocking flew up to Western Australia to help our very good friends Dave Christison(Producer) and Richard Hughes(Director) with their epic short film ‘MAN’ – an award winning 19-minute short drama that explores the underbelly of Australia’s regional drug epidemic and tackles the universal theme of what it means to be a man.","On the verge of forced retirement, a worn-out, ageing shearer, who once rained king of the high country, gets on the gear to keep up his numbers.

Unfortunately however, getting timecode to work successfully and reliably in Numbers has never been something I’ve been able to fully accomplish.

It’s also completely compatible with Excel and Numbers – and it’s free.","What’s REALLY exciting though, is that the incredibly clever Stockholm-based Henrik Cednert has put together an awesome script (inspired by Nuke/Hiero Timecode Calculator) that allows you to calculate timecode within a Google Sheets document. It’s early days, and the code does not currently support obscure non-even frame rates (i.e. 23.976fps) – but apart from that, it’s incredibly simple and powerful, with support for timecode addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, percentages as well as timecode conversion (i.e. 24fps to 25fps). If you’re in 25fps land, this is an incredibly useful tool that you can make use of today. For assistant editors who have to spend a lot of time crunching timecode within a spreadsheet – this could save you a HUGE amount of time.","As Google Sheets is cloud-based, this is nothing something you can just download and install – you need to have a Google Account, and then “Make A Copy” of Henrik’s document, storing your own version in your personal Google Drive account.

Maggie is awesome, and it’s great learning the history of such amazing projects and films.– The Nerdist: Chris Hardwick, Jonah Ray and Matt Mira have a very informal and normally completely random and hillarious conversation with someone famous. Listening to this podcast is like gate-crashing a discussion at a house party.– digitalCINEMAcafe: Chris Fenwick & Alex MacLean have an open discussion with industry professionals. Chris and Alex are awesome – and they bring on some truly fantastic guests.– The Edit Bay: Shane Ross tells stories from the edit bay. The bad clients, the disasters, the triumphs… the fun stuff. This is a really short, really tight, really awesome scripted podcast – highly recommended!– The Terence and Philip Show: Terry Curren and Philip Hodgetts bring their not-politically-correct opinions on Avid, Adobe, Apple, post production, production, distribution and pretty much anything they want to talk about. The show has no fixed duration or schedule, taking the form of a free-form discussion between the hosts, who bring their years of industry knowledge to the discussion. Terence and Philip aren’t afraid to talk about extremely complex and technical subjects – which is great.– This Week in Enterprise Tech: Father Robert Ballecer, aka Friar Tech explores the complex, cutting edge world of enterprise technology with IT professionals explaining the ins and outs of enterprise solutions.

Josh, Juan and Jason are incredibly talented, and very, very smart – and because they work in different markets all have a very different perspective on highly complex creative and technical discussions.– That Post Show: Kanen Flowers has a roundtable discussion with industry experts about the art and science of video, film and post production. Kanen is one of the best interviewers in the podcasting space. He’s super intelligent, and just a joy to listen to – he also gets some of the best experts in the industry to chat on the show.

Your hosts Maggie McFee and Christopher Harrington discuss everything in excruciating detail, from video production to how to make your own giant robot. Each week they take a topic, deconstruct it, and if you’re lucky, put it back together without any leftover parts. Nerdy. Fun.

An open-hearted hip-hop rapper, he shared a light on his shameful history of crime and alcohol, while declaring his newfound ambitions and dreams to overcome his past & become a famous performer! He could make everyone laugh and was an absolute joy to be around. There is no discrimination here, and everyone is free to practise whatever faith they wish, so the next morning at the break of dawn, when I heard the sound of muslim prayer — even as an atheist— I prayed for Johns success.","Leaving Father and Mother Behind, Let us fight, under the banner of Karang Widya..

But I know we will continue to support them in every way we can, sharing their story and encouraging others to do the same.","My Bahasa was vague as I introduced myself and our small team, to the youth that started to curiously surround us. I knew already researching the project that these young adults harboured memories no-one would want to hold on too. Straight away I knew these kids would be different than other youth I had interviewed before — something about the confidence in the way they first approached me, and the vulnerability when they spoke. They looked tough, but welcomed us into their new home with genuine warmth.","Now there is a whole new world for me to discover!","Once a student graduates from the program, the board members try and support them through extensive networks. Some graduates get work at other organic farms in the region, while others simply go back to their villages — with new knowledge and accomplishment. Akinus from Western Papua had a simple dream: to return to his village and teach his community about organic farming.","One boy had come here from the rainforest island of Borneo. When both his parents were tragically killed in an accident, orphaned, he tried to survive by working in an industrial mine. After two weeks of witnessing the extent of the environmental destruction of his island, he quit.","One by one we met incredible Alumni who had literally changed their lives from despair and darkness into inspiring members of their community.","One by one, I spend some time with each student, listening to their stories with a translator by my side to help express their words. One by one, I am brought to tears by the raw sadness of their young life. Many were caught up with drugs and alcohol, but some were simply from families too poor to send them to school.","Santibi is not alone in his success since leaving The Learning Farm. Another Alumni, Iwan, has had an inspiring career as a teacher and facilitator at a number of different schools, despite his dark past. When we spoke to him about the most memorable lesson he has learnt in life, he recited a quote his teacher used to say to him during the TLF program:","Some students wrote about how they would hold people at knife-point to steal money, or worse — prostitute themselves to older women. Most of the students had lost their sense of self-worth & dignity. One 17 year old boy opened up to us, admitting that his mother and father showed him nothing by love — and he abused that.","That’s how we met Santibi.","The Kampung (garden) is full of fruits and vegetables, and everyone is working hard to keep the garden beds in perfect condition. Pak De teaches everyone about the process of organic farming with a great love and sense of humour, and the students take pride in their work.

The problem was – even if you know these functions are there, how do the actually access them?","Back in November last year, I was listening to a FCPX Grill episode with Alex Gollner, where he talked about talked about a secret “debug mode” he discovered whilst looking through all the FCPX .plist and .nib files.","Back when I first listened to Alex talking about these discovers on the podcast, I thought it was cool and interesting, but as I wasn’t actually using FCPX for jobs, I didn’t really think too much else of it. However, now that I’ve been playing with FCPX more and more, these “secret” options seemed more and more intriguing – specifically, I was really interested to see what these mysterious “Guard” functions where – especially given that Apple has some patents in editing collaboration technology. Alex also spoke a bit about what these features could be in his blog.","DISCLAIMER: This blog post is purely for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Only use these instructions at your OWN RISK.

They’re essentially an XML file that store a list of settings or preferences (very similar to .ini files on Windows).","I’ve had a play with most of the functions revealed – but there’s nothing really useful in there that I can see (except maybe the “Periodic Backup Interval” and the “Suspend Background Options During Playback” – but I’ll have to do some more testing). I was really hoping that enabling “Guards” would do something magical – but it doesn’t seem to do anything as far as I can tell – although maybe if you have two clients accessing the same project over a SAN, you’d see additional options? The “Automatic Crossfade Duration” also seems interesting – but again, I couldn’t actually work out what it did. Like the name suggests – these are all DEBUG functions – so unless you’re an Apple developer with access to the FCPX code, they’re not very useful or helpful.","If anyone has FCPX running on a SAN and works out how to activate and use the “Guards” functionality – let me know!

They allow programmers using Apple’s free Xcode application to create and manipulate user interfaces graphically instead of programmatically – giving developers the chance to see the results of their changes instantly. This means that they can change the layout and design of a user interface with a few mouse drags, rather than rewriting any code – speeding up development time.","Once you’ve finished playing – you can simply trash your FCPX preferences to undo all the debug preferences changes (keeping in mind this will reset ALL the preferences for FCPX). It’s important to note that Mavericks seems to do some caching with plist files – so you actually need to do a restart for the plist files to actually “reset”. You can then delete the duplicated Final Cut Pro application, and go back to the way things were.","secret_fcpx_settings","So where do you find these files? Mac OS X handles most applications as “bundles”. A bundle is a directory structure that groups related files together, and are used for GUI applications, frameworks, and installer packages. These are presented to the user as one file in the Finder. When set up correctly, bundles make for easy deployment – as end users just need to deal with one file, rather than a whole bunch of files (like you’d find on Windows). This is one of Apple’s biggest strengths – because to an end user, when they download an Application, in most cases all they need to do is drag a single file to their Applications folder and you’re done – as opposed to Windows, where you need to run a installer which throws files all over the place. To access the contents of a bundle, all you need to do is simply right click on an application in Finder and select “Show Package Contents”.","So, long story short – I decided to do some testing of my own…","Step 1: Duplicate the “Final Cut Pro.app” within Finder by right clicking on the application and selecting duplicate, or pressing CMD+D.

Their very slick and comfortable “Theatre 1” is perfectly set up for Atmos mixes (and of course realtime 5.1/7.1 down-mixes – thanks to Dolby’s fancy Rendering and Mastering Unit), and has been specifically built to provide the Feature Film and Cinema Commercials markets with the finest mixing and delivery environment in the country. It was a massive investment, but it’s so exciting and makes me so proud to see a Melbourne company getting in early and experimenting with this exciting tech, and offering such a high-end and compelling service to the local and international market. I really hope it takes off!","Since launching just over a year ago (where it was first utilised in Pixar’s Brave), over 40 films around the world have been announced or released with Dolby Atmos sound (you can check out the complete list here), with more than 100 screens enabled globally. Sadly, in Melbourne, apart from Soundfirm the only other place you’ll hear Atmos is the Reading Cinemas in Waurn Ponds– however, I’m personally now on a mission to try and bring Atmos to Village VMAX at Knox. Trust me… once you hear it, you won’t want to go to a theatre without it – so PLEASE let Dolby and your local theatre know, by completing this form(it only takes a few clicks – promise!). Feel free to do it twice – once with your local theatre, and once with VMAX at Knox!","soundfirm","Atmos unleashes the potential of sound in storytelling by giving filmmakers and mixers the creative freedom to easily place or move specific sounds anywhere in the movie theatre, not just wherever there happens to be speakers. It gives filmmakers full creative control over the placement and movement of sound around the audience enabling the precise matching of audio to onscreen action.","Dialogue follows characters. Sound effects track with camera pans. Ambient sounds literally surrounds you. As lame as it sounds, for the first time, you’ll hear the whole picture.","In Melbourne, most theatres offer what’s called 5.1 surround sound– meaning there’s speakers at front left, front centre, front right, rear left, rear right and a sub-woofer – exactly the same as you’d find in most consumer/home surround sound systems. Sadly, there are currently only 10 theatres in Victoria that offer 7.1. surround sound– which adds two discrete channels establishing four distinct “surround zones” in the theatre for a more vivid and engaging moviegoing experience. I used to have a 7.1 Dolby Digital EX setup at home – and those additional two speakers really did make a big different – although it’s really hard to find a DVD that offers true 7.1 sound.","However… Atmos simply blows this all out of the park.","atmos_diagram","Atmos does away with the notion of speaker channels, and instead controls each and every speaker completely separately. It now gives theatre owners the option of installing a wider range of surround speakers in the roof of their theatres – as opposed to just on the side walls like you would in a traditional 5.1 or 7.1 setup. How many speakers you install really depends on the size of the room. Interestingly the Dolby guys mentioned last night that they actually had to install two separate Atmos systems in the Dolby Theatre(formerly known as the Kodak Theatre) in Hollywood because of the balcony.","Basically, this allows sounds to be rendered in a 3D environment, meaning that rather than a sound coming roughly from the left or right, the sound will appear from an exact point in the cinema, in 3D – it could be above, below, to the left or to the right of you. Last night we were lucky enough to watch the “destruction” sequence from Gravity– and it was absolutely incredible. It broke all the traditional rules (i.e. dialogue would fly around the room) – but it brought with it a level of realism so perfect and so detailed that it absolutely has to be heard to be believed. I originally watched Gravity in Village VMAX’s 5.1 cinema at Knox – and the difference is very obvious – Atmos makes you really feel like you’re there. If I had a choice between 3D and Atmos, I would pick Atmos any day of the week. They also showed us another demo of a jungle soundscape – and the depth of the sound is simply amazing – you could literally hear monkeys climbing across the room from the rear of the theatre to the front, and birds flying all around you.","atmos_monitor","The format allows for an unlimited number of audio tracks to be distributed to theatres for optimal, dynamic rendering to loudspeakers based on the individual theatre’s capabilities. The hardware supports up to 128 discrete audio tracks and up to 64 unique speaker feeds. In addition to playing back a standard 5.1 or 7.1 mix using arrays, the system will give each loudspeaker its own unique feed, thereby enabling many new front, surround, and even ceiling-mounted height channels for the precise panning of select sounds such as a helicopter or rain. At the same time, Atmos promises to revolutionise movie distribution by eliminating the need for multiple print masters – i.e. a single delivery file will now play faithfully in any theatre – although this concept brought with it a bit of playful heated discussion last night, as the industry still struggles with Interop vs SMPTE DCPs. However, if Interop eventually (and finally) dies, then this will hopefully become a reality.","The tech behind the scenes is actually quite interesting – although in the scheme of things, apart from the “magic” that’s happening in the Dolby Rendering and Mastering Unit (RMU) – everything else is fairly simple and logical. I would even go so much to say they’re doing a fair bunch of “hack jobs” to make the system work with traditional hardware (not in a bad way). You can learn more about the tech and what Atmos means to content creators here.","Massive thanks to Australian Screen Sound Guild, Stuart Bowling and David Gould from Dolby and Soundfirm for running the event!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"FCPX Rant","p":["fcpx","Ever since Apple announced Final Cut Pro X (pronounced “Final Cut Pro Ten”) back in April 2011 I have been keeping a very close eye on it. Like many people, as soon as it was released in June 2011, I instantly bought and downloaded it, and started playing. You could see it had potential – but it was so different to it’s predecessor and lacked so many important basic functions. Although I’ve always had it installed on my laptop, and opened it up after each update Apple pushed out – it never looked compelling enough to actually use for a job."]},{"l":"Background","p":["Before I go down the FCPX rabbit hole, I just want to give you a quick run-down of my background for those that don’t know… I was one of those kids that grew up in the VHS-era. During school holidays, my brother, sister and whoever else we could rope in, would film Starwars-inspired movies on our Granddad’s trusty Panasonic G1, and edit them together using two domestic VHS recorders, with a cheap 4-channel audio mixer in-between for fancy real time mixing. During high school I did a couple of little projects on Premiere on a PC – but never really got into it as the software was so slow and unreliable. It wasn’t until a few years after high school when my brother purchased an iMac with Final Cut Express 2 and DVD Studio Pro (standalone), that I really started to get into Post Production and filmmaking in general. Being a massive computer nerd – the Mac was something completely new for me, and I absolutely loved it’s simplicity and power. Final Cut Express essentially inspired me to quit my career as a Lighting Designer, and head to Swinburne University to study a Bachelor of Film & Television. During my time at Swinburne, I spent countless hours on Final Cut Pro cutting all kinds of short films, music videos and documentaries. I probably know Final Cut Pro better than any other piece of software.","In February 2009, after completing my degree I began my career in Post Production as the sole Assistant Editor at The Butchery– a highly respected and accoladed boutique offline editorial company in Melbourne. When I first started there were only two editors, both cutting in Avid Media Composer 3.0.5. Every single job was shot on 35mm film and delivered to us on MiniDV tape after the telecine session. Being thrown completely in the deep end, I had to not only learn Media Composer very quickly, but also start to develop rock-solid workflows for this rapidly growing editing house, as new shooting formats such as RED started to hit the scene. In the early days we didn’t have shared storage, so we just had to juggle drives and transfer files over the WiFi network. During this time I discovered the power and flexibility of Media Composer, and it became very clear why Avid was still (and to this day still is), the king of long-form and hardcore offline editing. It’s fast, it’s powerful, it’s reliable. In a post house environment – where you have multiple editors and assistants working on the same job – it just makes like so much easier, compared to Final Cut Pro.","Between 2009 and 2013, the company grew dramatically, and I moved up to Post Production Supervisor with four assistant editors now at the company, along with six extremely accomplished editors, and a sister company called The Refinery added to the mix – bringing with it a Resolve and Smoke/Flame suite. As the person responsible for all things technical – I became extremely proficient in networking, shared storage (especially Unity & ISIS), Linux-based Autodesk Systems, as well as developing workflows to get smoothly from offline to final delivery. During my time I worked on countless high-end award-winning TVCs as well as long-form documentaries, music clips and the occasional feature film. The large majority of projects were cut on Media Composer – but a lot of FCP7 projects also passed through. Moving projects from Avid to FCP and FCP to Avid was also a regular occurance.","At LateNite, we’ve been using Avid Media Composer for any big long-form projects (such as Hannah & The Hasbian), and up until the middle of last year, pretty much Final Cut Pro 7 for everything else. With the release of Premiere CC, we started to test it out on a couple of smaller corporate jobs, but the real test came when we decided to break our own rule:","48 Tip >> Use a tried and tested workflow. Never try new post software during a 48 film. Do export tests prior to near the deadline.","— LateNite Films 48 (@LateNite48) October 11, 2013","With both Cail Young and our very own Michael Shanks thinking we’re crazy for using FCP7 (Michael uses Premiere on a PC exclusively), we decided to risk it all and give Premiere CC a go for last year’s 48 Hour Film Project. Thankfully, Premiere CC performed perfectly, and our film was probably better than it would have been if we had decided to stick with FCP7, simply because Premiere is faster, and you have access to a lot better effects and plugins (I was so happy to see some of my ProTools plugins magically appear in Premiere!). I’m also a massive, massive fan of the Clip Mixer. Since this crazy weekend, Premiere has basically replaced FCP7 for us completely – I don’t even have FCP7 installed on my laptop anymore.","A lot of people joke that Premiere CC is basically FCP8 – but it pretty much is for better AND for worse. For jobs where I was starting and finishing within the NLE – I absolutely loved FCP7. It’s basically the Swiss Army Knife of NLE’s – it’s incredibly powerful, and you can do a huge amount of sound and effects work directly in the program. Although Avid has some really powerful built-in effects tool (i.e. I LOVE the Animatte) – even if you’re a highly experienced editor, the effects functionality sometimes just does your head in, as it works a bit differently to any other program and it’s certainly not intuative. Compared to FCP7 – the effects tools, although powerful in some respects, are clunky and unnecessarily confusing (especially once you start applying lots of effects to the one clip). FCP7 is fantastic because when you need to deliver something – whether it be a file or play out to tape – you know it can handle it. Yes – it has bugs and issues, but once you’ve used it long enough, you learn to master it’s issues and limitations and work around them (I certainly don’t miss the “General Error”). Avid on the other hand is basically designed for offline only – and you take your project to a Symphony, DS, Flame, etc. for online and final delivery. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rules – and you can finish a project completely in Media Composer (which we did with Divin’ Timor), but it’s certainly not the norm.","Premiere CC has the same benefits as FCP7 – it’s another extremely flexible and powerful Swiss Army Knife – but it also has some of the same limitations and annoyances. For example, unless you’re using Adobe Anywhere, your project is still contained within a single file. This slows things down incredibly if you have a massive project, but it also increases the risk of major file corruption as the project gets more and more complex. Avid’s big benefit is it’s simple, but incredibly powerful media management – where a project is actually a folder, and bins actually exist as individual files on the file-system level (which is fantastic, as it means you can easily throw bins around between projects and systems). The media management, when set up correctly is also rock solid – and the fact that you can literally “yank” out a drive mid-session, then plug it back in, and all the media magically reappears without crashing the program is pretty darn cool (even with AMA media).","Like FCP7, Premiere also seems to be plagued with a whole bunch of random bugs – presumably because it’s based on such an extremely old code-base. Every now and again we’ll open a project, and when you press play, everything starts playing at what seems like half speed for no apparent reason – it’s like Premiere has just completely forgot what frame rate it’s working in. The only way to fix this is to restart the application a few of times, and eventually it’ll come good. I have absolutely no idea why this happens, or what causes it. Another bug (that was common in FCP7) is that occasionally Premiere will loose track of render files. For example, you could render a whole timeline, save and exit Premiere, but when you open it again, everything is un-rendered (or just sections of the timeline). It seems as projects and sequences get bigger and more complex, Premiere can start getting a bit confused – and the risk of Premiere loosing track of render files becomes greater. Another thing we’ve come across is just general unreliability of renders. For example, we were recently rendering out an extremely complex timeline (with lots of GPU intensive effects). The first attempt had some corrupt frames (i.e. a couple of frames were just garbage). The second attempt had corrupt frames at a different point in the video. At this stage I was thinking maybe it was a GPU issue. However, the third attempt (using the exact same export settings as the previous two attempts), had perfect vision, but the audio cut out half way through the clip. Very bizarre – but I ended up just exporting the audio separately, and fixing it in QuickTime Player. This was not faulty hardware – we’ve come across these problems on multiple machines in multiple facilities. It’s just… well, buggy. Now, please keep in mind, these are rare instances. We export a huge amount of content from Premiere on a weekly basis and it works perfectly – however, the sad fact remains, sometimes (normally with big and complex projects) – something doesn’t play nice.","One thing I loved about FCP7 was that as long as you were working with ProRes files – the timeline was incredibly fast and reliable. When you pressed play – it played. It was never as fast at skimming through the timeline as Avid (probably because we’re always using DNxHD36 files in Avid) – but it was still pretty darn quick. Premiere is even faster… most of the time. Again, it just doesn’t seem to be reliable as FCP7. You press play sometimes, and the audio seems out of sync. You go back and try again, and it works fine. You press play sometimes and it stutters a bit. You press stop, then play again, and it’s fine. For whatever reason, it’s just not quite as “snappy” and reliable as the old FCP despite what people may tell you.","Overall, though, I really like Premiere – and as I said, it’s become my FCP7 replacement – but it still has a long way to go. The trimming tools aren’t as powerful as Avid. You still have to go through a “reconnection dance” when you move a project between machines (although it’s a big improvement on FCP7 – and normally only requires a couple of clicks) – I really wish Premiere had the ability to remember media locations based on the relative location of the project file. The whole Scratch/Media Disk settings – while a lot better than FCP7, are still incredibly annoying. When you open a project that is missing it’s scratch disk locations you get an alert that you have to default the Scratch Disk to your Documents folder and you can’t open the project if you don’t agree. Why won’t it let you tell it where the Scratch Disk actually is (like FCP7)? The waveform cache is also an incredibly frustrating thing – the fact that a video clip will show no waveforms at all until the previews are generated can be a bit of a shock if you’re expecting to see audio along with your video straight after you import it. When you open a really large project, just waiting for all the waveform’s to “reconnect” can also delay things a few seconds or more. One strange thing I’ve noticed is that if you drag the same audio into two separate Premiere projects – it will actually create two waveform files. Why it can’t “share” the file seems a bit strange. It also occasionally “unexpectedly quit’s” when you quit the application – no idea why. Searching, finding and filtering of media is useless and incredibly slow. Imported sequences will sometimes create duplicate master clips even when the clips are already in the project (sometimes it works great – sometimes it doesn’t). Moving a project between a Mac and a PC SHOULD work fine – but it doesn’t – sometimes you simply can’t open a Mac project on a PC. None of these are show-stoppers, but it just goes to show that Adobe still has a long way to go…","As far as I’m concerned, FCP7 is now officially in retirement after many years of faithful service, and Premiere CC has taken over it’s duties. Avid is one of those grumpy old employees that’s been around so long that no ones dares to replace him/her – because he/her holds so much knowledge and experience. Of course there are others – Lightworks 11, Vegas Pro 12 and EDIUS Pro 7 – but at this stage, they all require a PC, which is out of the question for a lot of editors for many reasons. Autodesk Smoke (on Mac) is another possibility – but is has a steep learning curve, and is really designed for people who are doing a complete offline to delivery workflow (including complex visual effects). Smoke is extremely powerful, and if you have the time to learn it properly it can be an amazing tool to have in your arsenal. But despite what Autodesk might tell you, it’s not exactly a suitable substitute for Premiere, Avid or FCP. Yes, you can do editing with it – but the tools aren’t really designed for traditional offline editing. It’s a high-end finishing tool. If you’re a one-person-show, then it could be the perfect solution for your cutting needs – but if we’re talking TVCs, features films and television (which normally means multiple editor and assistant editors), then it’s not the best tool for the job.","The main problem with Avid, Premiere, FCP7 and Smoke for that matter is that they’re all based on very old code. I’m pretty confident there’s still code in Media Composer 7 that came from the original 2.5 release back in June 2006 (although that said, I wouldn’t even be surprised if the Animatte is still using lines from the original 1998 code)! Although Adobe did some major changes behind the scenes with Premiere in the last couple of years – that was still in the last couple of years, and a lot has changed on the Mac platform since then. Sorry Autodesk, but Smoke on Mac is a hack job at best. None of these tools were written specifically for the hardware and operating systems of today.","And so now we finally move onto the whole point of this blog post…"]},{"l":"FCPX","p":["Re-thinking and re-writing the whole Final Cut Pro application from scratch was a massive undertaking that was always going to annoy a lot of people. This is something that Avid and Adobe would never and probably WILL never have the opportunity to do because their whole business model relies on selling software. Apple’s ProApp’s are almost a hobby to them – they don’t make a huge amount of money (compared to iPhone’s and iPad’s), and they don’t really sell that much hardware (compared to iMovie and the 99c FaceTime) – but they’re still important because they encourage other software manufacturers to keep competing in the Mac space. Every time Apple releases a ProApp update, you can see that competing developers definitely take note and improve upon their own products. Adobe is definitely watching Apple very, very closely.","One of the main reasons FCPX is so exciting is because it’s based on completely new and modern code. It’s entirely 64-bit (meaning it can use all the RAM in your system – something FCP7 could never do), it’s built with Apple’s Cocoa framework (meaning it can make use of all the latest functions the operating system supports), it makes great use of your GPUs (including the multiple GPUs in the new MacPro), it uses modern interface technologies such as Core Animation (which means even the UI elements can be GPU accelerated), 3rd party plugins can make use of 64-bit processing and GPU acceleration (through FxPlug 3), it has a proper ColorSync-managed pipeline (meaning files will look identical between FCPX, Motion, QuickTime Player, etc.), it does all it’s image processing in a floating-point linear-light colour space, and it has native format support for all of the most popular shooting formats (such as R3D, XAVC, AVCHD, H.264, AVC‑Intra, etc.). OK… so it’s modern code, I get it – but why do I as a creative editor care at all about these geeky details? Simple – it makes things fast, and it makes things stable. The software is designed to run at it’s absolute best on the hardware of TODAY. There’s no old redundant code lying around to support older systems. Everything can be streamlined. By starting from scratch, and by having a clear direction of where they want the product to go, the developers can build the application in a way that’s easy to grow and maintain. If you look at Avid and FCP7, there are bugs in the most recent versions that have existed there for years and years. Why were they never fixed? Probably because it’s too hard to revisit all that old code! I’ve been pushing FCPX pretty hard recently – and to be perfectly honest, it hasn’t crashed once. I can’t say the same thing for Premiere or Media Composer.","FCPX is currently the only modern NLE on the Mac platform. This is exciting."]},{"l":"My First Project","p":["01 – Cuts 02 – Rushes 03 – Audio 04 – Graphics","Cail Young (over at Inspiration Studios) has been bugging me to properly test FCPX for ages. He gave me a great demonstration of an earlier version when he was cutting a feature film on it a while back – and although I was impressed and I could see the potential, I didn’t think it was quite ready for prime time – especially with big projects. In my opinion the recent 10.1 release is the first release where it can be really taken seriously, so when that came out, and the reviews were good (and with Cail always in my ear telling me to give it a go!), I decided to take the plunge and use it on a ‘proper’ job. This also meant I needed to upgrade to Mavericks – which I’ve been holding off for as long as possible in fear that it would destroy Apple Mail.","For this particular project, all of the interviews were in a different language, with a rough translation given at the end of the interviewees answer. Although I would be getting everything properly translated and subtitled, due to the tight deadline, initially I just marked at in-point at the start of the interview, then an out-point at the end of the translation, applied a keyword with the interviewees name and their job description in brackets, then marked the actual interview as a favourite so that I can easily see where the interview ends and the translation begins (although in retrospect, I should have probably have just used markers).","I created a new Library with our internal code code (i.e. LNF-J10001 – Job Name), then created a new Event with the month and year (January 2014). My reasoning for this is that if the job ever resurfaces later down the line, I can keep the same job code, and just create a new Event for the revised projects and any new media – keeping things nice and organised. Apple’s white-paper suggests using a Event for each shoot day, then a separate event for Projects – but I think this just makes things more time consuming personally when you’re digging through footage. Much simpler to just have everything in the one Event, and organise by Folders and Collections.","I then created Keyword Collections (CMD+SHIFT+K) in place of bins (for example, I created a Keyword Collection called ‘Music’ and put it in the ’03 – Audio’ folder).","In terms of actual cutting – I found FCPX made me go back to basic’s and do things a bit differently than I’m used to in Avid and Premiere. In a nutshell… I’d basically have a temporary Project called ‘Review’ and I’d copy and paste an interview (along with subtitles) into the Project, I’d then go through and make selects and delete anything I was sure I wouldn’t use. I’d do this for all the interviews, and once I had selects of everything, I’d paste it all into a new edit project. I then tried to get the interviews into a logical order that flows nicely, and start applying overlay’s and B-roll. For B-roll, I’d just search for the material I’d want by Keyword Collection, then more often than not, I could visually see all the really good stuff as it’s already marked as a Favourite. If there was specific B-roll footage that related to one of the interviewees – it already had a keyword for the interviewees name, so it was easy to find. I’d try get the in and out point as close as possible in the Browser (using the JKL and arrow keys), and then use the Q key to insert it over the top of the interviews on the primary storyline. Although I had created Compound clips for each interview, I never actually inserted a Compound Clip into the edit – I normally just used these clips when I wanted to go back and skim through and re-watch the interviews – and when I found something I liked, I’d copy and paste from the Compound Clip timeline. For music, I’d just ‘attach’ it to the video on the primary storyline and shift it around when necessary.","In terms of actually cutting, I actually found FCPX pretty easy to get started if you’re used to FCP7. The J, K & L shortcuts are the same, as is SHIFT+Z (Zoom to Fit), the zoom tool (Z), blade tool (B), and hand tool (H). The new ones you need to master are Q (connect the selected clip to the primary storyline), W (insert the selected clip into the primary or selected storyline) and E (append the selected clip to the primary or selected storyline). These are pretty easy to remember – W is in the middle, so it insert’s things in the middle, and E is at the end, so it insert’s things at the end! You’ll also want to use S a lot – this turns on and off the scrubbing, and CMD+4 opens and closes the Inspector (I found that having the Inspector open can slow down the timeline dramatically). The position tool (P) is also really handy, as it allows you to easily trim clips without changing the timing of downstream clips (as it replaces the old position with a gap).","Now, it’s important to note that I’m certainly not a FCPX expert by any stretch of the imagination. I’m VERY new to this application. I didn’t do lots of tutorials or read the manual before jumping in. Sometimes the best way to learn it to just get your hands dirty – so I decided to go in with no real knowledge, and just see how things went. After all, Google’s just a CMD+TAB away, and thanks to an amazing Twitter community, help is never far.","Once everything was logged into Keyword Collections, it was time to start cutting.","Once I had all the media inside FCPX, the next step was to log and organise it. I’ve never actually properly used the Hover Scrub in Premiere – I tried it briefly, but just found it annoying so quickly went back to the traditional Avid-style bin view. However, I really like the Skimmer in FCPX – it’s super fast, and it’s fantastic for logging hours of documentary rushes!","Once you have a Library and Event set up – you’re good to start importing media. In my case I had 780GB’s of 2.8K ProRes 4444 files to bring in. I decided to “Leave files in place”, meaning that internally FCPX will basically just create an alias to these original files, and other than that leave them alone. However, in retrospect, I should have probably just let Apple manage all my media – because now when I move the job between machines, I have to re-link to the media each time. It’s only two clicks – but it’s avoidable (and to be fair, I could ‘Consolidate’ now if I really wanted to). Again, like my Premiere complaint, I wish FCPX was smart enough to search for the media in the last known location relative to the Library – as this would make the relinking process completely automated (maybe we’ll see this in the next release?). Originally, I decided to turn off ‘Create Optimised Media’ and ‘Create Proxy Media’ as I was working with ProRes. However, later down the line, I actually ended up creating proxy media to see if it would speed up the timeline responsiveness – and it did (probably because I was working on slower drives outside of the office). The beautiful thing about FCPX is that you can easily and instantly switch between ‘Optimised/Original’ media and ‘Proxy’ media with the click of a switch, and also generate Proxy media later down the line after you’ve already imported. FCPX keeps track of render files for both. I didn’t bother to ‘Import folders as Keyword Collections’, ‘Analyse for balance colour, ‘Find people’ or ‘Create Smart Collections after Analysis’ – however I did ‘Analyse and fix audio problems’, ‘Separate mono and group stereo audio’ and ‘Remove silent channels’. As I predicted, as soon as you press import, you can instantly start working with the media – and any analysis happens in the background. In my opinion getting media into FCPX and managing it is FAR smarter, similar and faster than any other NLE currently on the market. If/when Apple works out project/media sharing – then it’ll actually be far better than Avid’s current implementation in my opinion.","Overall, I found trimming and re-arranging clips pretty easy – the magnetic timeline is definitely handy for keeping things in sync. The only time I really got “lost” was when I’d make a mistake, and try to undo, but it would undo something else I didn’t want it to, and re-do’ing didn’t put me back in the original location (sadly, the Undo button is useless is a lot of situations as it doesn’t remember everything). Having a magnetic timeline definitely helped keep my subtitles in sync, and overall I actually enjoyed working with it. There were times when I was frustrated (mainly because sometimes it made it work slower than I’m used to) – but I can’t remember any specific examples. I think if the Undo button actually worked as you’d expect, it would have saved me a lot of hassle.","The first time I opened the application – it all seemed pretty logical. First step, create a new Library. This is basically a ‘bundle’ that contains everything – your projects (i.e. timelines/sequences) and media (or alias’ to your media). Funnily enough, this is a concept that I guessed Apple would add to FCP back in early 2009. I’m actually surprised that they didn’t initially release FCPX with this Library functionality – however, I’m GUESSING that they were holding off until Mavericks was released for some reason – I’m sure it was always in the pipeline. The benefit of this is that it just makes life so much easier, as the bundle contains all your projects, media, transcodes, proxies, Stabilisation and Optical Flow analysis, and renders – keeping everything nicely self contained in a single “file” on the Finder level. If you want to store all your media in the ‘bundle’ you can – otherwise, you can just ‘link’ to it (similar to the way Avid’s AMA works). The other nice thing about FCPX is that each project is a separate database file (very similar to Avid). This means that on a Finder level you can easily move projects around if needed – although I probably wouldn’t recommend messing with the bundle contents without some serious testing and experimentation.","The next step was to start logging and organising all the footage. This is where I found FCPX really shines for documentary work. I just opened up the Keyword Editors (CMD+K), and started scrubbing through the footage, adding in and out points (using the traditional I and O keys), then applying Keywords as required (using the CTRL+NUMBER keyboard shortcuts). The great thing is that I can easily apply multiple keywords to selection of clips (for example, ‘Morning’, ‘Fog’ and ‘Slow Motion’) – which helps a huge amount later down the line when you’re trying to find suitable clips. I found this way of working incredibly fast and efficient. Also, if there was any footage I came across during the logging that I knew I’d really want to use, I’d mark it as a ‘Favourite’ (using the F key).","To get things started, I created (CMD+SHIFT+N) the usual folders I would in Avid (or Premiere and FCP7 for that matter):","To organise the sub-titles and translations, I basically created a new Keyword Collection called ‘- Subtitles’ (so it appears at the top of the folder), and created a new Project for each interview. When I finally received the translation documents from our client, all their logging was in Hours:Minutes:Seconds – so I applied a generator on the timeline so that I could easily and quickly see the timecode. Unfortunately FCPX doesn’t currently offer Timecode Overlays – which I hope they can address in the future, so using a generator just makes things a bit easier. I then used a ‘Basic Title’ effect to create the actual subtitles, attaching the titles to the primary storyline video (keeping everything in sync). Once everything was subtitled within the project, I created a Compound clip of the entire timeline for easy access.","Within the ’01 – Cuts’ folder, I’ve basically just created Keyword Collections for each deliverable (i.e. ‘Video 1’, ‘Video 2’, etc.). Within those Keyword Collections I’ve got my individual edits (which FCPX calls “Projects” – using the same projectname_video1_v001 syntax I use in other NLE’s). I know it’s been suggested may times before, but I really wish when you duplicate a project FCPX was smart enough to automatically increase the version number (like After Effects) – maybe next version?"]},{"l":"Things I like","p":["– FCPX is fast, and the timeline playback is smooth. 10.1.1 was released when I was in the middle of cutting my first big project – and it actually made a big different in speed compared to 10.1. There was definitely a noticeable improvement.– FCPX seems incredibly stable. Despite the fact I had a fairly large project with a fair chunk of media, it never crashed or gave me any strange errors.– I really like the media management – it’s simple and effective. FCPX seems to do a really great job of keeping track of media and renders.– The background rendering is actually surprisingly good. I’ve heard of a few people that turn it off as soon as they launch FCPX, but I set it to 60sec, and it’s been fine.– The interface looks modern and is easy on the eyes. FCPX is the only App I’ve actually ever used in Full Screen mode before, and now whenever I’m in FCPX, I’ll only use it in full screen mode. I feel like I’m driving a professional modern tool.– The Show Used Media Ranges option (under the View Menu) is INCREDIBLY helpful. An orange bar will appear under each clip’s used range and an orange check with the word ‘Used’ will appear in each clip’s keyword area. When you have a heap of footage in your job like I did – this makes life so much easier to work out what footage you’ve actually used. If you press CTRL+U, it will also only display unused media in the Browser, which is also pretty handy. However, “Dupe Detect” (like you find in Avid, and an even better implementation in Premiere CC) on the timeline would also be a welcome addition!– I thought I’d hate it, but I actually find the Colour Board pretty quick and easy – it reminds me a lot of Colorista. I wish however there was a way to make the interface a bit bigger, so that I can have Colour, Saturation & Exposure all visible on the same window at any one time, as that would speed things up dramatically (less clicking).– Unlike earlier versions of FCPX, now if you have a clip selected in the timeline, zooming will still occur on the playhead (which it didn’t used to). If you have both the playhead and skimmer in the timeline at different locations, zooming will occur around the skimmer.– You can just press the Delete key to ‘Join Clips’ (which I found a bit scary at first!).– You can open any recently mounted Library from the FCPX dock icon by ‘click-holding’ and selecting the Library from the popup menu.– If you hold down the OPTION key when launching FCPX, you can choose which Libraries you want to open. You also have the option to create a new one. This is really handy if you’re using FCPX regularly and switching between jobs/clients.– The new ‘Blade Speed’ command (SHIFT+B) is pretty handy if you want to apply a speed effect on two different sections of the same clip without actually ‘cutting’ it.– You can use ‘Duplicate Project as Snapshot’ to create a duplicate of your project – but freeze any multi-cam or compound clips you have. Unlike ‘Duplicate Project’, this will essentially break the connection to the original Multicam or Compound Clip, so if you edit these in the new Snapshot timeline, the changes won’t actually affect the original Compound Clip’s or Multicam Clips. Basically, duplicating a project as a snapshot makes copies of the compound or multicam “parent” clips and embeds them in the project (as “ghost” assets that you can’t actually see in the browser) so that any changes to other instances of the clips do not affect the snapshot. As I wasn’t really using Compound Clips or Multicam clips in the timeline, I just duplicated my projects – but I can definitely see the use for snapshots!– FCPX can now share media successfully across standard network drives. I found this out accidentally, as I moved a project from one machine to another in our office, and discovered that FCPX was being REALLY slow – upon further investigation, FCPX has actually relinked to the media across the network, rather than connecting to the locally stored media on another drive!– The Trim Commands (Trim Start, Trim End, Trim to Playhead) are very useful. ‘The Trim to Playhead’ command does different things depending on where the playhead is – if it’s in the first half of a clip, it trims the start to the playhead, if it’s in the second half, it trims the end to the playhead. If you use the Range tool to select a range in a timeline clip, the command turns into the ‘Trim Selection’ tool, trimming the clip to match the selection.– If you hold down the COMMAND+OPTION keys, and click a connected clip (or the grey border of a storyline) at the point where you want to position the connection point, the connection point is moved to the point where you clicked. Another handy tip is if you need to move or trim clips in the primary storyline but want to keep any connected clips where they are, you can hold down the Grave Accent (`) key while editing to preserve the timing and position of connected clips."]},{"i":"things-that-needs-improving","l":"THINGS THAT NEEDS IMPROVING:","p":["– FCPX seems to have one of the most forgetful and unhelpful undo functions of any other application. There have been countless times where I will have accidentally have done something, then pressed CMD+Z only for it to do something that I changed a few moves back, forcing me to re-do and completely loose my place in the edit. The undo function really needs to ‘track’ with you, so if you do something at the end of the timeline, then undo – the playhead should be in the exact same spot as you last left it. Every function should be able to be un-done. At the moment it’s anyone’s guess as to what we’ll undo or not, and it gets confusing! Premiere’s History functionality would also be a nice addition.– I would love the ability to be able to just “swipe” to reveal the Inspector (like you can do in Smoke/Flame) – that would speed things up considerably for me.– Audio transitions and mixing are a complete pain at the moment. In FCP7 I’m used to being able to quickly and easily apply transitions between audio clips without any issues. In FCPX it’s a real pain. What I think Apple needs to do is bring a “Clip Mixer” into FCPX (similar to Premiere – AU plugin inserts and keyframe recording would be a bonus), and also allow you to easily apply audio-only transitions. Yes, there are 3rd party workarounds– but they’re still slow workarounds to such a simple problem. My current workflow at the moment is to ‘Expand Audio Components’ (CTRL+OPTION+S), then drag out the audio on the top and tail, then use the mouse to fade in and out the audio – it works – it’s just annoying. A keyboard shortcut to add a default audio fade to a selected audio edit point would speed things up a lot! Another annoying thing is that if you try to add a dissolve to an audio clip – it will automatically place that audio clip into a secondary storyline – it’s a non-issue, but why does a dissolve HAVE to live within a secondary storyline?– It would be awesome if FCPX could remember individual view settings for each Keyword collection. For example, I only want to view my Cuts collections in ‘List View’ but I want to view all my Rushes collections in ‘Filmstrip View’. Again, this would save me a lot of mouse clicks!– Collaborations between editors still needs work. I’m hopeful that one day FCPX will offer Avid-like project sharing – meaning multiple editors can work on the exact same project at the exact same time. Given that they written Guards into the code, and they’ve already patented similar technology – hopefully this will see the light of day sooner rather than later. I’ve love the ability to just right click on a Keyword Selection or Project and select “Push to iCloud”, and then the asset is automatically pushed out to other users with the same project. I think iCloud is the future (much the same as Adobe Anywhere) – but given that Apple still haven’t mastered Calendar sharing, I’m not sure how far away this will be.– Currently there is no way to select all clips to the right or left (i.e. like the Track Select Tool in Premiere). Although the magnetic timeline means you don’t have to use this functionality as much as you could in FCP7, I still found myself wanting that feature a couple of times whilst editing.– The ‘Reveal in Browser’ (aka Match Frame – SHIFT+F) function is a bit annoying. Ideally it should match back to the Keyword Collection that was active when the media was originally inserted into the timeline and not just the main Event folder. It would also be great if it automatically applied a filter so that the ONLY clip in the browser was the clip you’re match framing – so that you can easily find the clip you’re after (either that or highlight it a bit better – maybe make every clip EXCEPT the one you want opaque?) – of course, you could just clear the filters if you want to see where the clip sits in the larger Keyword Collection. At the moment when you match frame something, you have to look really hard and carefully to see where that clip actually lives in the browser.– It would be really handy if the Keywords Editor had a toggle to display ALL the keywords currently used in the Library, so that you can easily drag and drop Keywords into the keyboard shortcuts.– Project timelines can not be scrubbed in the Browser, but Compound Clip timelines can be scrubbed. It would be nice if you could scrub both.– The ability to save and recall customised Window Layouts would be handy.– The Timeline History arrows make absolutely no sense at all. I wish there was just one button that allowed you to access recently opened timelines, and also the option to “close” timelines that you’re no longer using (and don’t want visible in the drop down list). Or just go back to the good old days of tabs (given that even Finder has them now)!– It would be really handy if you could attach a clip to a secondary storyline. This would be great for times when you need to add subtitles to a secondary storyline item for example. Obviously there are workarounds (i.e. you could just put the subtitle in a compound clip) – but I can still think it would be handy to be able to attach a clip anywhere you want.– It would be great if there was a ‘Reveal Affiliated clips in the Timeline’ function (so that you can apply an effect to all clips from the same source file) or better yet, the ability to apply effects to roles. Roles have so much potential – I could love the ability to change specific attributes of generators belonging to a certain role for example (i.e. adjust font of all English subtitles).– Avid has the best Metadata “Readers” of any NLE – essentially any bin column can be “burnt” into the image. Given that FCPX is the “king” of metadata – it would be fantastic if we could actually use this data in the form of a generator (i.e. “burn” timecode, filename and even keywords into the image for rushes exports, etc.).– It would be great if you could drag and effect (or a bunch of effects) from the Inspector to the timeline.– One of the most commonly requested things I’ve heard of, is the ability to “lock” a clip in place in a storyline (i.e. if you know you need something to happen at an exact timecode reference) – this would be really handy."]},{"l":"CONCLUSION","p":["It’s still very early days for me with working with FCPX – I still haven’t used Multicam properly yet, I haven’t used Compound Clips the way they were supposed to be used, and I haven’t made use of Auditions. I also haven’t cut a short film on it yet – or anything that requires major audio work. However, the limited time I have spent with it – I have to say it’s really fun to work with, and has a huge amount of potential. Really, the only thing that’s really annoying in the current release is the way it handles audio editing/mixing.","When I talk to other editors, one of the biggest misconceptions is that FCPX is a “walled garden” – and it doesn’t play nicely with other application. This couldn’t be further from the truth!","DaVinci Resolve 10.1 currently can handle FCPX’s FCPXML much better than FCP7’s traditional XML, with a lot more features being translated correctly between apps, making round tripping an absolute breeze. Blackmagic started supporting FCPXML pretty much as soon as FCPX had the ability to export FCPXML.","Autodesk Smoke/Flame/Lustre can also handle FCPXML on both the Mac and Linux platforms.","ClipExporter(a free 3rd party plugin) opens exported Final Cut Pro X projects (FCPXML) and exports each clip as a Quicktime (reference) movie, Nuke file or Syntheyes importable file. It also exports whole timelines (or just parts of it) to After Effects by translating all edits and many parameters. All clips can be extended by a certain number of handle frames. ClipExporter keeps your post-production workflow organised by creating a shot based folder structure with customizable subfolders.","You can also use Xto7(AUD$50 3rd party plugin) to export a FCP7 XML which you could use to bring a timeline to FCP7, Color, Premiere or After Effects.","X2Pro Audio Convert(AUD$149.99) is a conversion application for delivering FCPX projects to Avid Pro Tools for audio finishing.","There are lots of solid workflows, and given how cheap FCPX is – it still works out far cheaper to buy FCPX and these 3rd party plugins than it ever was to buy FCP7!","FCPX isn’t right for everyone or every workflow. But there’s no debating that it’s a serious high end tool. Once you get used to it, Premiere CC, Media Composer 7, and FCP7 feel like old toys. Avid is still king for long form (well… until Apple or Adobe can solve project/media sharing) – and I’d still use Premiere for anything that I used to use FCP7 for (i.e. jobs with short turnarounds and where you’re doing grade and effects in-house) – but FCPX has it’s place, and it’s getting better and better. Lots of people worldwide are using it for SERIOUS work.","Will I be cutting this years 48 Hour Film Project on FCPX? With 10.1 – no, I doubt it. The audio workflow and colour correction tools are simply too time consuming for a fast paced job – so I think I’ll be sticking with Premiere CC unless Apple releases another update. Will I be cutting other jobs with FCPX? I think for documentary, music videos and anything with serious multi-cam work, then FCPX definitely shines. For anything that requires lots of effects, sound work and “finishing” – then Premiere CC will just make your life easier (especially if you need to send things to After Effects and Adobe Audition). But for big narrative jobs (i.e. feature films and television), my preference would still be to work in Media Composer, because I know it can handle large amounts of media with ease, and if I’m working in a Unity/ISIS environment – I can have multiple editors and assistants working on the same project at the same time. I think with 10.1.1, FCPX now has the ability to safely manage these massive projects from a technical perspective if you’re a standalone editor – but it lacks the tools you need for serious offline editing of a really massive project. At the end of the day, all these software packages are just tools to get the job done – and I’ll use whatever solution will get me the best results.","If you’re interested in learning more about FCPX – I highly recommend checking out the FCPX Grill podcast and the Final Cut Pro X Master list.","End of rant."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Documentary Translation Workflow","p":["This Guest Blog has been written by our good friend, Joel Sharpe. Enjoy!","In this post I’m going to explain my process working with translation on a recent film I did for NGO As Green As It Gets in Guatemala. Like most documentarians, having very little budget to deal with means creating a workflow that requires as little time with a paid translator as possible. Here is how I dealt with it.","Disclaimer: I came into the project with three months worth of one on one Spanish classes under my belt and I cannot emphasise enough the huge advantage of having done this. You’ll see in my steps below that knowing even a little bit of the language went a very long way. I found that the best way to learn is one on one with a teacher (lessons are often available via Skype) at very low cost. Or a good starting point I found is with Duolingo.","2014012401","When filming interviews I always had with me either a translator or somebody from AGAIG that would lead the interview. It was recommended to me before hand to actually have the translator do on the spot translations when the subject finished talking so that I’d have some on camera translations to follow. If you don’t know the language I’d definitely recommend this. Instead, I decided to let the interviews flow naturally without a break for translation. I found that it made the interviews more relaxed, especially when discussing harder issues.","When sitting down to edit, I found that my spanish was adequate enough to do a rough first pass selecting as much relevant content as possible. If you capture on camera translations you can do the same. In Avid I marked all the moments I thought were relevant, added notes on what I thought they were talking about and placed these selects into a new timeline. I narrowed down 1.5 hours of interviews to 30mins. Or effectively hours of work for a translator.","2014012402","I then sat down with a translator who firstly explained exactly what the subjects were talking about and then roughly translated those segments into text form. This helped me to narrow down the selects even further and remove segments that were less eloquent than desired before the translator spent time putting it down on paper.","2014012403","Using the text I sorted segments into the topics I wanted to cover by colour coding . This gave me my basic structure which I worked down until it effectively became a usable paper edit.","2014012404","2014012405","The next step was to get it to work on screen, which as always takes a little bit of massaging. Again, with a little bit of Spanish the whole process was made easier, being able to follow along with the translations without a need for subtitles made editing fast. After that it was cutting as per usual and adding in subtitles to get the whole thing working for an English speaking audience.","The last step was to bring the translator back in to do final corrections and make translation decisions based on the context of the edit. In my opinion I think this step is really important. Language is crucial especially when people are going to follow along mostly by reading and hearing with less time to focus on the cinematography. The words should be well chosen and capture the true essence of what message you are trying to convey. A good translator will come up with great solutions and think of things you’d never have taken into consideration, like choosing words and phrases that all english speaking audiences will understand.","So, that’s how I dealt with translation on a limited budget. I hope that this helps anyone facing similar hurdles. What have you learnt from this workflow and what tips can you offer yourself?"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"year-in-review-2013--part-3","l":"Year In Review 2013 – Part 3"},{"l":"September","p":["Woody Allen’s possible “loose retelling” of A Streetcar Named Desire starring a perfect cast consisting of award worthy performances by Sally Hawkins and Cate Blanchett and featuring a strong support cast with the likes of Bobby Cannavale, Alec Baldwin and Louis CK?

Shot in a set built by a small team in The Magic Sound Company studios in Yarraville and also out on location in Heathcote, shooting took place over four days and looked a little something like this:","02 03 04","Rocketman was the next cab off the rank and a daunting one at that. The script, written by my good friend Phil Enchelmaier from a story I dreamed up one morning over coffee, featured two young boys building a rocketship that, by the end of the film, would actually take off. Shooting late September, the beginning of the month saw Chris and myself team up with our production designer Nathan Wentworth to build a 7 foot rocket (designed by the amazingly talented and absolutely lovely Nidhi Chanani) that was to be lifted up against a green screen at the Showtech offices in Braeside (massive thanks to Tiny & Robyn!), with pyro supplied by Allan Spiegel. The film was set in the 80’s and therefore I wanted to do as much in camera as possible which made for a very exciting day one of the shoot…","05","All in all the shoot couldn’t have gone any better if we tried. The production and costume design by Nato and Elissa Hullah were incredible considering the short time frame and small budget, the images from cinematographer Ben Hidalgo were some of the best we’ve seen on a LateNite project and the performances from our cast (young and old) were second to none. We have always been very blessed at LateNite to have such an amazing team and this was no exception – to everybody involved, I thank you with all my heart!","06","And so with a rapidly closing deadline for both Time Trap and Rocketman, we all began busting our balls to get them finished. Hocking, working simultaneously between the two as Shanks continued with the enormous amount of visual effects on Time Trap and me working with Mike Lutman to lock an edit on Rocketman."]},{"l":"October","p":["I think if I had’ve put up anything other than Gravity for this month I would have been ripped to shreds by most people and why the hell not I say, Gravity was without fail one of the best films of 2013. The cinematography, sound design and spectacle are all reasons for a hell of a lot of nominations come award season. If you haven’t seen this film on the biggest damn screen you can then you are quite simply a maniac!","07","Anyway after weeks and weeks of everybody going above and beyond on our two shorts including our Time Trap sound designer/composer Craig Jansson(who was also simultaneously doing sound design and music on Jacqui’s TVC for Ogivly and the National Environment Agency of Singapore), Rocketman sound designer Sasha Zastavnikovic, Composer Paul Dawkins and VFX artist Eugene Richards, we finally finished both films and sent them on their way to festivals. With everybody suitably exhausted and ready for a break what else should occur than Chris’ favourite weekend of the whole year. The 48 Hour Film Project.","Now to be honest, after literally finishing Rocketman 3 or 4 hours before the festival started, Chris and I seriously considered pulling out of the competition. We were exhausted, destroyed, on our last legs, however you want to put it – we were not overly keen on making another film in the space of 48 hours and not sleeping after already spending the last month barely sleeping. But with a lot of first timers and enthusiasm on our side (including Nathan Wentworth, Tegan Higginbotham, Daniel Daperis and Elissa Hullah) we decided, what the hell. It’s only one more weekend right?","08","So with Horror as our genre, and after Nato and my “Killer Turkey” idea got shut down, off we went on the Friday night to start shooting our fifth 48 hour film festival entry with Dan and myself directing and acting alongside Nato, Tegan, Lelda and one of the stars of Rocketman, little Rory MacKenzie.","I gotta say this was my favourite of the films that we’ve done for the 48 hour over the years. It was such a pleasure working alongside a team that were just so excited to be creating something together in 48 hours and who were willing to do anything to make not just a great 48 hour film, but a great film! I did learn one enormous lesson though – trying to scare people is bloody hard when you know when the scares are coming. I found it near impossible to work out whether the film was scary or not. Alas with the film making it in comfortably on time, we had to play the waiting game to see if our film would indeed make the audience jump out of their seats like we hoped.","As usual, half way across the globe, Jacqui was busy working with Gone Adventurin’, covering a bike ride from Ankor Wat in Cambodia, through Thailand and ending in Vientiane in Laos. It was a project that managed to raise over 102,000 USD to end avoidable blindness through the initiative Seeing Is Believing. Amazing girl that Jacqui!"]},{"l":"November","p":["How does one take a famous tween novel and not completely screw it up like those lovely fellow’s behind the abomination that is Twilight. It seems you take a great series of novels, trust the drama, add brilliant actors including one very strong female hero in Jennifer Lawrence, add a touch of violence, shake and serve. The first Hunger Games film very much impressed me and this one was no different. A really fantastic tale littered with good performances, some amazing set pieces and a riveting story. Fantastic thinkers popcorn movie!","So with the craziness of the previous two months now done and dusted it was back to the development drawing board as we tried to catch our breath. Jacqui returned with the Gone Adventurin’ crew to do a meet and greet with myself and Chris and exciting young creatives were using the LateNite space to explore their projects. I also began my directors attachment on the high rating ABC show The Doctor Blake Mysteries which stars Craig Machlachlan. I was attached to an incredible director by the name of Ian Barry and you can read all about my time on the show here.","And then came the big one. The 48 hour awards night in which we would discover whether our film was actually the scary horror film that we set out to make. With such a strong field this year, we all agreed that regardless of the outcome, we were amazingly happy with the film we’d made. There was a very strong audience reaction to Flash(probably the strongest one of our films has had in the festival) which made us all feel very proud of what we’d created.","What happened next surprised us all quite a bit. We took out the awards for Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Director, Best Film AND the Audience Award. The film now goes on to compete in New Orleans in March at the International 48 hour film festival along with 100 other films from around the globe. A huge thank you to the Melbourne 48 hour team and all the other teams that competed. There were so many amazing films this year and we all feel very fortunate to have come away with what we did!","09"]},{"l":"December","p":["I’m not going to lie to you. I was a wee bit “meh” about David O Russell’s latest offering. The performances (like in all of his films) were absolutely stunning but I felt the story for such a simple premise was a little convoluted. I have picked this one though cause the month of December has been slim pickings for my movie going so it’s the best I got!","And now we find ourselves in December. Never staying in the same place for more than a few weeks – Jacqui headed off to West Java to film for “The Learning Farm” – a project which helps troubled youth and street kids from all over Indonesia transform their lives through organic farming and life skills.","For the rest of us, with our enormous year coming to a close we have spent most of December getting ready to launch into next year, with all guns blazing. We have (finally) updated our website and showreel and have sat down with our LateNite team to discuss our plan of attack for next year. And let me tell you, if our end of year planning meeting was anything to go by, next year is going to be HUGE.","So to everybody that has supported us, helped us and become a part of the LateNite family in the last 12 months, we honestly cannot express our gratitude enough. You have been what keeps us going when times have gotten tough and are the drive for us to keep getting bigger and better.","2014 is going to be a big year for us and we hope you all come along for the ride.","Have a great New Years and we will see you all in 2014!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"year-in-review-2013--part-2","l":"Year In Review 2013 – Part 2"},{"l":"May","p":["01","02","03","And lastly was Nebraska, from one of my favourite directors Alexander Payne (who I spied from a distance in a screening of French film Le Passe, another favourite). The film, although probably a touch long, is a really beautiful story about a father and son roadtrip that gets sidetracked at the fathers small home town in Nebraska. Worth seeing just for the star turn by veteran actor Bruce Dern.","And what about that handsome Shanks devil? Well he had a pretty quiet month by his standards. Just spoke at a talk for the Australian Screen Editors Guild and won Best Independent Music Video at St Kilda Film Fest for a second year running with this beauty:","Anyway I was lucky enough to see a bunch of movies there, the best of which I shall highlight for you below:","Don’t worry, this isn’t going to be a “Nick’s greatest hits of Europe” slide night, but more like a couple of relevant, choice experiences from my travels. Firstly, in London I was lucky enough to see a bunch of shows on the West End. The first one I managed to catch was the Book of Mormon by Trey Parker and Matt Stone who are those talented fellows behind South Park. The thing I love about these guys is their incredible ability to make searing satire from the most politically incorrect of places. The musical is loud, crass and deliciously incorrect but has a heart and message underneath the surface that is as important as your local arthouse offering down at the ye olde cinemaplex. If you’re in London or New York I highly suggest you go and check it out. The other two shows I saw that I think are worth mentioning are Peter and Alice, written by Academy Award winner John Logan (Gladiator, Skyfall) and starring Skyfall’s Ben Whishaw & Judy Dench and The Cripple of Inishmaan, written by another Academy Award winning writer and director in Martin McDonagh (In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths) and starring Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe. Firstly, they were both phenomenal shows. McDonagh is my favourite playwright and can honestly do no wrong and this was John Logan’s next stage offering after the Tony Award Winning Red.","However, what I want to quickly highlight is the performances. Radcliffe, Whishaw and the cast of both were all out of this world but the points on this occasion go to Judy Dench. I watched as she seamlessly shifted between playing an 80 year old and a 10 year old on stage, with my jaw resting firmly on the ground. She was beautiful, she was emotionally present and she knocked my fucking socks of (…sorry, I told Chris I wouldn’t swear but I think it’s appropriate in this situation).","Inside Llewyn Davis is a MUST SEE when it gets released in Jan – one of the Cohen’s best. A beautifully nuanced film about music and art.","Like I said…not a big month for him!","Meanwhile, whilst Jacqui was still sailing the Pacific Ocean and exploring the Galapagos Islands (half her luck), her documentary featuring Hocking #3 (David), was screening in Hong Kong. The screening of Divin’ Timor, supported by Agnes B, was a great success, raising awareness and funds for a Hummingfish Foundation project called Ai Funan.","Moving on to the pièce de résistance of my travels, the Cannes Film Festival was unlike anything I could’ve possibly imagined. It’s funny that you look at these festivals in the press and you expect them to be these amazing glitzy events with red carpet as far as the eye can see and celebrities looking fabulous 24/7. What I got to experience was the business of filmmaking. I had a couple of wanders around the Cannes Film Market where thousands upon thousands of movies were being sold. I observed people having meetings everywhere (I even snuck in one or two), market screenings where filmmakers desperately tried to hold strong as distributers would walk out of their 30 person screening after 10min of watching and each and every country trying to woo and schmooze other countries to come and shoot in their homeland. It was honestly something else and if any filmmakers are reading this I HIGHLY suggest that if you ever plan on trying to sell a film there, go and check it out first when you have nothing to lose!","Over the other side of the world, whilst the others were getting up to their regular shenanigans, I was busy living it up in Europe. I was on the way to my brothers wedding so thought I would “pop in” and see some shows in London and also what all the fuss is about at the Cannes Film Festival.","Shortly after one of these days, I managed to squeeze in a Skype call to help out the LateNite team as they attempted their first ever 48 EcoFilm Challenge. Both Mike Lutman and Chris sounded a bit broken so myself and my lovely girlfriend Lelda came to the rescue to the poor sleepless guys back at LateNite. Meanwhile, halfway across the world, Jacqui thought she’d also make an attempt at the 48 hour whilst on her documentary shoot with the TopToTop project. Both films made it in on time but unfortunately a blunder with one of the line’s made LateNite Team A disqualified.","The Immigrant was another personal favourite, probably more because we watched the press conference immediately after the film with director James Gray and some of the cast. It was a fascinating insight into why he wanted to make the film which you can watch here.","The month started with me heading off overseas on an adventure to my brothers wedding (and a side trip to London and Cannes Film Festival – more on that later) and the boys shooting another one of Shanks’ creations. The mockumentary style clip was the first of the Timtimfed collection which features dialogue. You can view below:","There is no better place to learn about building a sustainable film and television industry than Denmark. Those clever Danish folk have continued to build and shape their industry over many years to a point where 30% of the box office share is coming from homegrown Danish cinema and their number #1 film for 2013 in terms of box office takings was a Danish film. Compare that to the Australian box office share which hasn’t hit above 10% in the last 25 years and you could say there is a thing or two we could learn from the Danish. Anyhoo, that aside, The Hunt is without a doubt one of the best films of 2013. Directed by Thomas Vinterberg, The Hunt is a beautifully crafted film which will have you shaking from anger by the end of it. It had a similar effect on me as last year’s Academy Award winning film In A Better World (also Danish) which was directed by Susanne Bier. Go and see it if you haven’t, it’s a very important film!","We are ENORMOUSLY proud of both films and couldn’t have done it without the hard work of the usual suspects and the added director awesome that is Mike Lutman. You can all have a cheeky look at both below:"]},{"l":"June","p":["It was a pretty lacklustre US Summer Season this year with a bunch of non event blockbusters released. I know Shanks will disagree but I actually didn’t mind World War Z in comparison to a lot of the other releases. The ending was a bit bullshit and the product placement was a touch absurd (the scene with the Pepsi machine well worth a mention) but otherwise it was a good fun popcorn movie.","Anyway onto June and my glorious return to welcome LateNite newcomer Daniel Daperis who had been working with Chris whilst I was away. Dan is the brother of Jared Daperis who I have known for many years after we were in a kid’s tv show together. As well as being an amazing director, Dan is also an incredible actor having started when he was just a wee boy. He is a very exciting newcomer to the team as not only is he very talented, he is a wonderful guy who we are very excited to add alongside Shanks and myself as a LateNite director. Dan in particular was a huge help stepping in as director of our Behind The Scenes work on the ABC/BBC kids series Worst Year of my Life Again…!","04","While the boys were doing their behind the scenes thing, Shanks’ was up to his usual tricks with another one of his timtimfed video’s which was shot on our newly acquired BMC camera. Hocking did a nice little write up for BMC which you can check out here.","The result of Shanks’ genius can be seen below:","With myself returning from overseas it was time to say goodbye to our office in at 16th Street Actors Studio where it all started. We’d like to say a big thank you to Jamie Zamudio and Kim Krejus for allowing us to use their old kitchen as our first ever office! Here are some photos of us moving into our sexy new space in Collingwood! Huge thanks to Mara Kapsis for helping pick all our furniture and design our office space and to Karen Mead for building our main edit desk!","05 07 06"]},{"l":"July","p":["This is the End was a funny movie for a couple of reasons. Number one it was a cleverly written, cameo filled comedy from the minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and number two, it bore a striking resemblance to our 2012 48 Hour Film Festival short To The Heavens.","If you’ve seen the movie have a watch of our short below and let me know what you think. They were shot at the same time so nothing dodgy, just a few funny little coincidences:","July was a slightly quieter month at LateNite with the team working towards some deadlines with our advertising work and also participating in a talk at PAX Melbourne. The talk featured Shanks along with Chris and timtimfed DOP, Sam McCabe, speaking to a packed out audience at the PAX event in Melbourne. Thanks to all the people at PAX for making the event happen and to everyone that came along to hear what the team had to say!","08","July was also the very beginning of my favourite time of year…"]},{"l":"AUGUST","p":["As always when MIFF rolls around I can’t choose just the one film for the month as I saw a shitload. Of the 40 odd films I racked up in the two weeks my favourites were:","Mood Indigo was a really sweet film from the brilliant mind of Michel Gondry. Love him or hate him, the man has an enormous imagination which always makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.","Fruitvale Station was the darling of this years Sundance and a hugely important film for our time. The film is a very subtle, almost voyeuristic look at the shooting of an African American man by a white police officer in the early hours of New Years Day in 2009. Based on a true story this film is a must see.","Valentine Road is the most important documentary of this year. A powerful doc about a 14 year old boy in Oxnard, California who gunned down his classmate Lawrence King who had started cross dressing at school. If you haven’t caught the doco put it down on your must see list.","…and my three absolute favourites:","In lesser hands my gut feeling is that Stoker wouldn’t have been as great a film as it was. Park Chan-wook, the cult director behind the original Oldboy, has taken what I think was possibly a sub standard script by Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller and put his unique spin on it to make it a taut, suspenseful thriller and one of the years best films. Worth seeing just for the production design, cinematography and amazing sound design.","This movie broke my heart. With stunning performances by Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan, Alexander Skarsgard and newcomer Onata Aprile, I challenge you to walk out of this movie without shedding a tear.","Without a doubt one of the best Australian movies of the last 20 years. If any movie is gonna get Australians back into the cinema it should be this one. A beautiful, poignant little film about a young Laotian boy who is thought to be the “unlucky” twin after the other twin dies during child birth. It’s funny, dramatic and just plain beautiful.","So now that we’ve covered that, what else happened this month?","09","Well Shanks had a busy month with his first television commercial shooting late in the month and also he began prep for his first short film outside of the 48 Hour Film Festival entitled Time Trap. Both projects were to be shot by the incredibly talented Ed Goldner who would be making his cinematographer debut on a LateNite project.","I also began work on a Fringe Festival show with John Richards (writer of ABC series Outland) and Lucas Testro (director of Winners & Losers) and started prep with Chris and Daniel another big LateNite short in Rocketman.

Hard because Chris and I both quit our jobs to go full time LateNite and also moved into a brand new office and special because we were lucky enough to add some extraordinarily talented people to the LateNite family and we got to shoot some of our most ambitious projects to date.","So, as always, let’s start at the very beginning with a trailer for my favourite movie released in Jan…"]},{"l":"JANUARY","p":["I’m sure this will be a shock to most as Django was also released in January but Silver Linings was my pick for the month. The thing I love about David O. Russell’s films (even if they do occasionally miss the mark) is that he manages to elicit incredible performances from all of his actors. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were amazing but I personally was blown away by De Niro and strangely enough Chris Tucker. I felt it was De Niro’s best performance in a long long time and I’ve never really rated Tucker at all but in this he is brilliant!","January started off a little quietly for everyone but Jacqui, who began the year with some assisting on Australia’s World Vision 48HR Famine Campaign, shot in Ethiopia by Zerna Films. Then it was back to Singapore, to join Ashwin from Gone Adventurin’(to which LateNite are the official production partner), behind the camera to be interviewed for a Channel News Asia TV Show “Social Inc”.","01","Meanwhile, director Michael Shanks was at it again with another brilliant YouTube video to coincide with the release of the Hitman HD Trilogy video game. Chris went along for the ride as usual along with Timtimfed regulars Sam McCabe, Jackson McInerney and Mark Taylor.","I was busy on the acting side of things shooting with the boys at Dark Heart Productions on their crowd funded TV series The Weatherman. The show has since gone into post production for a release in 2014."]},{"l":"FEBRUARY","p":["There was a whole lotta hate for Cloud Atlas and a whole lotta Academy Award snubs but I have to be honest with you, I really dug this movie. The worlds the Wachowskis continue to create in their movies are outstanding and the production design really blew me away. How they didn’t even get a nod for makeup or VFX is beyond me!","So Feb started with the launch of Love Your Sister, a campaign supported by LateNite and with a doco helmed by our good mate Alistair Marks. The campaign itself is following Samuel Johnson as he rides 15,000k around Australia on his unicycle, raising money and awareness about breast cancer. It is his amazing way of showing support to his sister Connie who is currently dying of Breast cancer. To find out more and donate anything you can head to their website. Jacqui lent her skills and support to the launch of the campaign by hanging out of a helicopter to shoot some amazing footage.","02","Not only was Jacqui back in town to help out on Love Your Sister, but she also had the screening of her doco Cycle on Ceylon, which was made with frequent LateNite collaborator Mike Lutman. You can take a sneak peak at it below:","I spent some of the month attending the Australian Writer’s Guild Conference on the Mornington Peninsula. The biennial event featured speakers from all over the globe including Academy Award winning writer Tom Schulman and writer of the hit Channel 4 series Shameless, Paul Abbott. To read more about my time at the conference you can look back on my blog entries here.","Other shoots to occur this month were a promo video with trucks as far as the eye could see for trucking company Magic Logistics as well as the beginnings of a music video for well-known metal band 12 Foot Ninja.

The film was to be shot in Melbourne, LA, Albania and Mexico in July/August so I was back and forthing with the LA production team to get everything prepped for the shoot.","In amongst the prep I also found time to work on a very special project for the LateNite team. In association with SEEK and SEEK Learning we were fortunate enough to be part of their video for the It Gets Better Project. For those of you that are not aware, the It Gets Better Project’s mission is to communicate to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth around the world that it gets better, and to create and inspire the changes needed to make it better for them. We spent a day hearing the stories of some very beautiful and brave soul’s that work for SEEK and SEEK Learning and you can see their stories below:","Jacqui, meanwhile, was flying to the Amazon in Brazil to film once again for the carbon offset company MyClimate. After an incredible shoot, Jac flew on to Panama to continue her epic coverage of the TOPtoTOP Global Climate Expedition documentary. It’s quite amazing to think this is the 5th year of filming this project - which, according to Jacqui, will hopefully become an interactive and feature length project by 2020.","The end of the month saw Chris take off to shoot with our good friend Dave Christison on his Flickerfest selected short film MAN."]},{"l":"APRIL","p":["I have to admit, again this wasn’t my favourite movie in the whole wide world but I did really like the concept, even if it was a little sickly sweet!","So with Jacqui overseas (shooting on Coco’s Island, otherwise known as Isla Nublar from Jurassic Park!!) and myself and Shanks twiddling our thumbs in Melbourne, Chris was off in WA shooting on MAN, a short film that explores the underbelly of Australia’s regional drug epidemic and tackles the universal theme of what it means to be a man.

And like always, doing this through the spirit of Adventure!","It was a wonderful idea: try encourage all Singaporeans to “Keep Singapore Clean” – very simple. To do this, we wanted to show the different landscapes and beautiful waterways of Singapore, and the affect that rubbish has on the environment.","It’s funny when people ask me about Singapore. They are often surprised when I tell them it’s my favourite city in the world, and without a doubt, it really is.","One of those heroes – is Eugene.","Since our Spinning Dreams (in Timor-Leste) Film in 2010 – Ashwin and I have worked together tirelessly together to create important Documentaries which inspire others. Four massive projects later in 4 countries around Asia, and over SG$100,000 raised for our causes, we created our first community message specifically directed to speak to the heart of local Singaporeans.","The National Environment Agency had concerns that some locals were not aware of the severe impact plastic and littering had on our environment. They wanted to create a community message to educate the masses, evoke a sense of pride and congratulate those who are already dedicating their life to Keeping Singapore Clean.","The scope of the film project was large, so it was a great chance to work with some different freelancers to make the film. The artistic and creative talent in Singapore is unbelievable – raw and terribly exciting to be apart of. SG truly is the hub of Asia, not only geographically, but an important hub for creative and innovative people from all over the world!","The shoot was made even more rewarding working with such fun and talented crew, and despite heavy (sporadic) rain on two of the shoots days, we still worked through it all!","The style of Art, Music and Film Singapore creates has strong influences from all over the world, but with a VERY unique Singaporean story to tell.","There are so many places of environmental beauty in Singapore, it’s impossible to ignore.

I was in awe of his commitment and love for Kallang Waterways – the most popular waterway for activities such as dragon boating.","Therefore, the only way forward, I see, is through urban national parks. Environments where humans and wildlife can not only live but thrive in harmony. People overseas often think Singapore is nothing but a corporate megalopolis. They couldn’t be more wrong.

We drove with the CEO of Precious Woods into an area which in 1997 had been harvested. I braced myself, as any form of forest harvesting I thought would be heartbreaking. But I couldn’t believe it.","As always apon arrival – I unpack everything. I make sure everything is charged or charging, drives and cards are formatted, lens’s are clean & the initial script is finalised in my head. I re-fit everything to fit into an easy-access side bag, so I can carry my entire kit around my neck & waist. The rest I still carry with me, but in a back-pack I can leave with security at the project base. Hard-drives of course stay with my passport, always by my side.","Before the power plant was installed – the city of Itacoatiara relied on diesel to power the city. Not anymore.","BK Energia is a power plant that is fuelled entirely by sustainably managed biomass from an FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified saw mill located right next door. Before the power-plant utilised the waste from the mill (turning it into electricity), it was simply left to rot in stockpiles creating polluting methane. By using the waste, over 45,000 tons of CO2 is reduced from entering the atmosphere every year.","brazil","I had the sync & rough-assemble complete by the end of the shoot, and sent off the longer interviews that needed a more thorough translation. My favourite story was an interview I made with one of the precious woods female employees;","I was especially shocked to see how impressive the filtering process was of the air which is released into the atmosphere after the thermal processing. Check it out:","I’m proud, very proud to work for this company. It’s an honour to have a company like this working in the amazon.","It was hard to see any evidence of human activity – the forest area had regenerated incredibly and was lush with life. I was amazed to find out that actually the forest growth is faster in the managed areas. For monitoring purposes though, Precious Woods still keeps large sections of the forest completely untouched – to have a comparison & study of their managed areas. They want to make sure nothing they do is detrimental to the eco-system or wildlife, and therefore carefully assess the progress of their work. When harvesting an area, they will only select specific trees & species to harvest – keeping as much of the remaining forest intact as possible. They keep a comprehensive catalog of EVERY TREE in their area, including the age & growth rate.","It was the first time I had visited a biomass energy plant, and I was impressed by all the stories we found.","Itacoatiara is about a 7 hour journey from the main city of Manaus. So we didn’t have much time to check out the city, instead we hired a car and got moving. I was super keen to get deeper into the “jungle” and was getting even more intrigued about the project I was preparing to film.","Martin from my climate was awesome, and we spent the evening going over the script and actually recording some voiceover using a Sennheisser lapel into a handy little H4N, just to make sure we had all our bases covered.","Monday night we got rained out which was pretty stressful, with such a tight deadline & shooting schedule, I needed to be filming every moment I had. Luckily the weather subsided and I managed to miss most of the downpour on the first shooting day as we made our way from the hotel to “BK Energia Power Plant”.","On the Wednesday night, I did most of the data wrangling and consolidation of script & story. It was information overload in a way, with the FSC managed forest information, the saw mill process, the production of energy – all content that needed to be clear & coherent in a short (3-6minute) delivery. Also, all the interviews were in Portuguese. A quick translation was done on site, although that was also not completely easy to do (on one of the days, I was working closely with an Italien employee of Precious Woods, speaking German, translating Portuguese into English… epic!)","Our schedule was tight – we arrived Sunday, would meet the project the following day, film & edit Tues-Wed, finalise on Thursday, travel & fly out again on Friday.","Similar to the project I filmed in Africa, this was again a “shoot-edit-deliver” turnaround, so I didn’t bring too much gear to worry about, making transport relatively easy. We arrived at a hostel in Manaus later that afternoon & crashed relatively early. Waking up in the tropical air the next day felt awesome, the air still hot & humid. We were served local coffee & fresh fruit from the tropics which was a great start to the day!","The drive up was interesting, it was my first visit to the Amazon, and we stopped a couple of times to chat to some locals with what little Spanish we knew (sadly neither of us spoke much Portuguese!). We thought we must have misunderstood one friend selling oranges on the side of the road, when he said “can I show you my pet?”. 5 minutes later he returned with a python he found in the forest wrapped around his forearm! But eventually we arrived in the colonial-style town of Itacoatiara.","The moment we stepped out of the aeroplane it hit us – even though I spend much of my year in the tropics of Singapore, the thick, hot, humid air here in the Amazon was unlike anything I had ever experienced. The sensation was both incredibly welcoming and borderline suffocating! It was like you had to physically push yourself to walk through it, and it took my lungs a few moments of confusion to realise I was actually breathing – even though each breath felt filled with vapour. Our hostel had arranged a driver to collect us, and as we sat down in his car, the expression on our face must have summoned his first words to us; “Yes. WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE!”","The project replaces several diesel generators and supplies the approximately 80,000 inhabitants of the city with climate-friendly power. Thanks to the power plant, the local population benefits from lower energy prices and a more stable energy supply (less failures and transport losses). Other benefits are the creation of local jobs as well as a better income distribution in the region. The local municipality benefits from lower expenditures as it no longer needs to import diesel or electricity from other regions. These funds can therefore be spent in other critical areas such as health and education. The plant produces annually up to 56,000 mWh of electricity, for which otherwise around 5 million litres of diesel would be consumed.","The saw, called “Precious Woods” is the worlds best example for sustainable forest management. The mill is even approved by Greenpeace, which does audits once a year flying over their managed-forest area.","There are over 60 different species of trees in the forest there, all with unique & beautiful textures, colours & traits, which they export as precious commodity. But because they only export the best quality, there’s a lot of extra waste and “scraps” created during the milling process. These are then dropped into a conveyor belt which connects directly to the energy plant next door.","This time, the destination was Itacoatiara, which resides by the famous Amazon River. I was being sent to film another carbon-offset project, this time a biomass energy plant. The plant, BK Energia, is situated in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest of Brazil.","To everyone in the myclimate team & BK Energia Project, thank you for your precious contribution to our planet.","To get there, I had to fly from LA to Miami, where I met the project partner Martin from myclimate, who had just landed from Switzerland. We travelled together from Miami into the Brazilian Amazonas city of Manaus.","Way back in March this year, I once again had the privilege of filming for the Swiss non-profit organisation myclimate. The more I work with this energetic team, the more respect and admiration I have for their projects.","Well, it was certainly my honour to film such a great example for the rest of the world on how to protect our most precious resource – our rainforests. It is only with this type of sustainable collaboration & social enterprise that local communities & our natural environment can survive.","Win.","You can learn more about the project here."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Hard Drive Challenge","p":["drives","I’ll be honest – I’m a bit of a hoarder and collector. I absolutely love film books, DVDs and all kinds of film gear. Our office, and my home (especially the garage!) is jam packed with all kinds of wonderful film related books, DVDs, BluRay’s, Lights, Grip Gear, Tripod’s, Magic Arm’s, etc.","But the one thing I have more than anything else, is DATA. Although we’ve very organised with LateNite jobs – always having active jobs on two separate RAID5’s in the office, and one standalone drive off-set (then eventually archiving to an on-site and off-site LTO5 tape) – when it comes to personal files over the years, everything just sadly piles up. When I moved out of home many years ago now – I put a whole pile of old hard drives in a box, with the intention to eventually archive anything important (I did have some self control though – and ended up throwing out thousands of floppy disks!). I wouldn’t consider any of this data vital or really important – it’s just random stuff I’ve done over the years (school projects, websites, programming, short films, animations, etc.) that I’ve long forgotten. Most of it is also backed up onto CDs and DVDs that I will probably never actually access that are still sitting in storage somewhere. Because of this, no care or respect has ever been given to these drives – they’ve just been thrown together in boxes, without proper static or moisture protection, and travelled with me as I’ve moved house.","Rather than just destroy all the drives and be done with it – I’ve decided to pull out the old FireWire 400 IDE adapter (and by that I mean dismantle an old hard drive enclosure), and see if any of the drives are still operational – maybe even find some old hidden gems.","There is always lots of discussion on the Internet about the shelf life of hard drives – so this will hopefully offer some insight as a real world example, with lots of different drives from a wide range of generations and era’s stored in pretty average and horrible conditions. We’ve had some stinking hot summers, and some awfully cold winters over the years – so these poor drives have just sat there whilst it’s been snowing outside, and also when there’s been bush fires nearby!","To give you some idea of what limits a hard drives shelf life, the longevity of the data stored on any drive depends on the conditions where it is stored and for how long. For hard drives, there are three main factors: magnetic field breakdown, environmental conditions, and mechanical failure."]},{"l":"Magnetic Field Breakdown","p":["Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~ 69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated – simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues…","To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you’re concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back. There are also Terminal commands on MacOS that allow you to “access” all the files on your hard drive, which makes the hard drive re-write each used block on the hard drive.","You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data."]},{"l":"Environmental Conditions","p":["Some government organizations “sanitise” hard drives by exposing them to a very powerful magnetic field, effectively (and literally) removing the data from the hard drive by “resetting” all of the sectors. It’s important to note that storing a hard drive in, or near the presence of magnetic fields (alternating or static) will severely impact the data stored on the drive.","Geomagnetic storms have also been so powerful in some areas that they have actually corrupted hard disks in the past. If you worry about this issue, consider storing your drives in a basement or somewhere heavily insulated from the environment."]},{"l":"Mechanical Failure","p":["Although not quite as ancient as all these other drives – we also had a bunch of old LaCie enclosures in storage that haven’t been touched for a number of years (most around 4-5 years) containing old University and High School films. The good news? All of these booted up fine without any issues. Although very over priced, we used to love these enclosures because of their triple (USB 2.0, FireWire 400 & FireWire 800) and quad (add eSATA) interfaces – which was great when you’re constantly moving from home and school, where each computer had different interfaces (our old iMac sadly only had FW400). You could buy a couple of these enclosures for current projects, then just go to a local computer store and buy bigger and cheaper internal drives and swap them out – so these enclosures became our “travel cases”. Now days we just use cheap quick release tool-less enclosures – but the LaCie’s still come out occasionally, when we’re working with clients that have ancient machines with only FireWire 400 or 800.","But with all that said and done, let’s fire up some drives and see what happens. I have no idea how old all these drives are, but the capacity should give you some hints!","Compared to conventional long-term storage mediums (tapes, optical discs), the appeal of hard drives is quite apparent – they are small, easy to move around, have very good transfer rates, switch between computers with ease, the data lasts for a fairly long time and they’re cheap! But, like all storage mediums, hard drives do not come without their own caveats. So long as you periodically “refresh” the data on the hard drive (and, in turn, ensure the mechanical aspects of the drive itself are still functioning), you should have no problems.","Depending on the priority of the data you’ve stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn’t take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back.","drive01","drive02","drive03","drive04","drive05","drive06","drive07","drive08","drive09","drive10","drive11","drive12","drive13","drive14","drive15","drive16","drive17","drive18","drive19","drive20","drive21","drive22","drive23","drive24","drivetower","In summary – most of the drives that we had sitting in storage surprisingly actually seemed to work fine. Sadly most of the really old drives (i.e. under 250MB) wouldn’t mount on my iMac – but that’s just a limitation of the hard drive enclosure I was using. Although I’m sure a lot of people have come across the issue of older hard drive enclosures only being able to access 2.2TB of data contained within a 3TB drive – I doubt many people come across the opposite problem (i.e. the drive actually being TOO SMALL for the enclosure to handle). I’m fairly confident, if I was able to dig up an old PC, these drives would have worked fine – but for my purposes, I doubt there’s anything I desperately need stored within a 40MB drive! The fact that they were recognised by the machine at all was good enough for me. Admittedly, if I wanted to be really scientific, I would have done a scan of the whole drive to try and detect any corrupt files or bad blocks – but for all the drives that did mount fine, I was able to successfully move across all the data to another drive without issue.","It took 51 years before hard disk drives reached the size of 1 TB (terabyte, i.e. 1,000 GB). This happened in 2007. In 2009, the first hard drive with 2 TB of storage arrived. So while it took 51 years to reach the first terabyte, it took just two years to reach the second. Considering that we now have tiny, cheap USB sticks that can hold up to 64 GB of data, which is about 1,600 times more than a normal hard disk drive in 1990 (40 MB), and 12,800 times more than the first consumer hard disk drive in 1980, things have certainly moved forward! It’s crazy to look back at these older drives, and think that at the time 40MB seemed like it was a lot!","lacie","One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade! It’s different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80’s. They don’t have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits – fresh.","Size: 1055.9MB Result: Success – although it sounded like death!

LTO is still our preferred archiving method – but it’ll be interesting to see in 10 or so years time, if we still have access to the LTO decks to access our content! Even though most of these drives seemed to work – getting data off them is obviously another issue all together.","Some people believe that the actual physical motor in the hard drive will fail long before the data on the disk platters degrades significantly. While this is an issue for a hard disk that has been sitting around for a long time, if the disk is used once in a while (at least every 3-5 years), this should mitigate this problem.","That being said, you hear all the time of people booting up 10+ year old computers with no problems, the disks working perfectly. This issue isn’t as much of a concern compared to the previous one, since you should refresh the data periodically regardless. That being said, it’s important to be aware that mechanical problems are the primary failure of hard drives (and recovering data off of platters is not a trivial task, especially in the future when it may be difficult to find legacy drives). Chances are, if you leave a drive in storage for 20 years – it won’t spin up 90+% of the time."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Impeccable Imaginings of the Incredible Ian Barry","p":["…and of course this would shift and change depending on any issues that would arise on the day and any discussions with actors and the DP however it meant that Ian’s solid prep in pre-production gave him more time up his sleeve when he was on set. It also meant he had a lot more time to spend with his cast which was invaluable as unfortunately on tight television budgets, rehearsals very rarely exist.","( Or… My time on The Doctor Blake Mysteries )","And lastly, love what you do. Ian is in his 60’s now and has notched up his 50th year working in film and television. Even after such a long time he is still as excited and as passionate as anyone else working on that set. He would bound out of his chair, scream I LOVE IT and SENSATIONAL from behind the monitor when a shot was nailed and would always fight to get the very best out of his cast and crew. And it is this last point that got me all emotional on the last day, even though I’d only been on set for 3 and a half short weeks. Because it made me realise how lucky I feel to be able to do what I love and to be a part of an industry which is home to such wonderful, brilliant, talented people.","Another big part of pre is going and doing location recces which is basically where you go and visit locations to see if it’s what you’re after. On the visits are the location manager, production designer, director, 1st AD and on this occasion, lil old me. When on these visits each person discusses why the location may or may not be appropriate. Issues that are taken into account could include look, scheduling, budget, accessibility, actual location (are there any noise issues / parking issues / where will unit base go), etc. Not as easy a task as it sounds on paper! At these recces Ian would also wander around the location and run through how he might shoot each scene if this where to be the final location chosen. Oh and a nice little app hint – the 1st AD Andy put me onto an amazing app to use whilst on recces which is called Photosynth. You can get it on your iPad or iPhone and it can take a full 360 panorama of the room which you can then move around giving you a full 360 view of the location. Very handy indeed.","Anyway let me start at the very beginning.","As we edged closer and closer to our first shoot day and things started to get locked down, the meetings became more frequent, days slightly longer and things a little more frantic. One of our last meetings was a “Scene by Scene” meeting in which every Head of Department, Ian, George and Line Producer Ross Allsop would sit down and go through every scene to answer any final questions people had relating to the block and also to iron out any potential issues. And then came shooting…","Be kind. This was by far the happiest and most productive set I have been on in my 16 years of working in television as an actor. The crew were happy, the cast were happy and not a day went by that I didn’t laugh or have a smile on my face. This was because whatever is at the top trickles down and never have I seen a more supportive team at the top than Producer George Adams, Director Ian and the one and only Craig Mclachlan. These three gentlemen set the bar so high and expect nothing less from those around them. That said though they don’t rule with an iron fist, they have SO much respect for everybody they work with and that is repaid in a mutual respect and work ethic that reflects their own.","drblake","drblake_01","drblake_02","drblake_03","drblake_04","drblake_05","drblake_06","Every meeting was just as important as the last and EVERY head of department would fight for the very best whether it be costume, make up, stunts, VFX, scripts or locations. It was such a wonderful thing to observe as each department would try and compromise so everyone could get what they wanted. And to my amazement Ian took EVERYONES opinion on board whether he agreed with it or not. He would sit there very calmly and just listen to what each person had to say. In fact I’m pretty sure I have not heard him once say no to anyone over the last 7 weeks. For anyone that has ever worked in film or television you will understand that is a pretty difficult thing to do.","I learnt that as a director you need to be more prepared than anyone else. You need to know those scripts, those stories and those characters better than you know yourself because inevitably you are going to get asked questions. A million of them in fact.","I started in pre-production about 7 weeks ago, working with Ian on the final two episodes of the series and our first task was casting with the lovely Lou Mitchell, one of Australia’s finest casting agents. Basically for those that haven’t done a whole lot of casting on this scale, Lou, Ian and myself spent about 4 days auditioning actors for the numerous guest roles on the block. One of the things I have always found interesting about casting is how actors quite often come into the room and give a portrayal of what they think you’re after rather than just playing the truth of the character and situation. In this block (I imagine it’s the same with a lot of shows) the scripts were shifting and changing constantly and so were the characters even though the purpose of why they were in the script never altered. So when it came to auditioning, half the time we didn’t know what we were after and it became more about finding the right person with the right energy for that character and not necessarily what was in the original character description…if that makes sense.","In terms of coverage Ian loved depth and dynamic within a frame. If a scene had been written as four actors sitting around a table having a discussion, he would look for reasons to get them moving around the room making for a far more interesting dynamic. In terms of depth he loved to shoot through “layers” and was constantly asking for more FG (foreground). He would use anything and everything he could to shoot through including doorways, windows, a floating bookcase, trees etc. He also utilised quite a lot of movement with both camera’s either being on a dolly or a slider which helped when capturing the constant movement that Ian loved to have in each scene.","Know your coverage and performance beats but be prepared to throw them out the window on the day. Wonderful, organic things happen in the heat of the moment on set which come from playing on the day, but without having that knowledge and foundation it’s very hard to throw the original plan out the window and see what happens.","Over the course of the last 6-7 weeks I have been lucky enough to be attached to director Ian Barry (who subsequently is celebrating 50 years in the Film & TV industry this year). I honestly couldn’t have been more fortunate as Ian is not only one of the most incredible directors but also human beings that I have ever met. Even after 50 years the man is still as passionate and energetic about making great film & television as I imagine he was when he first started all those years ago.","Shortly after we’d done our days with Lou we began to have meeting after meeting after meeting with each department, trying to nut out every aspect of the two episodes that we would be shooting. These meetings would range from script meetings where Ian and producer George Adams would give their notes on the latest draft to stunt meetings where we would discuss how Ian was going to approach a rather large action piece to be featured in the final episode.","So before I go any further I should probably point out that what I was hoping to get out of this attachment more than anything was to look at how Ian approached covering a scene and also his relationship with his 1st and DP. I also wanted to look at how a director puts their own personal spin/style on a series that has already been set up by a different director on the first block.","So I guess the big question after all of this is what did I learn during my time on Blake?","So with my final day of shooting on The Doctor Blake Mysteries last Friday I thought I would write a short blog about my time on the high rating ABC murder mystery.","So you can imagine how stoked I was when I found out that Ian had a background working as an editor and was so all over it when it came to coverage. He would mark his script as if he was shooting on film so that he knew which shot he was going to use where and for what period of the scene. He would also draw a miniature blueprint of each location with all his performance blocking and camera positions as well as basic storyboards. Subsequently his scripts looked a little something like this…","Throughout the three and a half weeks on pre, between the meetings and the location recces and the casting sessions, Ian and Andy (1st AD) would sit down and work through the script individually. Andy would nut out the schedule and how he was going to make Ian’s vision happen on time and budget and Ian would focus on his creative vision or as he so brilliantly referred to it “The movie in my mind.” Ian would also spend the time going through the script and marking it up with different coloured highlighters. When i asked him about it he told me that it was his short hand for when he was on set. Basically he would go through and highlight important plot points / story information / character dialogue so he knew exactly what was going on and what he had to focus on every step of the way. Clever fella!","When it came to answering my question about how you approach an episode in something where a style has already been set up, I went back and rewatched series one of Blake whilst shooting with Ian. What I discovered was that each director totally had their own style and approach visually but kept it to within the bounds of the overall series style. It might be a very subtle different use of camera techniques or slightly different pacing in the edit but whatever it was, each director definitely left their own mark on the eps they directed.","You need to listen to everybody and their thoughts whether you agree or not because that is where you will sometimes find gold.

But in hindsight, I was quite green. Not in the environmental sense, a little bit in one-man-production sense, but most significantly, I had a lot to learn about distributing a film (and, still do for that matter!). Furthermore, most of the toughest challenges and biggest disappointments probably stemmed from the pitfalls of inexperience, exacerbated by being completely unknown. Believing in an assumption that told me the topic was strong and important enough that my documentary would find legs of it own carrying it out of obscurity was a gross misconception. While it is widely understood, in this growing independent market where everyone has the professional tools, films need to be extremely well made, as well as include truly fascinating material, but also having a bit of luck to pop out of nowhere is an often overlooked obstacle. Sitting outside looking in, thinking my good fortune had come with PLASTICIZED’s meagre budget, I unabashedly reached for commercial success. Without a clear marketing strategy, it was kind of like reaching for the stars at the bottom of the ocean.","Benjamin (Hall) Halkin was the co-editing lifesaver that appeared from the heavens. Looking for a project of passion, he kept the film rolling as an objective outsider, offering much needed perspective (we’d never met before LateNite introduced us). I was too close it and too tired. Ben helped fuel the finishing. All those days of footage, to chase a story out of subtitle details felt crushing before he came along. And, despite both of us usually working on properly paying commercial gigs by day, there was a tremendous new energy. We hit it in the head. We built scenes by days, culled the crap, devised an intro/outro and squeezed all we could out of the sparse catalogue of mini-moments giving the film a thematic backbone of sound-bites and character vignettes. Then, on some random day in the month of May, something coherent was found. The edit to this point had already took nearly six months of stop-starting, scene mixing and matching, and a fair few sleepless nights. Yet despite a working structure, the film didn’t feel done, even after a month of fine-tune fidgeting. I was struggling to let go. Could this be the end? Was it what it could be? With what we had, would it even be received well? I guess my preproduction high hopes were lingering like a naysayer, skewing my view. Truth was, I had a lot more to do to reach the finish; I wasn’t done done.","Earlier this year, I gave my film PLASTICIZED away, free for all on the wild wild web. Free to encourage changes in habit, free to spark environmental movements, free to do anything, which includes being free to be forgotten about in the archives of some imaginary cloud. And, if lucky enough to not be forgotten, it is certainly free to be slammed by a fair few presumptuous and merciless YouTube critics who feel oceanic plastic pollution is a joke. I killed myself to make this slightly zealous independent documentary; a not quite feature length film about crossing the South Atlantic Ocean on a 22 metre sail boat (when I had never sailed a day in my life) with 11 strangers lead by a gung-ho scientist obsessed with our global plastic waste. There was a month spent shamelessly asking for Kickstarter cash, a month at sea filming, minus the exorbitant amount of time lost puking overboard, and another 7 months of moonlight cutting terabytes of footage after long days of… well… cutting terabytes of other peoples work. The project was my first crack at something big, something that I had complete creative freedom, and also something with a certain significance, it had a cause. To give it away sort of felt like accepting the film was not a success, or unaccomplished. Throwing in the towel is not my sort of style. I guess I was just very nervous about the thought of letting go, but I knew I had to. I had done the best I could in spite of what some might considered rational goals. All that mattered after failing to sell it, after all the trial and error, the slow going, the mulling over and over, was giving it the unsure opportunity an over saturated online market provided. Then, hoping all that time spent, all the money given and used, might somehow be validated.","It is strange. Making the film has been an obsession, destroying as well as educational. It became better than imagined and less than expected. It gave me so much and asked for more and more. I love it. I hate it. It carries on. I am the plastics guy. As I sat alone under my own imagined acrobatic elephant’s spinning top of pressure, a revelation came, bring another sucker to share the weight next time – i.e. multiple producers! So, despite not reaching illustrious and illusive acclaim, I am proud to have simply completed the beast of a project. And as a filmmaker, with competition high and the capricious viewers’ time precious, I am also so grateful to have had anyone come to any one of the PLASTICIZED screenings. I know it is not a perfect film, but it reassuring seeing it live this second life of sorts, floating around internet clouds, free for perusal, and it feels very worthwhile to prod enviro-discussions globally and plant seeds in the grassroots galore. What better way, or more fortunate way, to do so than through film?","It took awhile, but now I realise PLASTICIZED was all in a place and time, doing the best you can with what comes your way sort of thing. Of course there are a million things I could have and would like to have done differently in hindsight and, I will do next time! I have learned the agonising way, chasing something ridiculous you believe in, is a great idea. Pouring my heart into the film has opened up unexpected opportunities, introduced me to amazing people, and took me to places I have only seen in ‘the movies’ or read about in monotone, black and white textbooks. And, whether I wanted to or not, with enforced patience, my film found an afterlife. In Australia in particular, there have been over 15 grassroots screenings and counting, little community gatherings, non-profit organisation, as much as 100 or more strong, that have supported big eco movements and influenced change such as a successful plastic bag ban in Fremantle, Western Australia. Not only that, support has come from a range of unexpected places from around the globe, Facebook fans, Tweeters followers, etc., which has led to stranger volunteers translating the film into Portuguese, German, and even Russian for free! Festival Voces has a Spanish subtitled copy traveling to remote towns and villages in South America to screen it to increase awareness in areas the topic might otherwise be missed. It is to screen in this November in Paris, in yet another language. I even was commissioned to direct a short film after speaking at one of my screenings. The online festival Green Unplugged has selected it, sighting its merit of its ability to help the ‘regeneration of the environment.’ And, by the time this retrospect rant is finished, with the help of Top Documentaries embedding my awkwardly timed 48-minute film onto their site, the YouTube views will have passed the lucky number of 13,000, defying the online crowds’ typically short form attention spans with solid 100 to 1 like ratio.","Mike Lutman is a great friend and collaborator, who we’ve worked closely since 2010 when he washed up on our shores from San Francisco. He’s currently working full time as a commercial editor at Melbourne’s award-winning boutique editorial company The Butchery, however as an extremely talented filmmaker in his own right, and a passionate advocate of lessening our footprint on the environment – Mike’s real passion is in creating films that inspire change and highlight environment and social issues that aren’t actively discussed nearly enough. In this blog entry we give Mike the stage to chat about his latest project, PLASTICIZED. Enjoy!","Special Thanks to: Ben Halkin @ Bush Ranger Productions Chris Stone, Holly Downes, Graham McCloud @ The String Contingent Roslyn Di Sisto@ Method Studios Eugene Richards @ The Refinery Chris Hocking @ LateNite Films","The 5 Gyres wanted the trip documented visually as well as statistically. The invite to join sounded to good to be true as hungry filmmaker in love with the idea of adventure. But, I also saw the imminent importance of telling their story. This is what gave me the audacity to plead for those filmic funds securing my place on their commissioned racing-yacht-turned-research-vessel, sailing from Angra Dos Reis, Brazil to Cape Town, South Africa, camera in hand. As romantic as that sounds, I quickly found I was in over my head as sole logistics producer/cinematographer/sound-recordist/director/what have you – it was all or nothing on that leaky boat, delicate gear and myself. The whole thing before the edit, was about as independent as it gets. And, to make it even more interesting, once we did set sail, the ship felt like a toy boat in the bathtub of an angry toddler’s tantrum when a storm pelted us so hard we stopped sailing two days just to ride it out. Stuffed full of fruit that quickly rotted and mixed with the stench of human humidity exponentially increasing the further we went across the South Atlantic. I threw up countless times the first 10 days at sea. My main camera quit working after a blindside mini-tsunami. The sound recorder had picked up a crackle from the salt water soaking through its case. Everything was damp, including my spirit. I weighed the value of jumping over board during a squall that ripped our main sail in two as positive alternative to carrying on. Maybe I should have realised 13 total passengers was a bad sign. It might been a good idea to have ballooned my credit card debt to bring a sound recordist, if only to make it an even 14 for the superstitious. They could have helped when I was dying of seasickness or joined me in my hell. A sound recordist is my favourite idea in retrospect. Nonetheless, I was privileged enough to have squeezed onboard the first expedition of its kind in the South Atlantic, something part of a larger study that growing in a global momentum. There was no turning back, this was no return trip. I had to make do.","The Environmental Film Festival of Melbourne was a world premiere sellout! It was a stand out actually, filling the seats faster than the rest and I only heard a multitude of positive responses. That, and a three-Stars write up in The Age newspaper, “A very good, slightly frightening documentary” lifted my hopes high once again. I entered PLASTICIZED into about 2 dozens festivals worldwide, spending thousands of dollars to do so, hours of forms and post offices, DVD after DVD, sent away only to wait a long wait. It took 3 months before the first festival response came. And, since the film was premiere status everywhere but Australia, I had to sit on the film during this time until those responses finally came. Nearly a year had passed now since the trip and only one crowd had seen it! In the months after the glowing premiere faded in memory, the steady stream of ‘thanks for your entry but…’ festival notifications began to arrive. At first it was understood, you can’t get win ’em all, and some were admittedly aimed really high, but then the realisation I wasn’t getting into any of them dropped heavy and slow. Old doubt creeped back. I questioned my film’s merit relentlessly. Maybe it was lacking impact or it was too languid and boring? Did my stubborn decision to make the film I wanted, and to stick with its 48-minute length, sabotage its chances for being too long for the short categories and too short for the feature slots? What happened to the promising start? I was uncertain of its shortcomings. With nearly all festival responses there is little to no feedback. Somewhere in the middle of my festival effort, I became completely disheartened. Every detail I had focused on, all the story telling methods I had chose, were they off the mark?","Thinking back to a little over 2 years ago, before I had to make such a decision, I remember the overwhelming excitement I felt in the muggy Sao Paolo airport. Equipped with a tiny mouth full of broken Portuguese phrases no one understood, and a set of bags overloaded with gear so heavy the seams ripped and grew with every laboured step, I was making my first ‘official’ film, only without crew! While I may have had crazier ideas before, no one had ever given me the cash to chase them. A bit surprisingly, I raised money begging friends, family, and strangers alike, to scratch up a budget just big enough to embark on this ambitious endeavour that landed me there in Brazil. I expressed all the concern and all the importance such an ecological disaster held in my own mind to whomever would listen, in person and online. I do not think many suspected I would take such interest. So, based on a pitch and a plea, a fair few were keen to see, keen to hear more about this ecological disaster; and I owed them, big time.","This ambition came from a simple enough place, a place where many lofty ideas come from, a pub. After a couple of fiery philosophical pints with a tree loving friend, in a grotty old Irish joint tucked away in the financial district of San Francisco, she told me about a plastic island in the Pacific that was supposedly twice the size of Texas. The thought vigorously captivated my imagination. The idea that something so disgustingly vast could have accumulated without the general populations knowledge actually, astounded me! To make a film about it seemed beyond possibility, so disconnected I was, that initially, it never even entered my mind. Little did I suspect, about a year after that memorable conversation, a time in which I had since moved 12,648.53km across the globe to sunny Melbourne, my friend’s relentless pursuit to get involved in that plastic pollution movement would lead to my own invitation to jump on board the 5 Gyres Institutes’ pioneering research mission to film this oceanic plastic disaster myself.","To be honest, even after a fair bit of research prior to departure, the trip revealed how much I actually understood about oceanic plastic pollution. I had read that plastic fragments were the real concern and still, media hype and carefully chosen pictures led me to entertain the thought we could start an new colony on one of these ‘islands.’ This misconception became one of strongest motivations to make the film I made. Not only was there a lack of awareness to the issue, there was a gross misunderstanding that came from this news sensationalism. While I was at first concerned there wasn’t much of a story without seeing the larger chunks of plastic, after the initial samples drawn from the ocean, then repetition and the relentlessness of what followed, I began to comprehend the ocean had a sort of invisible synthetic virus. Something that nearly everyone had overlooked, something far less shocking without consideration, but far more invasive and insidious than we might fathom. What became important to telling this story was how to present an issue that was akin to a doctor telling you to watch your diet when you feel fine. Then one day, your heart stops and it is too late.","When I returned home to edit – bearded, salted and sun burnt – I was still quite unsure what would be the best way to tell a motivating story, one that encourages rather than condemns. I had accomplished the 31 days across a moody sea but what did I have in the can? There was plenty shots of blue and grey water or the crew sitting on watch. Those first 10 days of which were really thin too, riddled with incomplete moments without context, and lots of wind smothered audio, as seasickness was my un-welcomed priority. There wasn’t exactly an apparent path to assemble a full-length documentary out of that wave of footage! And, since my budget pretty much dried up with costly 30-hour flights and purchasing production gear (only to have the sea ravaged it), I went back to paying work as a full-time editor before I had even finished transcoding the lot. It was double duty for months. With eyes soured and a mind taxed, it was hard to suss out a story, let alone find a groove or gain ground, when the last thing I wanted to do was look at another computer screen for innumerable hours more. From that obscure beginning with unlimited ambition, I’d circled the globe by air, sailed and survived an entire ocean, and now at the finish line, I was nauseous with a feeling of being overwhelmed. Finally, my expectations were being grounded. I needed help.","With this unsure feeling pressing my mind, I drag my feet into the polishing. The grade was a go, the score was in the works, and with the online waiting, I constantly tweaked this and that, but moreover, it was my voiceover that haunted me. It was the last thorn in my side and unfortunately necessary to bridge the story gaps as a sort of filmic glue – I hated it. This was just another hang up. I despised hearing my unsuited voice, not for its sound like most of us feel, but for its lack of filmic tone or style, and my journal I kept at sea that it was based on was at times, delusional scribbles. There had been far too many years of listening to the God-like tones of Attenborough, Morgan Freeman, and so on, to believe I had narration career ahead of me! Being so hypercritical, a blessing as much as a curse, and using whatever imperfection as an excuse to stave off uncertainty, I would have gone on forever. I just wanted to make a film worthy of the cause, and in a way, it was my first impression as a filmmaker too. I was making myself go insane with self-imposed pressure and expectations. So, allowing myself to be distracted a bit and take a step back, I went away with Jacqui Hocking to help shoot Spinning Dreams Cambodia. During those few weeks away, like a Godsend, an email came that gave me the hard deadline I couldn’t give myself, “We heard about your plastic pollution documentary and think it might be a good fit for our festival. Please send us your film by July 1st for consideration”."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"half-life-counting-to-3","l":"Half-Life: Counting to 3","p":["Written by Michael Shanks on 9th June 2013","Michael’s hope for E3 this, and every year.","Directed, Edited and Visual Effects by: Michael Shanks DOP: Chris Hocking Production Assistant: Nick Issell Featuring: Laura Lethlean","Special Thanks to: Louie McNamara, Ryan Keenan"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Keeping up with the Comstocks","p":["Meanwhile, in a Parallel Universe…","WARNING: This video may contain game spoilers."]},{"l":"Credits","p":["Directed and Edited by Michael Shanks","Written by Michael Shanks with Nick Issell","Starring: Michael Shanks, Nick Issell, Mahalia Brown With Craig Jansson, Ollie and Scout.

This is one of the greatest things about the filmmaking world – generally speaking, the most talented people at the top of their chosen craft, are more than happy to chat about the lessons they’ve learnt along their long careers, share tips and trips, and just get people excited. We’re massive supporters and fan’s of people such Stan Winston(who has sadly passed away, however his legacy lives on!), Stu Maschwitz, Andrew Kramer, Mike Seymour, Kanen Flowers, Philip Bloom… the list is almost endless. All of these people are hugely well respected and highly regarded, are expects at what they do, have an amazing list of credits, but still go above and beyond to share their knowledge about the industry they all love.

He’s stupidly talented, doing absolutely amazing work, but is also more than happy to share his knowledge with like-minded people.","Any other final thoughts?","FugDuck","Here’s an interview we did with Lucas, talking about this amazingly exciting new project (that we really hope you’ll help support!)…","How long will it take to finish the film?","It’s quite a departure from your first film “Pigeon: Impossible”.","Just a huge thank you to the people who have supported this project so far, and to you for helping spread the word. It’s a very special project, both in terms of the story, but also how we’re making it. We were a little nervous to see how people would react, but it’s been fantastic to see so many people get what we’re doing and rally behind us. I can’t wait for everyone to see the finished film!","KatrinaCU_OriginalColor","Lucas documented his whole process in an amazingly insightful and hugely helpful podcast, as well as running a couple of extremely successful XSI courses over at fxphd.","Lucas Martell’s first foray into animation was his short film Pigeon: Impossible. The 6-minute short took nearly 5 years to complete and was a crash course on every aspect of CG production. In addition to writing and directing, Lucas did all of the lighting, rigging, pipeline development, and most of the character animation. The final film has been shown in over 200 festivals in 43 countries, and won more than 20 awards including Best Short at the Oscar-qualifying Montreal World Film Festival, and Best in Show at ArtFutura in Spain. The film was also a viral hit, having passed 8 million views on YouTube alone.","OceanMaker was definitely a lot more “professional”. As I’ve become better at writing stories, I was able to put together a pretty solid script in just a few days, and about 80% of that survived to make it to the screen. On Pigeon: Impossible I was just learning storytelling and animation, so it was much more like filmmaking by trial and error. OceanMaker also had a much larger crew… at least in the sense that most of the hands-on work was done by other people. I also had some help on Pigeon: Impossible, but it came in short chunks here and there. For the main stretch of production on the OceanMaker, we had a crew of 8 working full time for 6 and a half weeks.","OceanMakerAnnouncement","Since Pigeon: Impossible, Lucas has created several original feature projects, all in various states of development, as well as working on a new short film entitled The OceanMaker.","Tell us about The OceanMaker.","That six and a half weeks was also pretty unique. Can you talk about that production process?","That’s a tough question. If we were to keep working like we are now, it would probably take from 6 months to a year to completely finish it. However, if we were able to get the crew back together, we could probably finish all the animation and rendering in about a month, and then there would just be a little left to do with music and post. That’s one of the reasons we’ve started an IndieGoGo campaign. We’re most certainly going to finish the film, but in addition to doing things more efficiently, there’s a few “extras” we’d like to add to the film such as a second character and recording the score with a live orchestra. At this point there’s just a few days left in the IndieGoGo campaign, but even what we’ve raised so far is going to help immensely in getting the film finished.","The idea came from my love of old airplanes. For years I had imagined this fun world where people flew around in these junkyard planes that they had cobbled together from spare parts. It was very “Mad Max in the sky” but it didn’t have much of a story. When I finally was able to spend more time with it, I deconstructed the idea and realized that the world needed to be post apocalyptic in order to justify this old, decaying imagery I had envisioned. The last step was figuring out why planes would be so important in a world like this, and the idea came up that maybe they would be fighting over the clouds. From there it was clear that water needed to be a scarce resource, so that was pretty much the setup for the story.","The OceanMaker is a 9-minute animated short set after all the earth’s oceans have mysteriously disappeared. The story is about a pilot who has learned how to seed the clouds, but in order to do so, she must fend off vicious sky pirates who roam the skies, stealing every last drop of water out of the clouds using these huge nets. It’s a very fun, inventive action-packed story, but there’s also a lot of emotion and the ending in particular is going to be very powerful… not something you find in your typical airplane movie.","Was the production process pretty much the same for OceanMaker as it was for Pigeon: Impossible?","Well since we’ve returned we’ve had to go back to the more traditional indie way of working. People put in an hour here and there when they have the time, but its not consistent. At this point we’re probably about 65% finished, which means that the story is pretty much locked but we’re still tweaking a few moments. Animation is about 80% finished, and most of the assets are done. We still have quite a bit of lighting and rendering left to do, but that’s a more technical process and we can’t do much more until all the assets are 100% finished.","Where did the idea come from?","Yeah Pigeon: Impossible was a lot of fun, but I knew that when I did my next short I wanted to do something totally different. It didn’t make sense to do something that had the same tone and feel. I’ve got a few feature projects that are right in line with the style of Pigeon: Impossible, so I thought I’d try something that would stretch my range creatively and do something that was more of an action-drama than a comedy. The big thing I’ve learned is that drama requires a lot more screen time. With comedy, its usually best to be quick and punchy. With drama, you really need more time to spend with the characters in order for the audience to bond with them. This was especially challenging because OceanMaker doesn’t have any dialogue, and our hero character is sitting in a plane the entire time, so creating those touchstone emotional moments has been the biggest hurdle, but I think we’ve found some really good solutions.","Yeah, the big thing I took away from Pigeon: Impossible and several other projects I had done, was that having people working remotely in their spare time isn’t a very productive way to go. I always said that if I were going to do another film, we needed to find a way to assemble a crew and get them all in the same location. I had saved up a good chunk of money, but not enough to hire all the artists I needed. So instead, I “bribed” them by moving production to a small island in the Caribbean. It was a bit like animation camp. We flew everyone down, and we all worked our butts off for the month and a half. The great thing was it was incredibly focused. People were there to work, and of course we still enjoyed the location, but having everyone in one place and totally dedicated to the project made us incredibly productive, and we were able to finish more than half of the film in the time we were there. That’s pretty remarkable for an animated film of this caliber, and it not only made it a great life experience for the whole crew, but it also let us do the film for a fraction of what it would have cost to do thing a more traditional way.","You mentioned that you’ve finished more than half of the film.

In talking about Dead Poets Society he said:","Alec Baldwin & Liam Neeson were originally courted to play the Robin Williams role, at the time they were complete unknowns","Another studio offered to make it as a TV movie, Tom’s response – “Go Fuck Yourself!”","Day 3 kicked off with another “In Conversation With” session with one of the international guests, a man that I’d already heard talk a number of times over the conference, Tom Schulman. What I loved about listening to Tom Schulman and Paul Abbott(the two international guests) were that they weren’t afraid to be completely open and honest with their failures as well as their success. Tom spoke at great length about the difficulty of being a writer in Hollywood and his love affair with movies.","dps","Early on in his life, Tom had been a philosophy major which he said he found to be rather uninspiring. What set him on his path to Hollywood was a task that was set for one of his philosophy classes in which he had the choice to either write a term paper or make a short film about the subject matter. As most students would’ve done, he decided to shoot a film.","He also chatted about his successful comedy feature Honey, I Shrunk the Kids which was a rewrite on an original drama concept that Disney had called Rounded. When Schulman was first contacted they told him that he had seven days to turn the film into a comedy as they started shooting in ten days. The entire project hinged on Schulman’s rewrite as Rick Moranis was threatening to walk off the film.","He finished with this quote which I found rather cool:","He wrote a one hundred and seventy five page outline before even beginning the script","histc","It took him two to three years to figure out if he wanted to write it or not","malcolm","The film went through two directors before finally getting underway with Australian Peter Weir at the helm","This little experience got him hooked on telling stories through the medium of film and soon after completing the short he began to borrow the college’s old Arriflex camera so he could shoot his own little shorts.

At this point he never saw himself as a writer and ended up going to USC film school where he wanted to direct rather than write.

Of Malcolm, David Parker told the audience that distributers didn’t want to touch it in Australia but as soon as he took it abroad and sold it in the States they were automatically interested. He also mentioned that rather than shoot the script that had been rewritten for funding approval, they took the money and shot their original script – ballsy, and something I doubt you’d get away with these days!","Stephan Elliot spoke extensively about the timing of movies. He said that Priscilla came at a time when HIV/AIDS was a topic that had been flogged to death and that people were getting tired of the dreariness of how it was being dealt with in the media. Priscilla showed an uplifting spin on the topic which is why Stephan feels it found an audience. This was a point that Tony Briggs also touched on when talking about The Sapphires and how the Stolen Generation had been previously represented before they made the film.","Tom Schulman pretty much touched on everything he’d spoken about in the other 500 sessions that I’d seen him in so not much to report on there.","What ended this session though, was a discussion that arose from an audience member asking why Australian comedy or even film in general didn’t “travel” well overseas. What made this discussion interesting was an American woman (who had been a staff writer in at Disney for twenty years before marrying an Australian and moving here ten years ago) had to say. She said that American’s make movies for an audience whereas Australian’s make movies to please the funding bodies and the industry as a whole.","This is something that, to be honest, I kind of agree with. I think due to the lack of a studio system here, it means that we are limited in terms of where we can go to get money and the biggest source comes from film funding bodies like Screen Australia and the state funding bodies. Unfortunately for us these funding bodies are government run and therefore have to adhere to certain guidelines when it comes to financing film, which is understandable.","Red Hill","I think this is starting to shift with some bolder, more independent projects, starting to come to the fore in the last few years thanks to private investment and crowd funding ( Red Hill, Undead, The Tunnel, Crawlspace, etc) however it’s an interesting thing to think about. What makes our industry tick? Do we make films for the market place like Seph, Emile, Penny, Tom and others had mentioned continually during the three days of the conference?","Maybe it’s time we had a good hard look at the kind of films we make and possibly make some bold steps to change it for the better. And perhaps this is already happening with films like The Rover, Son of a Gun and Predestination all currently in production. I’m not saying there isn’t room for our art house dramas like Snowtown, Wish You Were Here and Animal Kingdom– they are all amazing films in their own right. However we need to start looking at a balance between our art house cinema and our slightly more popcorn cinema so we can start to be more sustainable as an industry.","thetunnel","That’s it from the AWG conference.

They were:","Has to put an Australian cast up against American casts, how do they compete?","Have something a bit different, perhaps a bit of publicity or festival driven","He also spoke about Original Concepts as opposed to pre built franchise/brand ideas, sighting examples and thoughts behind both models. In regards to original concepts he spoke about the importance of cast as, without a pre built audience, they are what you’re selling on the poster. In the case of a pre built brand he used the example of Mao’s Last Dancer which, before going into production, was based on a book that had sold 1.3 million copies worldwide so you could argue that you potentially already have 1.3 million ticket sales in the bank before you even start rolling.","He also spoke about what he called, the writing paradox for producers, “Everyone wants the new original thing that’s worked before”. A really interesting concept which had me thinking for quite a few days about that in relation to my own projects. It seems to have been a constant theme throughout the three days, how do you take what’s already been done and find that hook, that original twist?","I was looking forward to this session more than most as it was about developing content that works on an international scale rather than just a local scale and it also had one of the best panels of the weekend. It was chaired by Jan Sardi(writer, Shine) and featured Penny Chapman(Producer, Matchbox Pictures), Seph McKenna(Head Australian Production, Village Roadshow) and Emile Sherman(Producer, The King’s Speech, Shame). Looking forward to where Chris and I would like LateNite to head, this was a very important session as we want to think big in terms of the film and television that we want to produce.","In terms of the business side of things, Emile echoed Seph’s comments about knowing your market. He said it distresses him to see writers working on concepts that don’t have an audience and that his job a lot of the time is to work with writers to shape their film into something that has market appeal. He also mentioned thinking about budget early on when writing. For example The King’s Speech was made on a budget of 13 million as they knew with Firth, Rush, Pearce and Bonham Carter starring that would be able to safely recoup their budget from box office numbers. With his other film Shame, they knew it would only have a very small art house release due to the subject matter and therefore only had a budget of 6 million.","madmax","Makes some sales in Australia and some small art house sales world wide","Needs a decent PA/Marketing budget","Often comedy (perhaps based on a book)","Penny Chapman was last in line and she spoke at great length about her experience at working in the Hollywood system after her company Matchbox was bought up by NBC Universal back in 2011.

I was thoroughly disappointed with the talk which didn’t really seem to go anywhere. The panel seemed to talk mainly about the fact that Sci Fi could definitely and should be made in Australia, but really it isn’t that much. It was a real shame because the session was packed with writers who I think were expecting a bit more of an insight into Sci Fi writing and the deconstruction of what makes it work in Hollywood but perhaps currently not here.","The one thing I did pull out of this talk was the idea of Sci Fi content being impossible on low budget and that’s why it’s not really funded in Australia.

I’m excited this year because for once I have seen almost all (I’m short a Lincoln and a Zero Dark Thirty) the films nominated in both performance and technical categories. I’m pretty opinionated about stuff like this so please take whatever I say with a grain of salt, no use tearing me to shreds - just a humble movie goer’s opinion.","Let’s start with the technical shall we:"]},{"l":"VISUAL EFFECTS","p":["The field is an interesting one as majority of the films nominated are films people think under delivered on story and performance but had shit hot visual effects (which is what I like to call the “Michael Bay” effect). After realizing I have absolutely no idea about visual effects I decided to palm it off to Chris, our post guru and tech director to answer this one, here is what he had to say…","Before I get into the actual films – this year is a REALLY important year for the whole Visual Effects industry in regards to the Academy Awards, because for the first time, it looks like visual effects artists are finally going to take a stand and protest at the big event. For those that don’t know, the last few months have been depressing and incredibly scary for the whole visual effects industry – with the bankruptcy and re-emergence of Digital Domain, medium size post production facilities falling left, right and centre – and recently Rhythm & Hues filing for Chapter 11 hit right before the VES Awards. What makes this so frustrating and confusing is that Rhythm & Hues was the company that brought Richard Parker to life (aka the incredible Tiger in Life of Pi), and well as doing a bulk of the visual effects on Snow White & The Huntsman. Together these two films have grossed almost a billion dollars worldwide, so it’s absolutely insane and mind-boggling to think that a company with so much talent, and such a good track record, can be forced to file for bankruptcy. What’s even more depressing is that many of the artists who worked nights and weekends to create these incredible effects are out of work, and still unpaid for weeks of work (including many late nights and weekends) on NEW tent-pole films managed by the same film studios (Fox & Universal). Visual Effects artists are creating INCREDIBLE IMAGES, that are translating into HUGE box office numbers – and yet the companies that create the work are going out of business. Sadly – the Hollywood Visual Effects industry is broken, and drastic measures need to be taken to restore it. Unfortunately I don’t have any magical solutions – but all I can ask is that people try and support the protest in any way they can – even if it’s just posting your support on Twitter. And on that depressing note – let’s discuss the actual films.","The nominations this year include some really solid visual effects films – The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Life of Pi, Marvel’s The Avengers, Prometheus and Snow White and the Huntsman. The only film I haven’t managed to check out yet is Snow White – although it’s definitely on my “to watch” list.","Peter Jackson is one of my heroes – and although I was never a big fan of Lord of the Rings – checking out The Hobbit in VMAX was definitely one of my biggest priorities at the start of the year – not only because I was sure it was going to be an epic and enjoyable film, but also because it was the first film I’ve ever seen filmed and projected at 48fps. If you think about this in a VFX sense for just a second – this means that each of Joe Letteri’s talented VFX artists at Weta Digital had pretty much double the amount of work to do – double the roto, double the renders, double the storage (i.e. about 6 petabyte’s!). This is a huge achievement in itself – but then when you consider this film was also shot in stereo, your head starts hurting. This film really pushed the boundary in every sense – and I won’t go into too much more detail (check out this INCREDIBLE fxguide article if you want to get really geeky) – and although some audiences complained about 48fps and the use of stereo on a whole, I don’t think anyone can argue that the “Gollum” scene was nothing short of spectacular. This was one of the most technically brilliant, but also entertaining and captivating scenes of any films this year. It’s also proof that VFX doesn’t have to be all about big explosions and out-of-this-world set extensions – Gollum looked so real, that you instantly forgot his a digital creation, and just got sucked into the scene. Sadly, for me, there were some other sequences that didn’t really hold up on the big screen, so I don’t think this film will win Best Visual Effects – but huge points to the incredible team in New Zealand for bringing Gollum to life in 48fps Stereo! Epic effort!","I was fortunate enough to see Prometheus on opening night at IMAX – and despite lots of people having complaints about the logic and storyline of the film, I personally loved it. I’m a MASSIVE fan of the whole Alien series – and personally this film really lived up to my expectations. In terms of Visual Effects – the skin work that was done for the Engineer at the opening of the film was absolutely incredible (and basically proof that VFX can now basically create photo-realistic humans) – make sure you check out this fxguide article for all the details. Another really impressive sequence is when David (the android) uncovers a three-dimensional star map inside the Orrery (the Engineers’ spacecraft control room) – and the whole space transforms into a giant virtual map of the universe – a true work of art (both creatively – but also technically, as they used deep compositing to great effect). Overall – I was a massive fan of this movie, but although there were same incredible effects – I still don’t think it’s the best of the bunch.","I really need to see this film again, because every seemed to love it – and I just got bored in the cinema. Admittedly I saw it late at night – so maybe I was just too exhausted for a epic VFX-fueled superhero roller-coaster ride. However, from a VFX point of view – this film was incredibly impressive. ILM always does an unbelievably good job with Iron Man – but this was a step-up yet again. This film has massive explosions, giant set extensions, virtual body doubles, completely digital characters and really cool HUD’s. The effects work was incredible – but again, I don’t think this will take out the Best Visual Effects Oscar.","So given I haven’t seen Snow White yet… that leaves us with my favorite film of the bunch – Life of Pi. This film is a visual masterpiece. With digital oceans and water, completely photo-realistic digital animals, incredible fur and hair simulations (including creatures that are wet) and the fact that this film was shot in stereo – there really is a lot to take in. This film truly is magical – both in terms of it’s story, the look, and of course, the visual effects. It’s also one of the few films that I would highly recommend trying to see in a 3D cinema – the whale scene alone is spectacular. Again, for all the nerdy details, make sure you check out fxguide’s article– it’s especially worth checking out some of the breakdowns just so you can see how much work is in fact all VFX.","And so, I have to agree with the The VFX Predictinator– I think Life of Pi will definitely take out Best Visual Effects this year round – which is both incredibly exciting because I think it’s well deserved, but also really sad when you think that Rhythm & Hues is now bankrupt, and a lot of the incredible artists that worked on this film are now struggling to find work. Hopefully though, if it does win – it will spark further conversation about the state of the VFX industry, and we will be able to find a way to make VFX profitable once again.","Heart Says: Life of Pi, Bill Westenhofer, Guillaume Rocheron, Erik-Jan De Boer and Donald R.

I loved all the films nominated (except obviously Lincoln as I’m still yet to see it). My heart would love to see Silver Linings win as I think it’s one of the best, most intelligent romantic comedies in years but my head says Argo is probably more deserving.

He is arguably one of the most unoriginal, yet so ridiculously original writer/directors in Hollywood history. He would be my pick but I have a sneaking suspicion that with the controversy surrounding his script (particularly the use of the n word) he may get pipped at the post by Zero Dark Thirty writer Mark Boal who seems to have had a bit of buzz going in. But honestly, could you get more original than a German bounty hunter pretending to be a dentist… I think not. Don’t think there will be much competition from Moonrise Kingdom, Flight or Amour.","Heart Says: Quentin Tarantino, Django Unchained Head Says: Mark Boal, Zero Dark Thirty","django-unchained","1134604 - Zero Dark Thirty"]},{"l":"FILM EDITING","p":["Again I’ll handball over to Chris for this one…","OK, so I’m probably not the best person to comment on this, as I’ve only seen two ( Argo& Life of Pi) of the five nominations ( Lincoln, Silver Linings Playbook& Zero Dark Thirty) – but the two films I have seen both had incredibly strong editing.","Argo’s editor, William Goldenberg(who also cut Zero Dark Thirty!) has now earned his third and fourth nominations without a win – but given he lost out to The Matrix and Return of the King in previous years, he’s in pretty amazing company even without a statue! The odds seem to be very much in his favor statistically – but the reason I think he’s in with a really good chance is that Argo is just a really fantastic film – and when you have a really solid film, you tend to forget the craft of editing all together, and just get sucked into the film. Admittedly I never once thought during the film “man, that’s a really good cut” – but I think that’s what makes a well edited film – you don’t want to actually notice the cuts at all, you just want to escape your world and be transported somewhere else. Argo definitely pulls you in.","Everything about Life of Pi is technically brilliant – it looks incredible, it sounds amazing. Even if you hated the film, you can’t deny that it’s a visual masterpiece. Life of Pi’s editor, Tim Squyres did an absolutely incredible job tying such a complex and visually breathtaking film together – but the only thing that could potentially go against him is that the visual effects may outshine the actual cutting. When you have a film that has so many incredible visual effects – it’s really hard to separate what’s offline editing, and what’s done in online. Given this, I think Argo has the edge out of the two films I’ve seen.","Heart Says: Tim Squyres, Life of Pi Head Says: William Goldenberg, Argo","life-of-pi","argo-1","Back to Nick again…"]},{"l":"CINEMATOGRAPHY","p":["Again this is a tough one without having seen Lincoln and also not really being where my talent lies as a filmmaker.

The press have made it a race between Ang Lee and Spielberg, with the latter seeming to be the current favourite. I’m going to go against all odds and cheer for the director who has absolutely no chance of winning but probably deserves to. Benh Zeitlin took a piss poor budget of 1.8 million dollars and managed to make one of the most unique films of the last ten years. It is a film that is beautifully written, designed, shot, scored, edited and with performances (from non actors mind you) that were so powerful you were left wondering why you’d never heard of them before.

Beasts of the Southern Wild should win Best Film in 2013, and here is why. Benh Zeitlin is a young filmmaker (the youngest Best Director nominee ever in fact) that has made one of the most unique films I have seen in years. A film that is beautiful and poetic and is truly a film that has to be seen at the cinema. It made me laugh, made me cry and moved me in such a profound way that I was thinking about it for weeks after I’d seen it. It won’t win because it doesn’t have the marketing power or studio backing like the rest of the films do, and Zeitland and its cast are complete unknowns, but it should. If this film won it will be making a huge statement for independent film and be a huge inspiration for independent filmmakers worldwide. In a period where Hollywood has continued to churn out the same films year after year, Beasts of the Southern Wild is a reminder that there are unique ideas out there waiting to be explored, they just need to be given a chance.","Heart Says: Beasts of the Southern Wild Head Says: Argo","Beasts-of-the-Southern-Wild","bryan-cranston-cia-director-in-argo-with-ben-affleck-images","I’m really thankful for this year as I think based on the nominated films, it has been an incredibly successful year.

She does talk like that.”","Again on the subject of creativity, originality and open mindedness he said “go left or right without making a judgment on which one is right, writers should close their eyes more”","Hit and Miss","He also sighted specific examples from his own work. About Hit & Miss he said that originally the idea was that it was to be a show about a transexual that becomes a mother of five. He didn’t feel like it was a high enough concept, so he decided to make her a hitman cause he knew that was an idea that would (and this is a quote) “blow they’re (audience) tit’s off.” You can now begin to understand where UK and US television has well and truly started to head thanks to networks like HBO and writers like Paul, basically they take a run of the mill idea, and fuck with it – high concept film and television.","Paul was a pleasure to listen to and I really think captured the imagination of the room, speaking openly and confidently about his triumphs, his failures and his way of working with intellect and good humour. The session concluded with Max Gudgeon asking what he felt made a good writer and Paul responded with:","“Fireworks and discipline. Be messy, be violent, be surprising but be a disciplined practitioner”","State of Play","439956-the-sapphires"]},{"i":"sapphires-a-case-study","l":"Sapphires: A Case Study","p":["Next up was a case study on the enormously successful Australian film from 2012, The Sapphires, written by Keith Thompson and Tony Briggs and based on the stage play also written by Briggs.","The session started with Tony and Keith talking about how they fell into writing, which is something I always find fascinating to listen to. Tony chatted about his love of story telling from an early age (making a few embarrassed references to Phil Collins being his inspiration) and in particular his love of cinema. His family would put up a bed sheet when he was young and project as yet unreleased movies that his dad brought home from overseas (his dad was in the airforce). Keith was much the same, with film being part of his life really early on in the UK, which was where he was brought up. He was obsessed with movies, going to the cinema once or twice a week to catch the latest Roger Corman flick. He spoke of the magic of cinema and how it completely grabbed enthralled him as a youngster. Certainly sounds familiar!","The rest of the conversation was all about the development of The Sapphires and how it came to being on stage, and then the big screen. Basically Tony was doing a play called Stolen for Playbox about the stolen generation and felt he wanted to do something that showed the aboriginal people and their stories in a different light. Something that would make him laugh. One thing led to another and before he knew it he was asked to workshop the play with the MTC in Melbourne and got a brilliant response.","Once the play got up, Keith (who had a pre existing relationship with Tony) told producer Kylie Du Fresne from Goalpost Pictures to go and check it out (he had been working with her on Clubland at the time). From that point on, Goalpost jumped on board and allowed Keith and Tony to develop the script over the next 6 years.","The Sapphires 2","What was most interesting about hearing these too writers talk was listening to their different backgrounds and approaches to writing, and how they coped with collaboration. Tony, an actor as well as a writer, would love to jump up and put the text on it’s feet, giving it an excitable, nervous energy. Keith would then grab his paper and pen and start furiously writing as Tony would be up on his feet, making sure they didn’t miss anything.","The other thing that came up was how Keith handled the fact that this was Tony’s story as it was about his family. Keith said he got Tony to just write EVERYTHING down that he could think of in terms of story and then it was his job to whittle it down and help craft the script, sighting specific examples of scenes from the film that were either different or completely not in the stage play.","As the talk neared the end, one thing that did come up was Chris O’Dowd’s involvement in the project. When he was sent the script, he was the last character (and piece of the puzzle as financing was also already in place) to be cast, so the script was more or less locked into a shooting draft. What they got back from O’Dowd was a series of notes pertaining to the Dave character along with the sentence “I’m an amiable man and this is an amiable character, he needs a bit more edge.” So the writers worked furiously to give the Dave character more light and shade based on O’Dowd’s notes and their own thoughts and what came from it was a more in depth character which helped take the movie in a completely different direction. The writers even admitted themselves that before the last rewrite, the Dave character had a “pretty flimsy backstory.”","A very smart actor (and writers) if you ask me.","The Sapphires 1","So that was it for Day 1. Short and sharp with only the two sessions as I had to head back to Melbourne for the evening. Had a great half day though and saw lots of people who I know and love so was excited about the next two days ahead."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"tropfest-the-rock-show-of-film-festivals","l":"Tropfest: The Rock Show of Film Festivals","p":["tropfest","A couple of days after spending a few glorious hours in the sunshine at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl watching short films and drinking glorious cider, I read an article in the paper that referred to Tropfest (the World’s largest short film competition as we are often told) as the ‘rock show’ of short film festivals. To be fair, i’d say that was pretty accurate.","The celebrity guests and judges, the celebrity entrants, the name actors and directors, the red carpet, the huge prizes (a car? really?) and all the free booze the VIP’s can drink (this assumption is based on John Polson’s closing speech) makes the description of a rock show style festival pretty much bang on. Unfortunately though what seems to get forgotten every year is the standard of films and storytelling which we get presented with as our top 16 out of what we’re told is hundreds and hundreds of entrants.","Now to quickly answer your questions, no I am not a bitter entrant that didn’t make it in, no I don’t have a vendetta against the festival OR John Polson and most importantly, no I am not going to be banging on about what I think is wrong with Tropfest as a film festival. I think plenty have articulated their issues already to great effect. I highly recommend you read two of my favourite blog posts about this here:","Cail Young","Kirsty Stark","What I do want to do though is give my thoughts on the films this year.

To be perfectly honest I didn’t love the film but what I did love is that it was a young filmmaker having a crack (note: not trying to be patronising here). The film had some genuinely funny moments and the performance of the young star was solid. Unfortunately compared with some of the other, higher end films, this little one didn’t really match up in terms of production quality, story or performance (the dudes in the car gave me the shits). Not an epic fail by any stretch and like I said, a really solid effort from a young 20 year old aspiring filmmaker.","Watch Here.","LET-IT-RAIN-K-670x376"]},{"l":"Let It Rain","p":["This one created a little bit of tension in my camp as most people that I was with really loved it. Straight up I thought it was pretty shit. To be fair it was a funny little sketch that you’d have a giggle at and give a decent mark for in a second year uni class but again it suffered from similar things that Great Day suffered from. I think it was a good idea (even if it was more sketch comedy than short film) marred by a badly written script (the unnecessary use of the word fuck thirty times by the female actress at the end) and average performances. Again not an epic fail but compared to the good ones it didn’t really rate.","Watch Here.","TIME-Still06-670x376"]},{"l":"Time","p":["This film created a little bit of controversy as a few people claimed they saw the Screen NSW & Screen Aus logo/name flash up in the credits which I could imagine would’ve pissed a few people off. If they did have a touch of funding it certainly showed with a very impressive looking film which featured some pretty expensive elements including a beautiful sweeping helicopter shot and a car crashing into a lake. Certainly not something you could do on a couple of hundred bucks. That said I really enjoyed the film with great performances from the kids and a really smart story. You could see the ending from a mile away but that didn’t really distract too much from the film. Not a bad entry and my favourite so far – things were looking up.","EDITOR’S NOTE: It was actually Scene 16 which was funded by Screen Australia & Metro Screen as part of their First Break/Raw Nerve Initiative. Apologies Lucas Thyer, Julie Forster and Brad Francis.","Watch Here.","emma-booth-scene-16-still-670x377"]},{"l":"Scene 16","p":["This is a bit of a hard one to judge as I think as an actor I could relate to this and found it funny but as a regular joe, I think a lot of this would’ve been lost. The film looked impressive once again and starred the always brilliant Emma Booth and Ewen Leslie who seems to be actor of the moment ever since his turn in Richard III for the MTC a couple of years back (he was last seen on screen in the impressive Dead Europe). The film is about an actress going through a tough time with her boyfriend whilst trying to prepare for a difficult scene she has coming up on the soapie she is shooting. I thought it was a great idea with a really lovely set up but nothing that really blew me out of the water as being mind blowingly original. I do love Ewen Leslie and Emma Booth though so extra points cause they were both great.","Watch Here.","2_Monobrow_Production-Still-2-670x376"]},{"l":"Monobrow","p":["Very weird and felt like something you’d see on Funny or Die that’s been submitted by a user rather than one of the folks that makes the videos for the website (if that makes sense).

Proof is in the pudding as a different guy behind me thought this would win cause “it’s just so amazing that they got Mel and Koshie in their film”. Head shakes and disappointed forehead slaps all round. Anyway this lame attempt at a comedy was clearly just a bullshit PR entry as it featured both the hosts of the Today show AND Sunrise. I’d mention their names but the fact I’ve written anything about this film means i’ve given them way too much of a plug already. So in short – bullshit film and my new bottom of the list.","Watch Here.","ProdStill01-670x287"]},{"l":"Cargo","p":["I really dug this little take on a Zombie film. It had a great, simplistic concept and was executed really well. The cinematography and sound design were impressive and all the actors turned in really solid performances.

I commend the filmmakers for dealing with such a difficult and daring subject matter but feel like the importance of what they were trying to say was undermined by lazy writing and not solid enough performances despite having brilliant actors like Firass Dirani on board. I could pick the story to pieces and give you a hundred reasons why the short doesn’t make sense is just plain silly but I’ll sum it up by saying this. If you witness a shooting, see a guy bleeding out in the gutter, and your wife calls to tell you her water has broken perhaps a) call the police and explain the situation before attending to your wife b) when the police turn up don’t run away, stop and explain the situation and c) when the cops yell stop and you’ve just witnessed a shooting, maybe stop?

Much like Summer de Roche & Andrea Distefano’s documentary The Globe Collectior, which took out St Kilda Film Fest, Better than Sinatra was a beautifully made short film about a lovable, quirky character that refuses to let life get him down. It followed Raymond Borzelli, a 80-year-old man with very little money to his name who loves to dance and who believes he is better than Sinatra. It had a lot to say about life and doing what you love and I think it was a simple yet well told story with a fascinating character to focus on. Not the most original doco in the world but a well told one none the less.","Watch Here.","Remote-Still-2a-670x390"]},{"l":"Remote","p":["There really isn’t much to say about this one.

The gag is a tired one, it was shot terribly and really wasn’t great. Again it wasn’t horrible or offensive but just well below par of what you would expect from supposedly hundred and hundreds of entrys.

A film made by a Victorian (the second year in a row that a Vic film has won) and my favourite of the night. Sure the premise was simple but what I enjoyed about the film was it wasn’t just a gag, a comedy sketch, a pisstake or a parody. It was a film which had a clear arc, a beginning/middle/end and had a message to convey to it’s audience. You could see that time, effort and love went into this film with the production design, score, sound design, performances and cinematography all playing a huge part in the telling of this sweet, simple story. The steadicam shot early on is one of the best shots I’ve seen in a Tropfest film in a long time. I think it absolutely deserved to win, so to the judges I thank you for giving the top prize to a filmmaker clearly with some talent and with some vision and not just to some schmo who made a Tropfest film to win a free car.","One thing I will touch on before I go is the prizes that are offered at Tropfest every year, a festival which boasts about supporting young filmmakers. I’d like for you to take a moment to check out this little competition that those talented New Zealanders hold every year – the New Zealand 48 Hour Film Competition.","A competition which has a prize pool of over 100,000 dollars every year, most of which comes in the form of gear hire, post production services, camera equipment, cash grants from New Zealand Film Commission & WingNut Films which are to go solely to film production. Now maybe I’m just silly, but do you think that perhaps that might be a little more useful in supporting young filmmakers than a brand new Toyota Corolla?","I’ll leave it up to you."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"hansel--gretel-witchhunters","l":"Hansel & Gretel: Witchhunters","p":["HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS","Now let’s not beat around the bush here. When you go and see a movie titled Hansel & Gretel: Witchhunters, you clearly aren’t expecting a film that is going to have a clean sweep come awards season. What you are expecting though is a great, bad movie. A movie with such a ridiculous concept (and title for that matter) that you are expecting to spend an hour and a half laughing at a bunch of characters in a ridiculous circumstance, perhaps some kick ass action sequences and of course the odd one liner of two (see The Expendables 2 for another great example of this!)","When I heard about Hansel & Gretel, I was excited for a couple of reasons. For starters, it is directed by a bat shit crazy Norwegian gentleman by the name of Tommy Wirkola who gave us the 2009 cult hit Dead Snow, a film with an equally ridiculous concept in that it was a zombie film where the zombies were Nazi’s… yep that’s right, Nazi’s. Anyway reason number two was that it featured Gemma Arterton, Jeremy Renner and Famke Janssen, three actors who I very much adore. And last but definitely not least, it was produced by none other than Saturday Night Live Alumni and the team behind such films as Anchorman and Step Brothers, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. I did say bat-shit crazy right?","dead-snow","In short, the film is about our heroes, siblings Hansel & Gretel, who have had a rather traumatic experience as children having been kidnapped by a witch in her candy house only to make a narrow mistake by pushing her into an oven (so keeping very close to the fairytale we all know and love). Flash forward 20 years and the pair are now bonafide witch-hunters, traveling from town to town to rid the world of witches with their sweet fighting skills and ridiculously advanced weaponry. When they finally arrive at a town close by to where they were brought up as kids, they encounter a Grand Witch in the form of Famke Janssen who apparently shouldn’t be messed with. Cue action sequences, convenient plot devices and ridiculous one liners.","hansel-gretel-2","I’m not going to lie to you – the film is anything but a work of art, but one thing it most definitely is is fun and does exactly what I expected it to do. The action sequences are tightly choreographed and exciting, the one liners are corny and there are some rather strange moments which I’m sure were included at the request of McKay and Ferrell (a rather awkward scene where a Troll covers two fingers in what appears to be vaseline to tend to one of Gretel’s wounds but looks like he may be prepping for something a touch more sinister).","I do really like Wirkola as I really think he has a great mind for the absurd and ridiculous and that seems to be where he is most comfortable. Dead Snow had some particular stand out scenes (a death in an outdoor toilet just to name one) much the same way that Hansel and Gretel does. What it says to me is that he is a director that isn’t afraid to be silly and have fun with his audience and I think he is very conscious of the fact that the film is completely ridiculous which is what makes it so fun. It certainly isn’t for the squeamish (lot’s of exploding heads and what not) but all in all if you are a movie goer who likes a film where they can switch their brain off and have some harmless fun then this is the movie for you.","Oh and if you can avoid it, don’t go and see it in 3D – utterly pointless.","Happy moviegoing!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"hitman-playstyles","l":"Hitman: Playstyles","p":["Written by Michael Shanks on 13th January 2013","47 different ways to play.

Well she took off with Ash for GoneAdventurin, producing her biggest project yet, Cycle On Ceylon.","Teaming up again with Michael Lutman, the 45-minute Branded Documentary captured the spirit of adventure in a 728km cycling journey from the southern to northern tips of Sri Lanka, to raise awareness and funds for Practical Action. You can read about the behind the scenes filming experience on our blog."]},{"l":"JUNE","p":["June was the month a lot of geeks had been looking forward to from the very start of 2012 with the much anticipated release of Ridley Scott’s supposed Alien prequel, Prometheus. Starring a very sexy (and strangely masculine) Noomi Rapace, the film was incredibly entertaining (especially on the enormous IMAX screen) and featured some stunning visuals. However it was (much to the outrage of bloggers everywhere) tainted with some pretty hefty plot holes and lack of character development. My favourite of course being Charlize Theron having a brain malfunction when trying to outrun a falling spaceship, classic Charlize!","All this aside, I did decide to leave out the Prometheus trailer and instead show you the very underrated (and once again little known) Take This Waltz starring Seth Rogen, Sarah Silverman and a stunning Michelle Williams. This film will tear your heart out and make you cry like a pre-pubescent boy or girl much the same way Williams previous film Blue Valentine did. Check it out if you didn’t get a chance when it was on the big screen, a more unique and honest drama about love and relationships you would be hard pressed to find.","01","So June brought about more shooting which is always exciting for us as it means getting out of the office and back onto set. First up was a music video for the very talented Melbourne rockers Money For Rope which consisted of covering the guys in baby powder and having them run full pelt at each other on a basketball court. Needless to say some of the guys looked a little nervous in the behind the scenes footage that Jacqui(who was back in Melbourne for once!) shot.","The clean-up may have been a pain in the ass but everyone had a good laugh at the bands expense as we shot them barreling into each other at 300fps.","Michael was also keeping busy with some more of his YouTube series shooting throughout June. It was all hands on deck as his next round of videos gave us Box Art Battle and A Day in the Life of Max Payne.","On top of these three projects we were also up for a pitch for a drive safety campaign and, as always, decided we would give some of our wacky ideas a test run before we presented them. Lesson learnt, never EVER give Chris and Michael Crash Test Dummys to play with. Odds are things will just get weird…","02","While Jacqui was in the edit room for Cycle on Ceylon(#POSTDONTSTOP), the super-talented composer and musical genius Dmitri Golovko was beginning to work on the documentary score. It was awesome to secure such an incredibly talented artist – for those that don’t know Dmitri, composed the score for Red Hill(directed by Patrick Hughes) for which he received a nomination for Best Soundtrack Album at the 2011 Screen Music Awards."]},{"l":"JULY","p":["Of course being blockbuster season in the States, I have indeed left out two of the biggest trailers in this blog, those 2 being Prometheus and Dark Knight Rises. However who could possibly resist a foul mouthed Teddy voiced by Family Guy’s Seth MacFarlane and created (visually) by Melbourne’s own Illoura. Not I friends, Not I.","This month was another for events with a number of the LateNite crew gracing the stage in some way shape or form. Nick finished up his run at Theatreworks with the production Himmelweg, Chris lent his Post Production know how to the ASE and their Digital Workflows talk held at Swinburne University and Michael made his forum debut at the Adobe Creative Suite 6 Roadshow held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.","And as for Jacqui? Well she was back in Singapore,being interviewed on Singapore’s biggest radio station 938 LIVE to talk about her Documentary Adventures with Ash ( listen here).","If the four trailers above didn’t give it away then you all missed out on Nick’s favourite event of the year. The month of August of course plays host to the Melbourne International Film Festival every year and Nick was fortunate enough (with the help of Jacqui and brother Ryan) to win himself a free festival pass. MASSIVE mistake that was. Above are just a few of the amazing films that he managed to catch during MIFF 2012.","It wasn’t all movie watching though with Nick& Michael shooting a campaign for German Car Company Opel. The ads were part of an online competition and were directed by Nick, Michael and friends Damien Bodie, Kess Broekman-Dattner, Eddy Bell and with the help of Lucia Smyrk and Bella Giovinazzo. The campaign was once again produced by good friend and master producer Paul Walton.","Ontop of this Nick was also shooting a rather, errr, sexy campaign for the Cancer Council which, when released, raised a few discussions on a couple of morning programs and The 7pm Project. Nothing like a bit of controversy!","As the months rolled on it is important to acknowledge the continuous project development that was going on behind the scenes. Geoff Wallis and Nick continued to develop their sitcom The Ushers, actress and writer Amanda Logan continued to pen low budget thriller The Grey Between having already been working on it with Nick for over 12 months (and whilst also appearing on stage at La Mama I might add!) and Nick& Lee Beckhurst began work on their McDonald’s inspired short Thank You.","Things certainly were not slowing down as we headed into the end of the year…","Stay tuned for Part Three!","Onwards & Upwards!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Underwater Realm","p":["Onwards & Upwards","Half our world lies hidden in the depths of the ocean.

The projects, the people, the joy, the tears, the wins, the losses and of course the movies that made 2012. Instead of two enormous blogs though, this year we will be breaking it up into thirds for your reading pleasure and releasing one a week right up until 2013 ticks over, at which point we’ll be revealing some of our exciting new projects in the works.","So here goes nothing…"]},{"l":"JANUARY","p":["It’s funny when you look back on a year and forget some of the films that kicked the year off. In a month where Fincher gave us a splendid Americanized Girl with The Dragon Tattoo, The Muppets made a comeback and the legend that is Scorsese dazzled us with his homage to cinema in 3D family flick Hugo, it was The Descendants, directed by one of my favourite directors in Alexander Payne that I fell in love with. It was as funny as it was sad and ultimately a heartwarming tale of heartbreak (work that one out).","And so 2012 began. With Nick, ready and raring to go, Michael Shanks becoming a newfound member of the team and Jacqui and Chris being the ever-excitable duo, projects came thick and fast in January.","Michael and Nick set about working on a music video for Melbourne based folk band Huckleberry & Me, which was to be shot in the country and involve three very cute kids and some signature Shanks effects.","Location scouts took them out to Woodend, Tarrdale, Kyneton and beyond to try and find the right place for the video.","02","Whilst working on the music video, Nick was also collaborating with our good friends at Inspiration Studios on a brand new web series called Train-In Motion. The series (still in post-production) is an off the wall look at workplace training with the first two episodes being written by comedian Dylan Cole and Nick. The first two shoot days took place at Staging Connections thanks to Nick’s brilliant sister Marnie, and laughs a plenty were had. The first series of 4 episodes will be released early 2013.","We also went ahead with the beginnings of our “no budget” shoot idea where we decided we wanted to try and shoot a no budget short every month for the whole year. Our first was Alistair Marks’ film 0-0 about a stoner who is summoned to build an ark to save the world. The film was shot over 2 days by the brilliant Caitlin Dooley and is currently just finishing up in post-production. More news on this one soon.","January also brought us this:","From the twisted mind of Michael Shanks came his very first music video for his debut single On The Border Line which was recorded under the pseudonym Roadgeek. This was a clip that Michael showed us the beginnings of when we finished up the previous year’s 48-hour film festival, so it’s fair to say it took a little while to come to fruition (understandably so).","The one man (wo-man) machine that is Jacqui Hocking was meanwhile was filming in South Africa as part of her ongoing TOPtoTOP documentary. Chris and Nick have worked out if you ever want to hate on your current situation, just check out Jacqui’s photos - odds are she’s having a far better time than you are!","03"]},{"l":"FEBRUARY","p":["Once again, being Oscar season, there were movies a plenty to choose from with the extraordinary silent film The Artist, the disturbing cult film Martha Marcy May Marlene(starring a new and far less annoying Olsen sister), the equally disturbing but brilliant Shame(starring Michael Fassbender’s penis), Coriolanus, Carnage, Chronicle…the list could go on and on.","The film I have chosen for Feb though is the beautiful Like Crazy. A film that won a major drama prize at Sundance and was as sweet and touching as it was heart breaking. It’s also a bloody good trailer and features the vocal talent of the incredible Ingrid Michaelson.","February had some more exciting projects in store for us as the LateNite train continued to rollick on through the start of 2012.","After all that location scouting in January and trying to work around Michael’s trip home to New Zealand, the clip for Huckleberry & Me FINALLY got under way, shooting in a weekend in early Feb. The results of which are below:","Shortly after we wrapped on the music video, Nick decided to take some time out to perform on stage in MKA Theatre’s Hose which was part of a double bill performing at Theatreworks under the direction of the amazing Alister Smith. Chris decided to take the opportunity of Nick’s absence to continue helping out on the film festival Three One Six Oh!, a festival run by our good friends at Pocket Bonfire and one which we proudly sponsor. The outdoor festival completely sold out and was a huge success with people staying well into the night to enjoy the festivities.","04","In doco land, Jacqui was getting ready for her next big adventure – filming a documentary while sailing across the Atlantic Ocean! Luckily she had some camera assistants with her…","05","February was an exciting month for not only us but also some friends of LateNite as well who were competing in a number of big competitions.","Producer Julian Costanzo took out the main prize at Tropfest for his film Lemonade Stand, directed by Alethea Jones and written by Tim Potter. For those abroad, Tropfest is Australia’s richest short film festival and gets over 1,000 entries every year so this was a massive effort. You can watch the winning film below:","We also had our friend Hannah Moon and her team in the finals of the Optus180 Competition with their TV series concept Starfish. The concept trailer starred 16th Street actors Shannon Glowacki and Emily Wheaton in a cute little concept.","One of Chris’ acquaintances from the SPAA Emerging Producers Scheme from the previous year, Kirsty Stark, had her project Wastelander Panda, also competing in the same competition as Starfish. You can check out the EPIC trailer below:"]},{"l":"MARCH","p":["There must have been something in the air at the start of the year because it seems Nick was obsessed with tear jerking dramas. Either way, if you haven’t seen 50/50 I suggest you go out and see it, one of the most underrated/little known films of 2012.","The start of March was met with the departure of Michael& Chris to New Mexico to see our film The Script Machine, screen in competition at the Taos Shortz Film Festival which was acting as home for the International 48 Hour Film Festival Competition. If you haven’t seen the film, it’s a little nuts but here tis’..","You can also read about the boys exploits here.","Whilst the boys were enjoying the New Mexican sunshine, Nick was busily shooting the next 2 installments of the Train-In Motion Web Series. The third and fourth episodes were written by Ben Ridgwell and the brilliant duo that is Tegan Higginbotham& Adam McKenzie. Once again the series will be coming to you from the web in early 2013.","Nick was also lucky enough to take part in a day long producing workshop with the wonderful Melanie Coombs(Academy Award winning producer of Harvey Krumpet& Mary and Max). A really interesting and insightful day that set Nick up for a great run at SPAA later in the year, but more on that later!","Throughout March, in the true Spirit of Adventure, Jacqui got to discover one of the most unexplored places on earth – Saint Helena!","06","Filming in Saint Helena was a massive highlight. Twas’ a magical place where land-line phone numbers are only 4 digits and there is NO mobile service at all (except for VHF radio). Thankfully, Jacqui managed to complete a short documentary film about the environment & sustainability of the unique island, with an incredible soundtrack originally composed by our talented friends Jordon Scotney and Hayden Schueler.","07","But once again it wasn’t all about us, with some of the brilliantly talented friends of LateNite doing groundbreaking, amazing things.","The boys at Dark Heart Productions raised an astonishing $73,000 dollars to complete the first EVER crowd funding campaign for a television series. Their series The Weatherman, went into production in late 2012, you can watch the pilot below.","Nidhi Chanani, the amazingly talented artist behind the illustrations in Hannah & The Hasbian, was honoured at The White House by Presdident Obama as a “Champion of Change” for her work in the community as an artist.

Onwards & Upwards!","08"]},{"l":"APRIL","p":["The decent run of films that we had at the start of the year dried up in April and there was little to get excited about. Amongst the few decent films were Australian film Wish You Were Here, by the Blue Tongue Films boys and also the big budget Hollywood flick, The Avengers. I chose to show The Avengers trailer for no other reason but to break up the drama trend in the rest of the blog.","The month of April was no different for us as the shooting dried up and we continued on with the development of some longer-term projects including our sitcom The Ushers and feature concept The Grey Between(formerly Splinter).","In April it was time for Jacqui to continue her journey from Saint Helena Island, sailing to South America!","09","After months at sea, Sail-yacht Pachamama finally arrived in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil just in time for the Rio 20+ Summit.

Oh, sorry, no, not a 4WD, just some big battered vehicle on roads which needed a 4WD.","Also supported by MyClimate, (who also work closely with the Swiss TOPtoTOP foundation), I left Nakuru on an epic 16 hour journey into Tanzania.","As soon as I arrive to a filming location the first thing I do is empty EVERYTHING, set up my data-wrangling corner, then re-arrange/pack again in prep for filming. It takes me about 5 minutes – but it’s taken me about 5 years to streamline the process without loosing anything (…except my phone, I’m a serial-phone destroyer… incurable).","At that moment, with this family, I think I fell a little bit for Africa.","But as beautiful and proud as these people were, one thing passing travellers don’t see, is that they need help.","But, although these two projects were more than enough for my solo workload, I wasn’t in Africa JUST to film stoves.","Carbon offsetting, although it might seem small on a local level, is actually one of the most exciting concepts that I have worked on so far. The idea that we can offset our unavoidable impact on the environment through supporting young inspiring people like Francis and Silvia in another part of the world, means everyone now has the opportunity to be an eco-warrior without complete disruption of lifestyle.","Essentially, my work as a documentary filmmaker specialises in branded content for non-profit, social and environmental development organisations.","Film mission accomplished.","For me, this happened in the local school.","Her friends carried her away under the shade of a tree, and I was told not to interfere.","However, as usual (in my bizarre and committed work schedule) – plans changed.","I asked one of the male Tembea staff why men were not involved in the community savings and loaning groups, but was told the process is simply more efficient if their energy is invested into training the women of the community, “after all, they are the ones that really run the place…”. Nice.","I especially loved the confident and empowered attitude one young mother, who told me to stop filming the exchange of money when they were operating the loans, because she wanted me to film the section of savings. I realised a few moments later, that this was to show off how much she had saved the last few months, as she flashed her Kenyan Shillings in front of the camera…”This is ALL mine…” she said with a cheeky smile, then burst into laughter with the rest of the girls.","I filmed the project, and as we were leaving, I saw her sitting by that same tree, and saw that she had regained consciousness. I was both relieved and heartbroken.","I got off the bus, and (I presume thanks to Merculine who had braided my hair) everyone started speaking to me in Swahili which was pretty funny. I must have looked like some crazy expat who wasn’t rich enough to hire someone to carry my bags. But it was nice and the locals were really cool. That’s when I met my next host, Kalanga.","I have filmed with a number of NGO organisations, but I am in no-way desensitised to the effects of poverty. And when one of the young local girls, perhaps 13 years old, collapsed to the hard ground, right in front of me, I realised just how serious the situation was. Food and water. That’s all they’re trying to secure.","I think the hardest thing about filmmaking is that you are not a tourist, nor a traveller, but a labourer with a purpose and a task to fulfil. If I wasn’t this, I could have easily stayed in that headspace soaking up an entirely new culture, language and way of life for my own fulfilment.","I think what I am taking away from these projects, and my time working with MyClimate, is that seemingly complex problems can be solved by simple technologies.","I want to leave you, in LateNite style, with an incredible trailer for one of my favourite films, which ironically is not a documentary – but is so utterly inspiring and believable I really wish it was. Hopefully I can make a documentary like this one day.","I was contacted by MyClimate and Dario Schwoerer, from the TOPtoTOP expedition, who told me that TOPtoTOP (an ongoing project I have been filming for 5 years) had supported a project in Tanzania, which was only one day of travel away from where I was in Kenya. Dario wanted me to head to Tanzania, live with the Maasai, and film an appeal video in support of a Solar Energy Project.","I was sent to Africa to film two of their local project partners, who are reducing C02 emissions by reducing firewood consumption when cooking. Both projects accomplish this by implementing energy efficient cook stoves/clay stove liners – which reduce the amount of fuel needed.","In a typical situation, this would have been the end of my journey. I had been filming for more than 2 weeks, flights were booked, and I was meant to be wrapping up.","In the dry season, when water is most needed, the sun is shining brightest. The simple solution here, is Solar.","It is.","It took about some hours to get to the border of Tanzania, but was a fairly smooth process to get across, (just needed US$50 for the VISA, although they accepted by 5000ksh) – and then another 6 hours travelling to the city of Arusha.","It was an incredible experience to come and film these powerful women. Once empowered, the potential for social development seemed endless – there were discussions about business development, growth strategy, support networks and investments, all concepts I wasn’t expecting to hear from a room full of mothers in a remote village. I was honoured to be invited to their meetings to film, and excited about the opportunity to share the pride of what they have achieved.","It was quite an adventure in the true essence of the word, and after another 6 hours of sand, dust, rocks and holding on for dear life – I arrived at the Maasai village of Loibersoit in the dead of the night. But that moment, I have to say, as I stepped out of the car to be greeted by an entire family of such beautiful and exotic people, not a sound to be heard except for the gentle charms of their glistening jewellery and soft laughter, and looking up to see the most stunning night sky, and then to be welcomed and invited into their traditional home which overflowed with warmth, drinking fragrant tea by candlelight, listening to the first wife and mother affectionately speak to me knowing I would not understand a single word, smiling… after such a long journey, will stay with me for life.","It wasn’t just a solar project that TOPtoTOP was involved in however, they also had already installed a number of massive water tanks in the local school, to help save and collect water during the raining season. The teachers and children I interviewed were so happy with the outcomes of these new tanks, however, being at the peak of the hot season, they had already dried up.","Like every good initiative, MyClimate pairs their productivity in climate action with climate education, and so they made time for me to visit their local school program in Nakuru, run by a local girl called Merculine.","Living in a yacht and putting a priority on buying gear instead of “stuff” has really helped me to lighten my load. I have 2 bags – a backpack with my film / editing gear, and a duffle bag with a first aid kit, chargers and cables, a sleeping hammock-tent (thanks Jungle Run!), then a pair of jeans, shorts and a couple of t-shirts. I also have a “camera bag” which lives inside the duffle in transit – but holds my DLSR, batteries, Audio Kit, sunscreen and deet when on the road. It’s pretty efficient, light and with only two bags to keep track of, it’s hard to loose one. I always keep my passport and “real” wallet with my hard-drive and cards (I keep a “fake” wallet in my pocket with a small amount of cash I might need on the road).","Living in such remote areas of Africa is always difficult to sustain a large family. But the biggest problem they have is water. The situation in Loiborsoit was sobering, not that you could tell from the beautiful smiles on their faces.","Luckily we had bicycles, so travelling to the water pumps wasn’t too difficult, but most women walk for hours.","More specifically, I believe everyone has the ability to invest their time and energy into simplifying their lives enough to be sustainable, while helping to improve the technology of their neighbours, finding a balance in our delicate eco-system, here on home.","More trees.","Mud + Clay + Good Design = No Smoke, more jobs, more opportunities…","MyClimate is a facilitator of carbon offsetting. This means, that they partner and fund local organisations in developing nations that are reducing C02. They facilitate the accreditation of carbon credits, buy them from the local partners, then sell them to people around the world who wish to offset their emissions (such as when flying, causing considerable amounts of C02). So the buying and selling of carbon credits is used to support their local project partners all over the world. The mentality that MyClimate is trying to market to the world, is to “do your best… and offset the rest!”.","Normally the families use a 3 stone system, which is basically just an open fire. Severe health issues due to smoke inhalation are common. The amount of firewood needed to sustain the fire is massive, with families and children needing to collect enough firewood for every day. This does not only have an impact of the social condition of the families, (children spending less time at school for example) but it also has a devastating effect on the environment, through the burning and release of C02, and the deforestation of local areas.","Not only did this organisation develop an efficient process for implementing the energy efficient stoves, but they had also worked closely with MyClimate to initiate a number of “womans groups” working with a micro-finance model so all families could afford the stoves.","Once the stove is lit correctly, there really was complete elimination of smoke. It was incredible.","Onwards & Upwards!","So – after packing my 2 bags securely with help from my camera assistant…","So right now, with these thoughts in mind here in Singapore (the complete juxtaposition of the African Continent), I am preparing on my next adventure, back to Timor-Leste. However I carry with me fond memories of my friends in Kenya & Tanzania…","Solar water pumps may be somewhat expensive in the short term, but essential for the future success of these communities. TOPtoTOP want’s to appeal to all their dedicated supporters world-wide, to help fund the project. I was here in Loiborsot to film the current situation.","Speaking of trees, the second project we filmed was located on the outskirts of Kenya’s largest and oldest rainforest; Kakamega. This particular project changed my perception of conservation and honestly gave me hope for the future of old-growth forests.","Suffering is sometimes hard to see, especially when the people are empowered and proud. The Maasai culture is centuries old, and a lot of the other african cultures are actually scared of them. They are warriors. But, if you look closely, it doesn’t take long to see the effect of poverty.","The first project we filmed was with the Tembea Youth Centre for Sustainable Development.","The last day in Kisumu, I got to film the stove in action – and I was blown away.","The local women and children have to line up, sometimes for a few days, just to fetch one canister of water for their family.","The stove is simple mud and brick technology, yet it reduces firewood consumption by 50%, while also reducing or completely eliminating the emission of smoke once the stove is lit. I have such adoration for simple technologies, but this one really had me floored. I found the concept hard to believe at first, using only mud and clay, but that is why I love being a filmmaker – I was able to witness firsthand and document the success of this simple technology.","The Tembea efficient cookStove","The Tembea Team","The tenacity and enthusiasm of the youths working in Kakamega was inspiring. Silvia, the young accountant who manages the finances for the “stoves for life” project, was full of ambition and eagerness to see the development of their initiative. Likewise her co-worker Francis, another young man fresh out of university, simply radiated with pride for his work, which you see in our interview when he mentioned:","The type of projects I choose to be involved in are diverse to an extreme extent, and each experience continues to take me on meaningful adventures around the world. Last month, the location was Kenya and Tanzania (Africa) working for a non-profit foundation from Switzerland, MyClimate.","They have a few water holes in the area, however they are all dependant on an ugly, old, broken & polluting generator to pump the water up for use. These generators break constantly, and there is no-one in the community who knows how to fix them, let alone able to find spare parts. Also, they obviously rely on diesel to run – which, having just completed the 5 hour trip to the nearest town, is a terrible inconvenience. Let alone expensive long term.","This brings me to my first tip for aspiring travelling filmmakers – bring less of everything, except double the amount of spare batteries, cards & drives.","To get a better understanding of the concept, check out their website introductory video here.","UPDATE (23/11/2012):","Visiting and filming schools is always entertaining, but the children in Nakuru were extra special. They especially loved my light brown soft hair and funny video camera. Songs were sung, laughter roared, hearts were filled with inspiring messages of hope for our future, and everyone had their say on climate change. We had fun.","Within 14 days of the short appeal video by LateNite Films being released to YouTube, keen investors contacted the TOPtoTOP expedition and offered to fund the total amount to implement the much needed solar technology.","Working in social development, or in my case filmmaking for social causes, you are always in a constant state of emotional opposites; proud of what you’re achieving, ashamed at what you can’t achieve, and inspired or perplexed by humanities ability to destroy, rebuild and heal.","You can see the video below, which was voluntarily made in just 2 days for the local community."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"When Gordon Met Chell","p":["Anticitizen Fun!

In the year of the invasion, 5 young Australian journalists were also killed, a story told by Australian filmmaker Robert Connolly in his harrowing film Balibo.","All jokes aside, it was seriously difficult.

This, (in a complete and total understatement), is a BIG deal.","Happy filmmaking, and remember, Sempre Posibilidade ;)","Here’s a few I had to keep up my linguistic sleeve;","However, despite our long days, a few crashes and lack of sleep, we still thankfully had some unforgettable moments to enjoy the welcoming friendship of the locals, the stunning landscapes, and warm tropical beaches.","I can’t wait to get back.","I met Joe and his team when I was shooting our Gone Adventurin’ documentary on the Tour de Timor in 2010 Spinning Dreams.A year later in 2011, and again this year in 2012, I came back to Timor-Leste to join the Jungle Run crew.","If you google Timor-Leste, you will read why.","It’s no doubt that filming almost 400 cyclists through an (albeit incredibly inspiring) developing nation is an arduous mission. When you also add a film crew that comes from 6 different countries (America, Indonesia, France, Australia, Canada and Timor-Leste) and collectively work in 3 different languages (Tetum, English and Bahasa Indonesia) it gets pretty interesting.","Jungle Run are used to achieving the impossible, working with shows like Man VS Wild (Bear Grylls), Man VS Monster, Indian Ocean with…*blush*… Simon Reeve… oh and pretty much everyone from BBC, Nat Geo, Discovery, Animal Planet… hell even Disney!!","Kasan Kurdi is an incredibly dedicated Cinematogapher from Indonesia, who has filmed for Green Peace and some pretty awesome projects in the past. His role changed throughout the race – sometimes on a motorbike getting coverage, sometimes with the medical team, sometimes in the Race Directors car at the front.","Krispin and Armando were incredible local guys from Timor-Leste that joined our crew. It seemed fitting for them to be following the Timorese Riders, which were mostly further back.","Most Documentary filmmakers will be extremely familiar with these cameras, well known for their durability, light weight and effective data management.","My crew role was Camera Op. I was filming on the back on a motorbike with Leni (my Driver), a lot of the time facing backwards to capture the start line, then chasing the leading cyclists for the first section of the race, then dropping back to find the story of the inspiring female riders.","Now.","ohh fuckkk… .CAREFUL!!! = HATI HATI HATI HATI!","Patrick Lavaud, a professional Cinematographer from France (living in Jakarta) was on a motorbike without a driver (as he’s a f*cking big frenchman!) – he was capturing the landscape and beauty shots of the cycling. He also set up the cinematography for the main interviews, and it was his role to prepare all the cameras to make sure everything was calibrated correctly, so things like white balance and exposure levels were consistent.","Peter Wall is a freelance journalist and filmmaker from Canada living in Bali, who’s role was to follow the fastest cyclists to the finish line on the back of the motorbike. Luckily for him, his driver was Sean Borrell – the legendary co-ordinator of the Tour de Timor working in the office of the President (and self-proclaimed crocodile task force co-ordinator of Timor-Leste) who happens to be an excellent and insane driver. A lot of the time, due to the barely useable roads, the cyclists are faster than the motorbikes – so you need a driver that really knows what he’s doing!!","Pull over / Stop = Para (Timorese) + Berhenti (Bahasa)","Slow = Nanek (Timorese) + Palan (Bahasa)","Thankfully there was also support from the National Critical Care and Trauma Center of Darwin Australia who are trained for natural disaster emergency relief. These guys sent a team of 20 medical staff, who were kept busy caring for the bruised and exhausted riders (and volunteers)! What is less known, is that they also donated medical supplies to the towns we passed through.","That last one was particularly important, considering the road conditions….","The concept of Indonesia welcoming the Timorese and international cyclists into the western (Indonesian) side of the island in the name of peace and reconciliation is a massive step forward for Asias newest nation, and even more importantly, a powerful message of Peace worldwide.","The first thing to do on arrival was delegating the cameras, with 4 cards and 3 batteries for each operator. We wouldn’t exchange throughout the shoot – everyone had to care for, clean and look after their delegated camera. I was “Camera C” on one of the Sony Ex3s.","The Indonesian post team was lead by the post-god Amin, with the rest of the team working their asses off as editors, assistant editors and data wranglers.","The most dangerous part of the trip was making sure we didn’t run into the cyclists. Luckily for me, I’ve gathered quite a bit of experience shooting from a motorbike, but it’s always a problem speaking in different languages and hearing each other sufficiently on the bike…","The post team was working off 4 networked MacBook Pros with Avid Media Composer. Everyday they would ingest, log and back-up hours and hours and hours of footage; an epic task.","The producer, angel and Mum on the shoot was Shinta, who, let’s be honest, was the one who made sure everyone had their shit together. She was working on logistics and overcoming all the obstacles any of us were facing, along with another Indonesian from Jungle Run, Putu. It’s not an easy job, as the Tour de Timor is a logistical nightmare. Total chaos. Realistically, it shouldn’t really be possible to run an event like this – but everyone makes it happen. It’s inspiring to witness and utterly rewarding to be apart of.","The Tour de Timor 2012 was the fourth documentary project I had filmed in Timor-Leste, and it certainly won’t be the last. In fact, I will be travelling back in just a couple of months this November to try take on something I have never done before, Directing an UNDERWATER documentary – DivinTimor– working with the awesome David Franjic from Colour Chorus.","The Tour de Timor has happened annually since it started in 2009, an initiative started by the former President of Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta, as part of his “Dili City of Peace” campaign.","The Tour de Timor is the most epic mountain bike race in Asia. This year the riders came from 18 different countries cycling through extreme terrain, including 83 inspiring local Timor-Leste riders.","Then we had Wil Hemmerle, who was all things audio. Enough said. Everyone knows how important audio is, so really, Will is what made the production value of the footage so strong. His responsibilities included plugging into our cameras when we were doing interviews at the start or end of the day, and making sure our settings, mics and lapels we had on were set up correctly.","There was even an Indonesian team of medical students which took part in the race, and the camaraderie between the Indonesian, Timor-leste and international cyclists was nothing more than inspiring.","To film something like this was going to be manic – we needed 6 Motorbikes with 6 local Timorese Drivers, 2 FWDs, heaps of Audio gear, adventure supplies and 6 Sony EX3 and 3 Sony EX1 cameras.","To pull this huge race off, there were over 300 support staff, helping out on water stations, working as bike mechanics, cooking, co-ordinating… lots of them volunteering their time. There were over 100 vehicles, with two conveys; at the front and back of the race stages, plus great support from the UN.","We all had to have a day pack, as the shoot days were long and extremely hot. We needed food and water. This was really important, as it’s easy to pass out, and the medic team was busy enough with the cyclists. One of the massive lessons learned from filming the previous year was making sure everyone had a good camera and lens cleaning kit. The dust and dirt from the bikes is bad.","We had a lot of footage, and we had a lot of gear.","We had a team of 2 world-class cinematographers, 6 camera operators, 2 Producers, 1 Production support person, 4 Editors, all being inspired and driven by the one Director and visionary, Joe. Outside of the film crew there was a bunch of media crew from the Tour de Timor which helped with the vision and logistics."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"waiting-on-sound","l":"Waiting On Sound…","p":["A good wireless lavalier kit goes for roughly four times the cost of an iPod touch, and suffers from radio interference and complexity. Build me a lapel mic that wires to an iPhone/iPod in my actor’s pocket and you just saved me endless headaches and hundreds of dollars.","ADR is hard.","After a solid 1,274 blog posts, one of my heros, Stu Maschwitz has finally taken the time to write a detailed article about the pain of getting good audio, titled Production Audio is Ripe for Revolution. Apart from a really tiny blog post that links to an external article this is the first time that Stu has really even mentioned sound in any great detail – which is telling in itself. What’s really interesting though is the amount of feedback his post has gotten…","And let my intern log into the same account and tag the incoming audio files with slate info and other useful metadata, like the name of the character being recorded—all while we work.","Are you a musician or a painter? I think if you have a musical ear, then maybe sound will come naturally to you. However, if you prefer to communicate with the world visually – maybe it’s just really hard to “get” sound. Really though – the basic’s are easy and anyone can learn it. But to get good at it, you need to practise, just like anything in life.","At the end of the day filmmaking is all about collaboration, teamwork and compromise.","Back when I was at film school, there was no shortage of people wanting to be writers, directors and cinematographers, but no one wanted to be an audio recordist. In fact, despite the fact that I was doing my own really, really complex and time consuming graduate film, SAKOOZ– which was probably the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life to date – simply because there was no one else around, I ended up doing the sound recording on pretty much all of my friends films (sadly I’ve never learnt to say “no” – a skill I really need to get better at). After watching a lot of student films, I’ve always known that sound is INCREDIBLY important, and if you have bad sound, it can basically destroy an otherwise good film – so when I first started film school, I spent a lot of time reading blog posts and forums, and invested in some really basic audio gear that I still use to this day.","Best Regards, Chris!","But in the meantime, I think the key to easier audio production is to bring post to set – and make audio cool again.","But the reason I have so much respect and love for a man I’ve never met, is because he’s the champion of “accessible filmmaking” – and wrote one of my favourite and most useful books of all time, The DV Rebel’s Guide: An All-Digital Approach to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap– which is basically the bible for no-budget independent filmmakers. If you haven’t read this book and you’re into independent low-budget epic filmmaking – go buy it now. Included with the book is a DVD which contains a 20min short film Stu did called The Last Birthday Card which he did back in 1999. It’s not a master piece, but it’s very entertaining, and incredibly impressive for a no-budget short, especially for the era. It was also the first film in the world to make use of Stu’s amazing technology, Magic Bullet – which allows you to grade your footage to give it a real cinematic look.","But… while I think Stu’s suggestions are very cool – and I see no reason why technically you couldn’t make it all happen right now using existing tools and technology – at the end of the day, I don’t want my iPhone to be my audio recorder. I want something standalone, dedicated, and rock solid.","Collaboration is the key.","Despite his visual effects background and love of filmmaking technologies, Stu always places an emphasis on performance, emotion, and most importantly story. He was hailed by Shoot Magazine as one of the “Ten Commercial Directors To Watch”, and has gained a solid reputation as a director who can pull off amazing and visually complex imagery, but always with his signature wry sense of humour – which definitely also comes across in his blogs.","Do I think the tech can be improved – hell yes! Do I hate the interface on the H4N – hell yes! But what made camera’s really useful and mainstream was when they became so good that they basically acted like the human eye. What you see is what you get. This is what needs to happen to sound. The human brain is so darn good at separating voices from background noise – and we need to somehow emulate this using technology. If my brain can decipher a overhead plane sound from a person talking – surely we can replicate this in software. Thanks to CGI, we can now basically create anything we want using computers – just look at Avatar. Visual Effects has finally reached a point where even if you have a trained eye, it’s getting harder and harder to work out what’s real and what’s “fake”. Eventually, this will happen to the audio world too. Instead of having to re-record something, we’ll just have a computer analysis the voice, and then re-create the missing word from scratch. This technology is probably still a long way off – but there’s no reason why it can’t happen. If we can create a perfectly life-like person in CGI, we can definitely create a realistic sounding and accurate voices using computers. Hell – maybe even Apple will do this in the next FCPX release – stealing some technology from the next version of Siri.","Do your research.","Everyone from production to post seems to understand that having accurate meta-data that follows the production from start to end is EXTREMELY important – everyone gets this. Things like MovieSlate already go a big way to making sure metadata is easy to enter, and easily gets from on-set to the edit suite. The future is here – and it’s only going to get better and easier. But with all this kind of tech, it only ever gets used if it’s quick, easy and you don’t have to even think about it. As someone who works in post production, I get to see everyone camera and audio notes at the end of the shoot – and sadly, most of the information jotted down is useless and illegible. There’s no point in having meta-data unless it’s useful. That’s the key – you need to capture RELEVANT information that’s actually helpful later down the line.","For now, I’ll just continue use my trusty Rode NT3 (yes, it’s very heavy on a boom – but boy it sounds great for the price!), Sennheiser ME66, a bunch of cheap Sennheiser wireless lapels, and hire in a Sound Devices 788T when I need one. It does the job – and at the end of the day, as long as your story comes across properly, that’s all that matters. Although capturing good sound is REALLY important – if you have a shit story, then good audio’s not going to save that anyway. If I ever come across large amount of money though – I’ll definitely blow it all on some really kick ass audio gear.","For those that don’t know, Stu Maschwitz is a director, visual effects genius, world renowned technologist. After graduating from CalArts School of Animation, Stu spent four years at George Lucas’ Industrial Light & Magic(leading the Rebel Mac Unit) before co-founding the legendary visual effects firm, The Orphanage in 1999 (which after many years of creating INCREDIBLE visual effects, sadly closed down in 2009).","Have you ever navigated the menu of a Zoom H4N? It’s like playing a Chinese knockoff of Tetris on a Gameboy that was run over by a car.","I agree we Stu – someone needs to come out with a Canon 5D or Blackmagic Cinema Camera equivalent for audio. Something that can achieve near-professional results, but doesn’t require you to take out a loan. Admittedly, something like a 744T is a lot cheaper than, say a RED EPIC – but still, it’s hard to justify paying so much money.","I love filmmaking. I love shooting. I love everything about the on-set experience. Except recording audio.","I love my iPhone and iPad – and I love the fact that I can use either as a slate that is timecode synced to the camera, and that all the meta data captured on set follows nicely along to post. The technology is cool and is only getting better. It gets me excited.","I think the technology can definitely be simplified and improved – however as I tried to explain at the start of this post – it’s not just about the tech, it’s about treating sound as equal with vision. You can have the best gear in the world and it will still sound shit in the wrong hands. You can have the best sound recordist in the world, and they can still record horrible results if there’s no where to properly hide a lapel and if you can’t get the boom close enough to the talent.","I think there’s a misconception that you only need one person to record good audio. Sure, a single person can do all the jobs and achieve good results – just like any good cinematographer can also pull focus at the same time and keep everything sharp – but really, that’s not ideal. A cinematographer should only concentrate on the framing and lighting – and leave the focus to a someone else to ensure that it’s absolutely spot on. It’s the same with sound – the sound recordist should be monitoring all the inputs and ensuring that the levels are all correct, whilst a boom swinger (or multiple boom swingers) ensures that the microphone is correctly positioned and there is no handling noise.","I’m very confident that Stu just wrote this for effect, as I’m sure that he does actually know what the “roll off” switch does – but even if he didn’t – that’s just lazy. You can Google this kind of thing in seconds (Olaf also has a good explanation in the comments of the blog). The information is out there. If you’re really dedicated – you can easily learnt it. That’s the problem – I don’t think Stu’s lazy – I think he just knows deep down how hard capture good sound is, so he chooses to just ignore it. Ignorance is bliss!","If you haven’t already, make sure you read An Open Letter from your Sound Department. It’s an amazing article, and EXTREMELY helpful! While you’re at it, make sure you read Ten Commandments of Sound for Picture. If you’re really inspired, buy this amazing book by audio guru and Acadamy Award winner Tomlinson Holman(aka creator of THX) called Sound for Digital Video.","If you look at the credits of any major television show or motion picture – you’ll see that there’s not just one “sound guy” – there’s a whole team. Just like there’s a 2nd and sometimes 3rd Camera Assistant, there’s normally a Sound Assistant who looks after all the wireless lapels.","If you want to learn more about boom swinging, have a read of The Art of Zen-Boom and Boom Operating: The Art and Passion.","It shouldn’t be a one-man band.","It’s all about teamwork.","It’s also always a balance between time versus money. When you’re got no money, you can justify spending a lot of time on something – but rather than just giving in and saying “we have heaps of time to do post – we’ll just ADR everything”, a lot of the time you will achieve BETTER results getting it right on the day – and that’s the most important thing – QUALITY.","It’s also really interesting that people in the camera department seem to shrug off audio, and claim that it’s completely foreign and an area of knowledge they’ll never possess, and sometimes vice versa – but the reality is that the two worlds are very similar. Highlights, Mid-tones and Blacks impact video pretty much the same way as Highs, Mids, and Lows impact audio frequencies. A camera records things you see – an audio recorder records things you hear. If the camera’s out of focus it looks crap – if the microphone isn’t pointing at the source, it will sound crap. If your footage is blown out – you can’t fix it in post because you simply didn’t capture the information. If the audio peaks, exactly the same deal.","It’s funny – in many ways the camera department and the audio department are very similar, and yet few people think of it that way. Really, the audio recordist is doing the same job as the cinematographer, and the focus puller is doing the same job as the boom swinger – and yet, no one ever thinks that a boom swinger is on the same par as a focus puller on the film set hierarchy! If you look on the majority of student film sets, there is always a huge amount of respect for the cinematographer just because he’s behind the camera, and yet no one seems to care about the poor audio recordist (“Waiting on sound…”, “Boom in shot…”). What I also find really funny and sad is that the camera department always seem to be at war with the audio department, and it’s really hard to get both teams to play nicely together.","Lapel’s are hard.","Less is more. I want the option of three XLRs for Booms (with phantom), five wireless lapels, a wireless transmitter so that the director can listen to the audio on set (maybe this is all done via an iPhone?), a wireless transmitter that I can put on the camera which transmits timecode and a guide track, 48kHz 24bit, a touch screen to enter metadata (as friendly as an iPhone), and some bundled software (like FCP auxTC Reader) that allows me to very easily and automatically sync the audio to the vision and embeds all the metadata. Yes, that does sound like a lot to ask for, but if you do it like RED, and sell the “brain” separately to all the wireless receivers and transmitters, you could gradually build up your rig over a number of jobs. Better yet – you could even split it up into different modules, so that you could add more wireless transmitters/receivers as you need.","Like every filmmaker I’ve ever met, I own an iPhone. Build your portable audio recorder around that.","Listen for me saying the word “check” and set the audio levels automatically when you recognize that word. Flash an alert on the screen if you detect a hum. Or an airplane flying overhead.","Location, Location, Location.","Magic Bullet has grown up a lot since 1999, and today Stu is currently serving as a Creative Director for Red Gitant Software’s Magic Bullet product line – and continues to innovate and introduce amazing new products to the market. I use Colorista every time I need to grade something quickly – it’s incredible. The technology that Stu and his team have created helps me every day to achieve better results faster, and his words of wisdom inspire me to keep bashing away at the art I love.","Make an iPad slating app that emits a special coded beep that contains the audio equivalent of a QR code. Every beep is a unique timecode signature. Post-production software could recognize that and sync dailies easily.","My shotgun microphone has a little switch on it. That switch has two positions. One is the right one, one is the wrong one. You know what? It would be easier to just re-write this short to have no dialogue.","Obviously this is not the solution for every film – you can’t just always pack up and go film somewhere quiet – but in a huge amount of cases, you can solve the majority of your problems by just selecting a more appropriate location. When you’re location scouting – don’t just think about pretty pictures, think about how the film is actually going to sound on the big screen. Make sure you visit the location at the same time as you’ll actually be filming too. There’s nothing worst than realising that the garbage man comes by every day at exactly the same time as you want to shoot.","One big mistake I see a lot of indie filmmakers make is that the DOP will be so worried about a boom shadow or the boom itself being in shot, when in reality, in a lot of cases quickly removing the boom shadow in post will take a few minutes work, compared to a few hours of work if you need to ADR a scene. Filmmakers are very quick to say, “we’ll just ADR that” or “we’ll just grab a wild line”, yet few are comfortable enough with technology and the filmmaking process to say, “we’ll just remove that boom shadow in post”. Sometimes it’s a lot quicker to do things in After Effects than it is in ProTools. That’s what separates professionals from amateurs – a basic knowledge of all departments, both production and post, and knowing what’s possible and how long things take.","One of the biggest problems indie-filmmakers fall into is they always seem to pick a location that has a huge amount of sound issues. If you’re filming inside generic house, there’s no reason that you have to film in the middle of the city, with planes flying constantly over head, a freeway right around the corner, and neighbours banging and crashing. Film in the country – where everything is peaceful!","Over the years, I’ve personally unfortunately fallen into the position where I’ve become the default go-to audio guy for all of our films. I’m not an audio guru by any stretch of the imagination, and to be perfectly honest, I don’t even really enjoy swinging a boom or recording audio on set. The trouble is, finding a good audio person is really, really hard – especially when you can’t pay someone.","People get so excited about the latest cameras. We need people to get excited about audio gear again. We need to get it to a point that people like Stu actually care about audio gear, and are excited to talk about it – not just rant about it’s limitations and problems.","Rate the quality of my incoming audio on the screen, live. Warn me when I have a bad echo, or background noise. Suggest fixes. I’ll move the mic around as instructed and watch the quality level change, and then stop moving when it’s great.","Reading through the comments on Stu’s blog post, a few people have said it’s easy to teach someone how to mount a lavalier microphone. Sure – it might be easy if you’re doing a corporate video, and you need to mount the microphone on someone wearing a suit, but if you’re doing a film where you need to actually hide the microphone, it’s really, really tough. Most of this comes down to costume/wardrobe choices. When we did Hannah & The Hasbian, it was INCREDIBLY hard to hide lapels and belt-packs because the girls were moving around a lot in scenes, and wearing outfits that simply did not have good places to hide microphones on and were generally pretty loud (i.e. clothing with lots of layers that rubs against one another). Luckily for me, the three amazing actors we had were true professionals, and really knew the importance of getting good sound, so never once complained when we constantly had to re-position microphones, use surgical tape to hide cables and belt packs, and have to adjust settings of belt packs, which might have been attached to their belt, or taped to their upper thigh. It was awkward at times – but not once did they complain – trust professionals, because they knew getting good sound would affect the entire production value of the film.","Sadly, every time I’ve ever done sound recording, I’ve always had to boom swing as well. Why? Because it’s really, really hard to find someone who can do a good job. It requires a huge amount of concentration, it’s physically exhausting, it’s mentally exhausting (because you have to concentrate on every line of dialogue – and stay alert in case the actors improvise), and is truly and art. Basically, to be a good boom swinger – you need to be a ninja. You’re constantly having to hide away in awkward positions, you need to know and predict what people are going to say and when, and you need to follow the action – which can be really tricky if people are moving around a lot. It’s also really hard to not make any handling noise – especially when your arms start to get tired. It also takes practise. I always find if I’m boom swinging and I haven’t done it in a while, the first couple of takes of the day are rubbish, but once I get into the flow of it, I remember how to position and balance my body and hold the boom pole in such a gentle way as to not make any noise at all whilst moving the boom pole around. It’s an art – so don’t expect the lighting best boy to be able to just grab the boom pole and do a perfect job.","Self-calibrating surround sound systems have existed in home theatre systems and fancy cars for a few years now – surely some of this technology could be utilised in film production? Wouldn’t it be great if the sound recordist could just press a button, triggering a set of “sweep tones” that come out of the recorder’s speaker, then a microphone on the recorder picks up the “whooping sounds”, and specialised software analysis’s it, and determines what noise reduction algorithms to use. That way when the producers asks you – will we need to ADR this scene, you can answer with confidence, yes or no. Some might say that will just waste time on set – however, I’ve had to wait around plenty of times while the camera team shoots Macbeth charts, or does a white balance – so I’m sure they can wait around an extra 30 seconds while the audio recorder does it’s magic! Hell, you could even do a quite calibration whilst the focus puller is getting marks.","Sound is easy.","Sound is hard.","Stu’s right – we need to take some of the amazing technology that already exists in post production, and move it on set. Imagine if you could do real-time noise reduction on set, so that you can actually hear what the end result would sound like (even if it’s not baked in). Most of this technology already exists – so it’s just a matter of moving it off our Mac’s and PC’s and putting it in a form factor that we can carry on our shoulder. Imagine if Adobe teamed up with Blackmagic and brought some of their post production technology to an on-set product – it could literally be a game changer.","Sure, you might be thinking – screw changing locations, let’s just ADR the whole film. Yes – you could do this, but it’s a huge amount of work. If you watch the credits of any big Hollywood film, you’ll see just how many people it takes too pull off really good ADR – it’s not just a person holding a microphone, and telling an actor to repeat a line – there is a real art to ADR. I’ve watched a lot of short films that have relied on ADR to get the film over the line – and in most cases, you can tell instantly that it’s ADR and it takes you out of the film. Yes, if you work really hard, you can get ADR sounding pretty good – but really, in most cases, what could take you a few minutes to fix on location, could take you hours and hours to fix in post. I always prefer to just get it right on set if you can. The real trouble is that it’s hard to mix location sound with ADR unless you have the right tools and knowledge. In some cases if your location audio really is beyond useable, you might be better off re-doing the whole film using ADR, because at least then things will be consistent.","Sure… if you’re shooting a documentary, or something really run-and-gun, you might find yourself in a situation where the camera operator or director might also have to record audio – this happens all the time. But it all depends on the project. High quality production values do not come from sole operators. I know plenty of fantastic cinematographers who are also comfortable connecting a couple of wireless lapels to a H4N and recording audio – they could do it with their eyes closed. But they don’t like doing it, their not experts, and they are basically just following a really simple procedure. As soon as you throw a curve ball into the situation, then they get lost.","The basic’s of getting good audio are really simple – you just need to minimise as much as the background noise as possible (i.e. turning off fridges, closing windows, putting a mattress in front of a door to limitate traffic noise, etc.) and get the microphone as close to the actors mouth as possible (anything further away than 2 feet will cause you problems). Assuming you have a half decent microphone, have the levels on your recorder all set correctly, and it sounds good in your headphones, then you’ll get good sound. It’s that easy.","The exciting thing is that there’s money in this. If Blackmagic or Sound Devices came out with a audio recorder for the “DSLR crowd”, then people would buy it – so there’s incentive to innovate.","The only company that seems to be making audio gear that’s remotely user friendly is Sound Devices. Whenever I have to hire audio gear I always go for the Sound Devices 744T or it’s bigger brother the 788T. It’s has a LOT of functionality, and therefore could be considered complicated – but the user interface is easy to navigate, and everything in logical. Admittedly it does have one of the world biggest main menu’s – but everything’s in the one place (just like on Avid Media Composer). I would LOVE to own one of these devices – but they’re INCREDIBLY expensive.","The problem however is, that it’s never as simple as just putting a microphone as close to the talent as possible – especially when you’re shooting something without a budget. When we were shooting Happy Sundaes, we filmed in a working ice-cream shop, which was a fantastic location – however because we had lots of lights (ensuring that the images looked great), we couldn’t turn off any of the fridges (as it would melt all the ice cream) – and there were a LOT of fridges in that location! There was no real workaround – so we just needed to make sure we had very directional lapel microphones on everyone, made the actors talk a bit louder than they normally would, and got the boom microphone as close to the talent as possible. In the finished product, you can definitely hear the fridge noise – in fact in some cases we even added more fridge noises to make it sound deliberate – but overall, it doesn’t distract from the story. No one has ever said to me – I had that film because the sound was crap. It’s only after you ask them if could hear the fridges that they twig. That’s the trick – the sound doesn’t need to be Hollywood-grade perfect – it just mustn’t distract from the STORY.","The problem is, that people behind the camera aren’t idiots. They know that sound is REALLY, REALLY hard, and they just don’t want to deal with it.","The Sound Devices 744T is fantastic, and I do truly love it – plus I’ve even MORE excited about the upcoming 664 product release – but these products are all more than four grand, and contain a heap of functionality that I’ll probably never use.","The thing that really annoys me about the current range of audio recorders and wireless gear is that it’s not easily and seamlessly interconnected – so you end up with a mixer bag that’s got so many cables running all over the place that it takes a lot of concentration just to fault find. We need something that’s standalone and self-contained.","The trouble is – these are professional tools. Just like an ARRI Alexa costs as much as a really nice car – these professional audio recorders cost a LOT of money. What’s annoying though, is that the cheaper tools (i.e. H4N, DR-100, etc.) are simply crap. Sure, they can do the job – and yes, I own both a H4N and DR-100, and I’ve captured great audio from them for a number of short film projects – but they’re a pain in the butt, and I consider myself as someone who “gets” audio. Camera operators must REALLY hate these prosumer audio tools!","The whole reason I started writing this though, was to discuss Stu’s blog post – so let’s get back on track.","There are only a few companies who I think could be up to the challenge – Blackmagic, RED, Sound Devices and possibly a new random start-up company funded by Kickstarter(not that this has happened yet). If someone come up with a Kickstart project for a new audio recorder – I’d jump on that in a second. There seems to be plenty of people wanting to build cheap and powerful cameras – so it’s only a matter of time until someone tries to reinvent audio – or at least, I hope so!","There is heaps of useful information out there – so if you really care about high production value – DO YOUR RESEARCH!","Thinking about it, recording good audio is not hard – it just requires a lot of work – just like cinematography. Sure, anyone over the age of about eight can pick up an iPhone and record a movie, edit it on their phone, then upload it to YouTube – but that doesn’t mean the pictures will look good. Capturing pretty pictures is an art – just like capturing good audio. The more you practise at it, the better you get.","This is all technically possible – in fact I’ve seen people doing it in the real world. There are plenty of XLR to iPhone adapters out there now-days, some even with Phantom Power. However, the problem is that you need a complete system. It’s easy to record good audio via an iPod Touch or iPhone – but what would be really cool is if everything was controlled by a master controller, and then once it’s finished recording, everything is automatically uploaded to Dropbox ready for the assistant editors to “attach” to the video files once dumped. It’s the automation an simplicity that’s the key.","This is the essence of Stu’s post – and I couldn’t agree more. Just like the GoPro on the video side – the H4N interface is simply horrible. People in the comments have suggested that the DR-100 is much better, and it is – but only slightly. If anyone’s every used a Cantar– then that’s taking it to a whole other extreme – it’s like operating an Alien space ship! However, camera’s suffer the same problems. The original RED ONE is still a horrible camera to navigate unless you do it all the time (simply because it’s so complex, and there’s so many layers to the menu!). It’s only in the more recent RED EPIC and Scarlet builds has RED finally managed to design an interface that’s logical and has a nice flow to it. I’ve always really liked Sony’s menus (aka the Z1P) and hated Panasonic’s interface (aka the HVX202) – but there are plenty that strongly disagree with me, and prefer Panasonic over Sony. The reality is – designing good GUIs is hard, really hard. Just look at how many people struggled with a good music player interface before the iPod came along!","This is what I cam up with in one evening of pounding keys. But as we’ve established, I’m a lazy idiot. You’re the experts. Come up with stuff that makes my ideas seem trivial and silly.","Until next time… Onwards & Upwards!","We basically had to use every trick in the book – sometimes we used plastic clips to attach the microphones, sometimes we used metal ties to attack the microphones to the girls bra’s, sometimes we taped the microphones to the girl’s skin – it always depended on the shot, the costume and the action. Yes – we had a boom pole in action for every shot as well (some scenes we have three) – but really, you want to try and get every “input” sounding as good as you possibly can, because then you have options. Generally speaking, a boom microphone will always sound better than a lapel – but there are times where you just can’t get a boom close enough.","We need something that’s simple, friendly, flexible and bullet proof.","We need to go back to square one. Someone needs to rework the problems, and offer actual useful and easy-to-use solutions.","What I really want is for Blackmagic to apply the same magic they applied to their BMC, and create a new audio recording solution that sells for $2995. Maybe that’s just the recorder and “base station” and you can buy the wireless packs separately.","When we were filming Hannah & The Hasbian, we shot in one of the actors houses in Prahran. Although the house was quite nice, and it looked pretty good on camera (all things considered – it was a tad too white) – really, we could have shot it anywhere, and would have saved a lot of time and pain if we shot in the country, far away from overhead planes and nearby traffic noise. The story didn’t demand this specific house – so really, we could have and should have shot somewhere else.","While I agree this could be cool – I think having accurate timecode between all devices makes more sense, as that way everything can be on the same page. That’s the beautiful thing about Timecode Buddy– everyone’s iPhone’s and iPad’s can be “in sync” ensuring that everyone can see the notes for the CURRENT shot. Having a good sync point is handy – but having a unique frame accurate reference point is much more useful."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Blackmagic Cinema Camera","p":["Again… We want to give a MASSIVE THANK YOU to John for being so supportive, and allowing us to use his baby for the weekend – and also to Cail and the team at Inspiration Studios for all of their constant help and support. Filmmaking is all about teamwork, and building relationships with like-minded people you can really trust – and the main reason we like to hire gear and get advice from the team at Inspiration is because not only do they have and maintain really great gear – but they spend almost every waking hour researching this tech, and making sure they stay on top of all the latest technology, so that they can help people tell stories with beautiful images. It goes without saying – but all this tech is really irrelevant if you don’t have a good story to shoot. Like I said, our original plan was to just shoot this particular short with a Canon DSLR – but got lucky. At the end of the day it’s not just about the cameras – it’s about the whole package – direction, acting, sound and art department. Having the best camera in the world won’t save a shitty script. However, if you’ve got a great script, then having a decent camera will definitely help!","Although there are a few things that can DEFINITELY be improved in the camera’s software, we were working with a pre-release camera with slightly out-dated firmware, and yet it performed perfectly, and had all the basic features you need to get the job done.","Another big complaint is that you currently cannot format SSD’s from the camera, nor can you delete clips from the camera. Personally – I actually like this. The camera in it’s current form is very limited – but that’s what makes it so simple and easy to use. I like the idea of giving a DOP a camera, and just saying “go and shoot”, and then a DIT deals with all the “data management” later down the line. As Cail mentioned – the lack of visual audio levels is a pain though, and something that hopefully will be addressed soon. I also agree with Ben in that having more white balance options would be handy (even though you can adjust this later down if you shoot DNG).","Another issue I encountered was lenses, due to the size of the sensor, and the nature of the space I was shooting in, I had to use wide lenses, 18mm for wide shots, and 25mm for MCU’s. We had a Compact Prime CP.2 Lense kit for the shoot, supplied by Inspiration Studios.","As a general guide when shooting DNG, the files sizes are about 5MB per frame. We ended up with 1.33 TB of footage from the two day shoot – which equals 2 hours, 56 minutes, 23 seconds and 24 frames worth of footage. To keep file sizes down, we were very strict about when we started rolling the camera – and buttoned on just before slating, and buttoned off straight after the director called cut.","As always, if you have any questions, or if any of the above is unclear – please feel free to leave a message in the comments below, as we would be MORE than happy to answer any questions you have.","Before I wrap things up, I just wanted to discuss a few things that have been discussed in length on Twitter, Facebook and on the Blackmagic Forums. Personally – I don’t think the internal battery is a problem in the slightest – in fact I actually like the idea of having an internal battery in there, as it allows you to do external battery changes without having to power down. The Blackmagic Cinema Camera is kind of like a giant iPhone – and personally, I have no problem with the battery in my iPhone 4. We were using two external batteries for this particular shoot, and we never had any issues – however, I’m told you can get about 90 minutes of live out of the internal battery once it’s fully charged. Given that there are heaps of manufacturers already shipping external battery solutions – I think the lack of an interchangeable battery is a non-issue.","Best Regards, Chris!","CAST:","CREW:","Director: Peter Blackburn Producer: Nicholas Colla Cinematographer: Benjamin Hidalgo De la Barrera Camera Guru: Cail Young Camera Assistant: Elvis Pramod Sound Recordist: Chris Hocking Art Department: Sharon Davis Production Assistant: Kirstie Amarant","From a rental house perspective, at least for us, this is not a camera we will be carrying, as the price point puts it firmly in the owner-operator bracket – but it would be a good investment for anyone looking for an image quality improvement from the 5D and similar cameras.","Hopefully this information has been helpful. There is already a HEAP of other great blog posts and articles out there talking about the camera in detail – but I thought it would be interesting offering up an opinion from people who literally just went out there and shot something with the camera without any real prior planning or testing. It’s true – if we did proper testing prior to the shoot, we probably would have made some different decisions in regards to how we rated the camera in regards to ISO – but that just goes with the territory of no-budget, run-and-gun shoots.","However, because we’re nice guys – we are going to give you a few DNG frames to have a play with, so that you can come up with your own looks in Resolve. What would be really cool is if you post any grades you come up with on the Blackmagic Forums. You can download all of the below images as DNG files here.","I did not have time to shoot tests previously, so I rated it at 800 ISO (manufacturer’s rating), noticed over all noise in low and high lights, but considerably more on blacks. I was able to maintain a base stop of T4 and underexposed everything one stop, I did not find the camera’s screen very reliable as far as exposures is concerned, worked off a on-board Small HD monitor and the rolling shutter is very noticeable when panning and tilting causing severe aberration.","I found the interface very user-friendly, very simple menu, easy to use.","In typical LateNite style – what started out as a really simple idea, quickly blew out of proportion. LateNite director, Alistair Marks wrote the first script – which was very ambitious, especially for a two day shoot – as it had multiple locations, multiple animals, required a rain machine, and called for a LOT of visual effects. But rather than scrap the idea and do something simpler – we decided to just run with it, and see what happens. It was a really fun shoot – with the incredible Caitlin Dooley (a long time friend and collaborator) behind the camera. We’ve worked with Caithlin on many, many shoots previously, but she’s always been focus puller or camera assistant, so it was so great to be able to see her work as the head of department! We shot everything on a Canon 5D, using whatever lights we could scrounge together (2 x 2K Fresnels, a Dedo kit and a ARRI Studio Cool 4-Bank). Jaime Snyder from Pocket Bonfire has recently finished cutting the short, and Michael Shanks is just about to begin visual effects on it later this week. What we had hoped to shoot and finish in two weekends, very quickly blew out to several months – mainly because we’ve been so busy with other things, which was actually good, because the whole reason we were doing this anyway was to just be constantly shooting things and improving our craft. As long as we were shooting something (even if it wasn’t part of the actual “film a month” concept) – that’s all that really mattered. So yes – it’s been a very busy year thus far!","It’s super easy to use – anyone who can operate an iPhone can operate this camera.","Last weekend, we finally shot the 2nd short in the “film a month” series!","Much has been made of the internal, non-removable battery – but from our perspective it’s trivial to mount a V-lock or other professional battery plate and run the camera from that. Two 75Wh batteries and a single charger were more than enough to keep the camera going all day.","Nicole: Emily O’Brien Brown Craig: Lee Beckhurst Fiona: Lelda Kapsis Andy: Charlie Cousins","No grading has been applied to the below images – all I’ve done is simply open them up in Photoshop, and saved them out as JPEGs.","On the whole, it’s no more difficult to build into a camera that will be comfortable to professional DPs and assistants than any DSLR, or even the Epic to be honest – but that isn’t exactly a compliment. The major issue that I see with the physicality of the camera is that all the connectors are on the left hand side, traditionally the ‘operator side’ – which means if you put this thing on your shoulder you will have cables in your face. At least unlike the DSLRs you have full professional I/O on board – HDSDI and balanced analogue audio. If Blackmagic had seen fit to mirror-image the internals of the camera so that the SSD port was on the left and the other ports on the right then they might have dodged this particular bullet.","Once the shoot was over, we used DaVinci Resolve 9 Beta 3 to convert the DNG files to ProRes LT so that we can offline in Adobe Premiere CS6 (on a side note – this will be our first proper short film we’re cutting in Premiere – wish us luck!). We did have some issues getting Resolve to render things out in bulk – and we also noticed that we were getting faster renders on our MacBook Pro than our iMac (which is just plain odd) – but generally speaking everything worked fairly well. We ended up just doing a straight export out of Resolve, without applying any colour correction – although Cail at Inspiration did do his own one-light pass of everything for their own internal workflow tests, just to see how everything worked (the screenshot above is from Cail). After converting everything to ProRes LT – we ended up with 111.08 GB of ProRes LT transcodes.","One of the things I really wanted to test out, but didn’t get a chance was to try and record timecode to one of the audio tracks on the camera. Unfortunately there was just not enough time to do tests, so in the end we just went with a really traditional split system audio recording. We hired a Sound Devices 788T from our good friends Soundequip– which is a beautiful piece of machinery – in fact if it wasn’t so expensive, I’d buy one today. We used four Sennheiser wireless lapels on our four cast (using a mishmash of all kinds of different lapel microphones), a Rode NT3 at the primary microphone (people often laugh when I tell them I use that on a boom – but it actually sounds really nice to my ear!) and an Sennheiser ME66 for scenes where I couldn’t get the NT3 in close. Shooting something near the city with traffic noise in the background, planes flying overhead constantly, and trains going past on a regular basis is never easy – and shooting in a town house also add’s to the problems, as the sound generally bounces everywhere – but hopefully we got some half-decent audio!","One thing I do wish though,is that they would have added the ability to easily record external timecode to the camera. Hopefully they will be able to do this in a later firmware release, using the audio jack inputs. Really though – until that happens, you can always just record the timecode to the audio track, just like we currently do on DSLRs.","One thing I must mention is it’s dynamic range, manufacturer states it’s 13 stops, as I said I didn’t have time to shoot tests, but i did expose using it’s full latitude, can’t wait to jump on that grade!","Onwards & Upwards!","Overall I like the camera, it was easy working with it, I do feel that this camera isn’t designed for cinematographers and what we do, but rather it is designed to compete with cameras such as the Canon 5D. Having that in mind this is an awesome camera, being able to shoot 2.5 RAW for that price is impressive. Would be nice if it had a bigger sensor though.","Peter Blackburn is the Programs Coordinator at 16th Street Acting Studios(which is where our office is based), and is a very talented writer – so we thought this would be a really great opportunity for him to try out directing a short film for the first time. He’s been involved in the film industry for a really long time – but has never taken the plunge into directing… until now! He came up with a fairly simple script (at least in terms of logistics) – all set in one location – a townhouse – with four actors.","STOCKHOLMexplores three brief moments in the lives of two couples, all close friends. The film’s title references the syndrome in which captives begin to feel empathy, even love, for their captors. So too, the film’s characters hide emotional and psychological damage that unites them to partners – partners who, in many ways, hold them hostage to their dysfunctional behaviour. As the film opens, Nicole and Craig have discovered they are pregnant with their first child. They invite their close friends Andy and Fiona over for a celebratory dinner to announce the good news. The dinner party offers usual banter of middle-class, white-collar professionals but with an undercurrent of innuendo, power games and suspicions. Developing the short was very much a collaborative, improvised process inspired by the work of Mike Leigh. The results are that the scenes are not scripted, but rather derived from a process of distilled improvisation, where intention, motivation and scenario drive the actors to always surprising moments and interactions, which supports highly naturalistic dialogue and behaviours.","The camera is built like a brick – very solid.","The film is very dark, and quite full on – and to be honest, it’s not really something LateNite would normally tackle (generally speaking all of our films are quite positive, quirky and funny), but the script is extremely powerful and challenging – and the cast that Peter put together are just amazing. It features Emily O’Brien Brown (from Hannah & The Hasbian), and Lee Beckhurst (from Fallout& One Flu North) who are both long time LateNite collaborators – and are incredibly talented young actors (and always an absolute joy to work with!). They were joined by two new-comers (although not strangers!) to LateNite, Lelda Kapsis and Charlie Cousins.","The only major software issue I could see (and perhaps this has been fixed in the shipping firmware) is that there is no indicator of how much media you have used – there is only a status readout that tells you when the drive is “nearly full”, with no further information available. A smaller issue is that the audio controls do not have any visible meters – which makes it very hard to line up an external mixer.","There have also been lots of complaints about the lack of DNxHD support in the current shipping release of the software – but as Avid can support ProRes natively via AMA anyway – it’s not really an issue. Personally – as someone who has a day job in Post Production – I really like this camera. It’s simple, easy-to-use, and because of it’s RAW capability, it’s extremely powerful when the time comes to grade the footage. Anyone who has used RED, is used to having to transcode their rushes prior to an offline – so transcoding your DNG’s to ProRes/DNxHD isn’t really a problem. Blackmagic publicly stated though, that DNxHD encoding is not too far away.","This is NOT an RED Scarlet or Alexa replacement, but if you have a no-budget shoot, or if you need a decent “B Camera”, then this is a fantastic option. This camera is incredibly cheap for what it does – but at the end of the day you get what you pay for.","This is probably going to be a fairly long blog post, so let’s just start with my personal conclusion in regards to the Blackmagic Cinema Camera:","This shoot was very much run and gun – we didn’t really have time to do any camera tests, we basically got the camera on set, recorded a single clip to make sure that the two SanDisk 240GB Extreme SSDs we bought the day before actually worked, and then started shooting. We just had to assume the camera would work – and luckily it performed perfectly.","To give you another perspective, here’s Benjamin Hidalgo’s feedback after using the camera for two days:","To give you some backstory… At the start of this year, we had the (in retrospect silly) idea to shoot a nice and simple short film on the first weekend of every month, mainly for fun. The plan was to give friends that have helped us out in the past the opportunity to write their own script, and direct or act in it if they wanted. The scripts needed to be really simple – as we needed to shoot the whole thing over a single weekend, with only the gear we could borrow off friends. The intention was to edit and finish them the by the end of the following weekend. We also planned to give friends the opportunity to “step up” into bigger crew positions – for example, we wanted to get people who normally work with us as camera assistants to jump on board as cinematographers.","To shoot this particular short – we decided to call upon a very long term collaborator and great friend of LateNite to shoot the film – the unquestionably talented and unstoppable Benjamin Hidalgo De la Barrera. Ben has shot many of our short films and videos clips in the past – and it’s always an absolute extreme pleasure to work with him. We’ve also thrown poor Ben in the deep end plenty of times before – we shot the SAKOOZ trailer on the RED ONE, when it had only been in Australia for a few weeks and was very much a “beta” product (with all kinds of workflow quirks!). We shot with the Canon 5D when it was only weeks old – back before it offered 25fps recording – so he’s used to a challenge!","To summarise what gear we had, here’s a direct quote from Cail Young from Inspiration Studios:","Tried using the focus assist on the camera, but overall it wasn’t very useful.","We haven’t started cutting the footage together yet (that’s tomorrow’s mission!) – nor have we had a proper play at grading the footage. We’re planning to do a proper grade in Resolve though, and see what results we can get out of the camera.","We only had two SanDisk 240GB Extreme SSDs on set, so we had to dump footage throughout the day. We used a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2011, Model 8,2, OS X 10.8, 2.5GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, AMD Radeon HD 6770M 1024MB, Apple SSD TS256C) as the data wrangling machine – hooked up to a Promise Pegasus R6 Thunderbolt RAID(I get about 505.2 MB/s write and 481.5 MB/s read), a 2TB Thunderbolt LaCie Little Big Disk(I get about 72.9 MB/s write and 43.7 MB/s read), and a SONNET Express/34 Thunderbolt Adapter with an eSATA Card. Connected to the eSATA card was a Lacie enclosure that was taken apart so that I could use it as a make-shift docking station, and a super cheap Welland Ezstor tool-free SATA Enclosure. Using ShotPut Pro, I copied media from the SSD in the Lacie enclosure to the Thunderbolt Lacie and Thunderbolt Pegasus. Once all the data was copied to the drives, and double checked using “Get Info” – I formatted the SanDisk SSD using Disk Utility and handed it back to the Camera Assistant. I then copied the files from the Pegasus to the SATA Enclosure, which contained a 2TB SATA drive as a 3rd backup (which is stored at another location than the main Thunderbolt drives). Sometime within the next week or so, we’ll move the files from the Thunderbolt Lacie to an LTO5 for archiving purposes. Everything went really smooth in terms of data wrangling – we just dumped a card when it was full, except towards the end of each day, when we started dumping more often to ensure that we only have a few shots to do by the time we wrapped – so no one had to wait around at the end of the day waiting for things to copy. It took about 40 minutes to dump a SSD to the two Thunderbolt drives.","We originally planned to shoot this film on a Canon 7D – because that’s all we had lying around at the time, but whilst we were dropping back a EPIC we borrowed from our good friends at Inspiration Studios earlier in the week (stay tuned for Michael Shanks next YouTube video, which is currently in post!), Cail Young mentioned that Australian cinematographer John Brawley has lent them his pre-release Blackmagic Cinema Camera so that they could do some workflow tests, and if we wanted to have a play with the camera we were more than welcome to. And so, as you can imagine, we jumped at the opportunity, and Cail brought along the camera for us to use for the shoot to see how the camera actually performs in the “real world”.","We received the BMCC from John Brawley with a full rig, including an Alphatron EVF and a Bebob prototype cage for the camera, as well as a Bright Tangerine ‘Strummer’ mattebox. We kept the Bebob cage on as it was a very solid way of working with the camera in a professional production environment, giving you a proper top handle, Arri-compatible dovetail on the bottom, and threaded holes everywhere for accessories. After some evaluation at our facility, we decided to swap out our Arri MMB-1 mattebox for the Bright Tangerine as the Bright Tangerine was a demo unit without flaps and we couldn’t fit anything we had to it. We also provided an Arri FF-5 Cine followfocus and a SmallHD DP6-SDI for onboard monitoring in addition to the rear touchscreen.","We want to give a MASSIVE THANK YOU to John for being so supportive, and allowing us to use his baby for the weekend – and also to Cail and the team at Inspiration Studios for organising all the camera gear, and making sure all our post workflows were in place to handle the masses of data.","We’ve pre-ordered a camera – but mainly as a DSLR replacement, for behind the scenes footage, interviews, run-and-gun no-budget shoots, etc. We’ll continue to use rented cameras (i.e. EPIC’s and Alexa’s) for anything with a budget.","You can only select set white balance temperatures, would be nice to be able to punch in a desired temperature rather than the presets it already has."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Swinburne Lecture August 2012","p":["25 fps (and other new frame rates) in digital cinemas","A CRU drive is a SATA-II hard drive enclosed in a DX-115 hard drive carriage.

I was told that one of my hero’s, the amazing Edgar Wright executive produced it (which basically was the big selling point for me!) – but apart from that all I knew is that it was “bloody” and I assumed it was going to be a comedy. Well… It was definitely bloody – and it definitely had lots of funny moments. However, this is one really bizarre and screwed up film!","The film opens with Tina (played by Alice Lowe who incidentally also plays a “Tina” in one of my favourite movies of all time – Hot Fuzz) and her Mum in a very typical old English house. This is when you realise as an audience member – this film is going to have that very unique dark British humour (aka Black Books and another MIFF film from a few years back I really loved, Severance) that’s pretty much all character driven, and that there will be a lot of awkward moments and strange conversations in this film!","The general gist is… Tina has a new boyfriend called Chris ( Steve Oram) – a cheery bloke with ginger hair and a “big bushy beard” (to quote Hot Fuzz, just because I can). Chris is absolutely hated by Tina’s older Mother, because like most parents who have only one child – she doesn’t want her little baby girl to leave the nest, especially when there’s no one else around to keep her company. But, even before Chris arrived though, it wasn’t a happy household. Tina basically acts as her Mother’s maid – as the loving Mother-daughter connection was severely damaged after Tina accidentally killed her Mum’s number one love in live, her little puppy. Her Mum’s still mourning – and really resents the fact that Chris is taking away her daughter at this really upsetting time. Given all this, Chris just wants to get Tina out of the house, on a journey through the English countryside in his beloved Abbey Oxford Caravan. Tina has led a very sheltered life – and there are things that Chris really wants her to see, such as the Crich Tramway Village, the Ribblehead Viaduct, the Keswick Pencil Museum and the stunning countryside in between.","The trip unlocks Tina’s sensuality and the couple enjoy lovemaking that really rocks the caravan. What starts off as quite a nice little off-beat romantic holiday together quickly turns a tad dark and nasty, when we discover that Chris has quite an anger management problem – and basically kills anyone that rubs him the wrong way. He has morals – and if someone is rude enough to litter, then that person must be dealt with.","And then as the film goes on, it gets stranger, and darker – as the body count slowly rises. They also pick up a really cute little dog on the way.","This film is quite entertaining, as the two lead characters are great – but it’s also really bizarre. I’ve read that people have compared it to Hot Fuzz – and although it does have elements of the same sort of off-beat British humour – the pace is absolutely opposite, and the comedy is a little bit more dark and creepy.","To be perfectly honest – I’m not sure what the point of this film is, or whether it even has a point. Sightseers is quite funny and well made, but it’s also a tad predictable, and the encounters between the two lead “antiheroes” and stereotypical sketch-comedy “posh” characters is just a bit “too easy”. That said, there are some seriously funny moments, some great “one liners”, and also some overly graphic violence happening in quite comic situations that you can’t help to laugh at. I mean, who doesn’t want to laugh at someone getting their head smashed in with a giant bashing stick?","The film is essentially a low-budget road-movie, and it has some fantastic “real life” locations. The cinematographer Laurie Rose, has mainly done lots of TV work – but despite this, the film certainly has a great cinematic look. The pictures look great, and the production design is really simple, but consistent and sticks in with the style of the film.","I haven’t seen any of Ben Wheatley’s(the director) other work – but I definitely want to check it out. Although this isn’t a masterpiece of a film – it was still enjoyable, and it would be really intriguing to see what other work he’s done in the past.","This isn’t even close to being on the same playing field as Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz – but if you’re into Edgar Wright-esk comedy, then you will probably quite enjoy this film. It’s quirky, it’s weird, it’s pretty sick at times, but it does have a really cute dog."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"HAIL","p":["After the huge success of CICADA (which had it’s international premiere at the highly prestigious Cannes Film Festival in 2009), they started developing a feature film project – but Amiel soon realised that for a feature film, the really interesting thing for him was not the crime element of the Danny’s life – but more the passion and love between Danny and Leanne. And so, instead of filming a documentary, Amiel decided to blur the lines between cinema and reality, and using Danny’s real life as a base, together they constructed a story that had elements of what really happened once Danny was released from prison, combined with fictional elements to heighten the love story element.","Being a documentary filmmaker, Amiel decided to use real people instead of actors, and spent three months rehearsing the film, so that the cast in the film could use language they were comfortable with to eliminate any signs of “bad acting” which sometimes comes with non-actors. The acting in this film is phenomenal – it has some of the most powerful performances of any film I’ve ever seen – probably because it’s so hard to tell what’s real, and what’s manufactured. Everything that happens in the film is loosely based on fact, stories Dan has been told by others – so every element of this film has a deep seated reality to it. It’s a film told by real people, who have had these actual experiences, replaying themselves for the camera.","Hail has screened all over the world to great reviews – however despite being made in Melbourne, MIFF 2012 is it’s Melbourne Premiere – so as you can imagine, the ACMI theatre was absolutely packed out, so the atmosphere in the room was fantastic. A lot of people have been waiting a very long time to see this film! ACMI is one of the best theatres in Melbourne – it has great projection and fantastic sound, so it was the perfect place to have the premiere.","Hail is essentially a love story about Dan and Leanne. The film opens with Dan getting released from prison early due to good behaviour, and he comes home to the love of his life, Leanne, who wasn’t expecting him home quite so soon. Things start off great – they’re soul mates, and extremely thankful to be back into each others arms. After several failed attempts, Dan eventually gets a job, and things are really looking up. But after a minor workplace accident in which Dan hurts his arm, slowly but surely, his world starts to fall apart, as Dan and Leanne go back to their old criminal ways so they can sustain their diet of alcohol and cigarettes. Dan’s happiness spirals downwards, as he grows to further hate the world he lives in, getting constantly more angry and frustrated, with only Leanne to take it out on. One night, after Leanne and Dan have a fight, Dan returns to discover one of Leanne’s old friends at their home, who offers Dan a job transporting drugs. Dan’s really not happy with this, but goes along to keep Leanne happy – but in the morning, Dan’s world comes crashing to a halt when he discovers the love of his life, has overdosed. Broken, angry and devastated, Dan then goes on a mission to revenge his wife’s death.","Hail is full on. It’s graphic, it’s intense, it’s real.","I can’t wait to see what Amiel & Michael come up with next!","I’ve been waiting to see this film for a very, very, very long time. Admittedly, it’s not the kind of film I would normally seek out to see – as I’m not the biggest fan of drug use and graphic violence up there on the big screen – in fact watching people injecting themselves really freaks me out. But this is a film that I’ve had the privilege of “following” for a very long time because it was edited at The Butchery(where I work three days a week, when I’m not doing LateNite things), by one of my favourite editors and people in the world, the incredible Peter Sciberras(who now works for Method Studios). Because of this, I got to see the glimpses of rushes as they came in, rough cuts every now and again, and also witness just how hard the director, Amiel Courtin-Wilson and producer Michael Cody worked to get this film up and finished. I really didn’t have much to do with the film apart from fixing things in the edit suite when they broke, and making sure that Pete could get on and do what he does best, but I’m so glad I played a small part, because this is one very special film.","It’s also very poetic and strangely beautiful.","Luckily, Hail will be having a very limited theatrical release soon, and will then be released to the home DVD market – so I HIGHLY recommend you check this out. You definitely have to be in the right zone to watch this film – because it’s not really a happy film, but it’s just so well done, it would be a real shame not to see it.","Obviously I’m biased – but I just thought the editing of this film was absolutely incredible. There are scenes are are incredibly intense and almost overwhelming, but they are carefully crafted to just be long enough – with calmness straight after, so that you have time to catch your breathe. The sound design by Robert Mackenzie is also incredibly intense, but also so beautifully and carefully crafted. There are moments in the film where you could hear a pin drop, and others, when you think “one more second and my head is going to explode”. Music plays a massive role in the film (original score by Steve Benwell) – as it almost plays a bridge between scenes.","Sadly, I’ve only been able to see a few films at MIFF this year – but I’m so glad that this was one of them. I think it’s going to take me a few days to process what I’ve seen – and admittedly, I probably could have come up with a better crafted blog post if I’d let my feelings sit and process for a few days first – but this is the kind of film that really sparks emotion, and generates all kinds of feelings. There was definitely a million things running through my head on the drive home!","The thing I really loved about Hail was that the story telling was so powerful. From the opening shot in the film, to the very end, you’re glued to the screen. It also really takes you on a roller-coaster. The film starts off quite happy, quirky, funny and positive, but rapidly spirals downwards as Dan’s world, basically just turns to shit. One of the most interesting elements of this film is that as the film descends into dispair, so too does the editing style, sound design and content – for instance, half way through the film, you see a dead horse flying through the sky – a metaphor for what’s happening in Dan’s world.","This is just a really powerful film. It’s intense, it’s graphic, and it really makes you feel for the characters, and also makes you release how lucky you are. Amiel does such a good job of setting up Danny as a character you want to really like, but at the same time, some of the things he does, and the madness he develops makes you really question your judgement.","This is the kind of film that really affects you – as you walk out of the cinema, you feel like you’ve not only learnt something, but you been given a unique insight into someone else’s world and mind. It’s absolutely full on – but in a good way. It’s not a happy film, it’s not a popcorn film – this is real life, in the roughest and darkest parts of town.","To give you some back story, back in 2005, the director Amiel first met Daniel P. Jones (the main actor in the film) whilst shooting documentary on “Plan B” – a Melbourne based theatre company founded to rehabilitate ex-prison inmates through performance. Danny had been released the previous day from prison and arrived at a Plan B rehearsal to take part in that year’s performance. Amiel became really interested in Danny, because – well, he really is quite a character! He has a really black sense of humour, and a really interesting way of looking at the world. Amiel decided that Danny’s life and stories would make a really interesting documentary, and so they spent more and more time with each other, filmmaking interviews when they could. Eventually some of the stories of Danny’s childhood, life on the streets and life in jail was channelled into an extremely successful short film called CICADA.","Visually, the film is gritty and real. Shot on Super 16mm – the film looks stunning. Almost everything is hand held – keeping with the documentary feel. The cinematographer, Germain McMicking also shot Wilfred (one of my favourite all time shows) – so there’s no surprise there!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"adventures-in-asia","l":"Adventures in Asia!","p":["In 2010, LateNite documentary film-maker Jacqui Hocking started working with social entrepreneur Ashwin Subramaniam, the young founder of the GoneAdventurin’ Social Enterprise.

Big Things Grow.","p":["MIFF Weekend #1","So after a cracking start to the festival it was time to indulge in my first weekend at MIFF which usually results in five to eight films spanned across two very long days. I was a little bit excited for this first weekend however as one of the films that I had at the very top of my wish list for this festival was the documentary Paul Kelly: Stories or Me which I had booked in on the Saturday night. But before I start getting all excited about that, first up was the Australian horror/comedy 100 Bloody Acres.","The great thing about this film from debut feature directors Colin & Cameron Cairnes is that it doesn’t hide from what it really is. It’s a gross out, in your face, borderline b grade horror film which I would liken to something like the New Zealand film Black Sheep(MIFF 2007). The concept is quite simple. A trio of young travelers are on their way out into the country for a music festival before their car breaks down. They are picked up by the incredibly endearing Reg who runs an organic ‘blood and bone’ fertiliser business with his brother Lindsey and who is in need of a fresh supply of their ‘secret ingredient’ for the fertiliser as stocks are low.","This film has more laugh out loud moments than I have seen in an Australian film for some time now and is essentially a very simple concept that is well crafted by it’s directors. If I had one qualm it would be that I felt the acting let the film down a little bit. The more experienced actors in Angus Sampson, Damon Herriman and John Jarratt (particular mention to Herriman who is incredible as the bumbling Reg) do a fantastic job but unfortunately the same can’t be said for the films younger actors. They arn’t bad by any stretch but I just feel that perhaps they were all miscast in their roles and the film might’ve gained from some different casting choices. Nevertheless I still had a great time watching the film which is sure to become a cult horror comedy and do well on the festival circuit. Unfortunately the screening left a bad taste in my mouth after the crash and burn Q & A which was hosted by a complete dickhead and which suffered from people asking dumb questions about neck beards.","And then the big one.","Now before I talk about the movie I just wanted to highlight exactly why I was so excited about this documentary. I have loved Paul Kelly’s music for as long as I remember and have seen him perform live more times than any other live music act. Reason being is that I think that he is one of the greatest Australian artists and storytellers of our time. His music speaks of love, loss, youth and many aspects of life in a way which is most affecting and accessible.","The documentary made by filmmaker Ian Darling not only pays tribute to the man and his life but also tells the story of what it is to be an artist, and why it is so important in our world to have people like Paul Kelly. The music is carefully chosen and placed and the doco jumps between live footage from concerts, interviews with family, friends and other musicians and old footage of the early days of Paul Kelly. I think the thing that I enjoyed most about this doco was how they used certain elements to really highlight how Paul’s songs so closely follow his own life. As each moment in the film dealt with an important moment in Paul Kelly’s life, the lyrics of his song were written in front of the footage, again showing that Paul’s strength in his music is that he writes from the heart, from his own experiences, even though in the doco he cheekily denies writing anything but fiction.","This is without doubt one of the best MIFF experiences that I have had. Not only was the doco brilliant but the audience was buzzing with Paul Kelly fans who were so excited to see a film about their hero. As the film ended and the director took the stand for a Q & A, he did something else that warmed my heart. Before speaking, Ian Darling invited his crew up on stage and acknowledged them all – something that is not done enough, especially in Australian film. We often forget how many people it takes to craft a film so it was really great to see Ian do that. If I have one qualm about the whole thing it was the little prick in front of me who decided to check the footy scores mid film. I’ve never done it before but I did the angry kick of the back of his seat. Sometimes I just wish I had a cattle prod.","Day two for MIFF weekend number one started off with another film featuring one of the kings of the American mumblecore movement in Mark Duplass (see Safety Not Guaranteed), Your Sister’s Sister. This was an interesting one for me cause I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The film begins with Iris (Emily Blunt) inviting her deeply depressed friend Jack (Duplass) to stay at her fathers island cabin for the weekend after the death of his brother. At the cabin, Jack runs into Iris’ sister Hannah who has gone up to the cabin for a similar reason and after a drunken encounter a revealing stretch of days ensues.","The funny thing about this film, being that it was in a similar vein to Safety Not Guaranteed, which was another American Indie that I saw on Friday night, was that it had completely opposite issues to SNG. The film featured stunning performances from it’s leads Emily Blunt, Mark Duplass and Rosemarie DeWitt but unfortunately I felt the script needed a bit more work. I just felt that the writer and director Lynn Shelton needed to choose her moments a little more closely as I found the pacing was all over the place. When I wanted the story to progress it seemed to linger, when I wanted more it seemed to wrap up far too quickly. Worth seeing for the performances though as they really are beautiful to watch on screen.","The second film I caught was The Sessions. A film which I wasn’t totally looking forward to after reading a friends review of the first session from a few days back. I gotta be honest, I was completely and utterly blown away by a really beautiful piece of low budget filmmaking.","The film is based on an essay called Seeing A Sex Surrogate written by Mark O’Brien, a man who suffered from polio and spent most of his days living in an iron lung. The film follows Mark (played by John Hawkes) as he decides he wants to lose his virginity despite his condition. This quest leads him to Cheryl Cohen Greene, a professional sex surrogate who helps him to explore intimacy and sex. I found this film to be so affecting due to brilliant performances from it’s leads John Hawkes and Helen Hunt. The film could’ve been very in your face but the choices from director Ben Lewin (an Australian) were spot on as he treated the subject with a respect and humour which made the subject matter all the more accessible for it’s audience. I really can’t encourage you enough to go out and see this film. It’s a beautiful, inspirational story about the human condition. Also stars William H Macy.","I finished my weekend off with a screening of the Swedish film Flicker, from Academy Award nominee Patrik Eklund. Now I don’t know if I was far too tired or that I really wasn’t in the mood for zany Swedish comedy but I really didn’t like this film. When it was funny, it was really funny but I found those moments to be few and far between. It seemed like Eklund had all these wonderful ideas for these characters and then when it came to weaving a story and a world for them all to exist in, he panicked. The film is about people trying to find their place in modern society but I just didn’t care about any of the characters which made it hard for me to engage with what the hell was going on. I will drop a mention for the sequence with the woman in therapy over her fear of spiders just before the lights go out – clever set up.","So that’s it for the weekend – I have taken Monday off to go and earn some of that sweet sweet cash but will be back on the bandwagon come Tuesday for Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom (I can feel the erection already) and the Beastie Boys doco Awesome, I Fuckin Shot That.","Massive win."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"the-day-i-remembered-my-childhood","l":"The Day I Remembered My Childhood.","p":["MIFF Day 6.","What can you say about Wes Anderson that hasn’t already been said. The man has made a career of making films that are, on viewing, unmistakably his own. Everything from his storybook like cinematography, to his bold production design, to his beautifully crafted soundtracks, to the performance style he enforces on his actors. Wes Anderson is indeed an Auteur in the truest sense of the word.","Whenever you watch an Anderson film you are taken to what feels like a fantastical world and although the subject of his films are quite often dysfunctional, there is a whimsical nature to them that makes these characters and scenarios completely endearing and accessible to it’s audience. Rather than force an opinion on you, Anderson treats his audience with a respect and intelligence that allows them to connect with the characters and the material that they best relate to. It’s a skill often ignored in modern day cinema, but when someone like Anderson makes it work, tis a powerful tool.","His new film Moonrise Kingdom is no exception to that rule. A film about two young lovers who escape their New England town in 1965, which results in a local search party’s journey to find them, is a film that brilliantly deals with being young, naive, in love and without fear. It manages to very subtly show the difference between living in an adult world and then the world of a child. One that is fueled by their imagination. I watched this film and couldn’t help but be filled with absolute joy and happiness as I watched these two brilliant young actors on screen remind us of what it is like to be a kid. I often think about when we lose that naivety. When we all stop living in the moment and start living with fear and, I guess in some sense, in reality. The world through a child’s eyes is such a unique thing, and one that we should all be so lucky to be exposed to.","There is not much more I can say about Moonrise Kingdom that would serve as a reason for you to go and see it. All I know is that for an hour and a half, I was completely lost in my imagination and by the end of the film, you couldn’t wipe the smile off my face. Stars a typically “Anderson” cast which includes Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and new comers to the Anderson corner Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and Bob Balaban.","Just to make sure I kept up that reminiscent nature of my evening, my next film was a concert style doco on the Beastie Boys, a band I listened to all through high school. After the sad passing of Adam Yauch (MCA) earlier this year, MIFF had decided to show a couple of Beastie Boys doco’s and shorts that were directed by Yauch. The cinema was packed and the screening was kicked off with the hilarious short Fight For Your Right Revisted which I saw for the first time on youtube only a few months back. The short is a really funny “post video clip film” starring so many A-list celebrities that it’s just not possible to mention them all in the one post. I suggest you watch for yourself below:","Anyway after the short was the Beasties doco Awesome, I Fuckin Shot That which was a concert doco that was constructed by the band giving 50 fans at the concert a video camera to shoot their own experience at the 2004 Madison Square Garden concert in New York. What I thought was a good idea in theory was sometimes brilliant but sometimes a bit too much. Perhaps it was the time at night, perhaps I was a touch too tired from other screenings and work, or perhaps it was just plain and simple due to the lo-fi video and the MTV cutting style that my brain just couldn’t handle it. The sequences where the shots were held for longer worked fantastically but unfortunately the quick fire cuts in majority of the opening were just a bit much.","The last 20 minutes or so when the boys are running around backstage for their epic encore of Intergalactic and Sabotage were my favourite as they ran around interacting with the audience in the stands. It also helps that those are two of my favourite Beasties songs.","For the next couple of days my schedule consists of Side by Side, which is a filmmaking doco dealing with the film vs digital debate, Killer Joe which apparently is a little more messed up than I anticipated and Dark Horse, the Todd Solondz film which I’ve been hearing mixed things about…","See you in a couple of days team!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"australias-ron-howard","l":"Australia’s Ron Howard","p":["…or Why Our Safety Is Not Guaranteed.","A really simple idea and execution which works thanks to clever writing, a willingness to take risks and some pitch perfect performances by some of its young cast. The film follows a group of young journalists who have gone to a seaside town to investigate a man who has put an ad in the paper looking for someone to travel back in time with him. What starts off as an attempt to write a story about a man quite obviously disconnected with reality becomes a journey about loss, love, getting old and making mistakes.","After a bit of a false start to do with a couple of screening issues, the film started at a cracking pace and did not let up for the entirety of its near 2 hour running time. If this is just a taste of what ABC is going to begin to program over the next little while then I am excited. The films (I like that better than telemovie) are based on the Peter Temple novels of the same name and are adapted by one of Australia’s most respected screen writers in Andrew Knight. It follows Jack Irish (Pearce) a former Government lawyer turned private detective who spends his time digging up dark secrets of others whilst trying to keep his own at bay.","And as for Jeff? Well after having a brief word with him on Opening Night it looks like he has been kicking some serious goals both here and abroad which is exciting as there is no man more deserving of success then Australia’s very own version of Ron Howard, Jeffrey Walker.","Anyway from the early start directing kid’s TV, Jeff has gone on to direct some of Australia’s most respected dramas and comedies including All Saints, City Homicide, Rake, Small Time Gangster, Angry Boys and most recently the Jack Irish telemovies for ABC1 starring Hollywood Superstar Guy Pearce.","As this blog post has already been a bit of a big one I’ll keep the next review short and sharp (which hopefully the rest will be throughout MIFF). The film I saw after Jack Irish was the American Indie Safety Not Guaranteed. Now for those that know me, I have a bit of a soft spot for indie films in general. Films like Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, Garden State, Tiny Furniture, 50/50 get me all excited in the pantaloons. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that these films deal with very human issues but often approach them with delicateness and a self-depreciating humour that gives the subject matter lightness and makes them more accessible for an audience. They often take you by surprise and affect you in a way that you weren’t expecting when you paid your 15 bucks at the box office to go and see it.","I also had a soft spot as the film was made on a shoestring budget of 750,000, which in America is loose change. It’s the writing and performances which make this film - and not the big budget special effects.","In short I really enjoyed the first of two Jack Irish films. I think everyone involved with the film should be proud of what they have managed to put together on (no doubt) a modest budget. Do yourself a favour and keep a look out for them when they screen on ABC1 later in the year.","Jeff has been around film his entire life. In fact I think most of you reading this blog post will remember him as the brilliant little kid playing Bronson in the earlier series of Around The Twist. Or if not that perhaps his parts in Ocean Girl, Thunderstone, Halfway Across The Galaxy and Turn Left or The Wayne Manifesto. Basically this guy was the children’s television of my generation. So how excited was I when I discovered that this young dude was gonna be directing me in a block of episodes on a kid’s series called Holly’s Heroes way back in 2004.","Needless to say I was a touch excited that the latter was to be my first official MIFF screening of 2012.","One of the very great examples of this is a man I had the pleasure of being directed by on a number of occasions when he was only 21, and that man’s name is Jeffrey Walker.","Safety Not Guaranteed was no exception.","That’s all from me - tomorrow night my MIFF Odyseey continues with Monsieur Lazhar, 100 Bloody Acres & Paul Kelly: Stories of Me.","The amazing thing about Jeff is he manages to keep this unique sense of calm and trust amongst his crew and actors without raising a sweat. When we first found out that he was on board to do Holly’s a couple of actors in the cast had worked with him on another show and they were all so excited that he was going to join us. Even back then at the stupidly young age of 21, I was in awe of how he worked and I have had nothing but absolute respect for him ever since. I guess you could say he has been somewhat of a local hero for me.","The film isn’t perfect by any stretch with some gaps in the writing and also the performances however overall they really hit the mark. When the writing is good it is fantastic and it’s near impossible to not be drawn to all four of the main characters who are all dealing with their own personal demons. I wouldn’t recommend it for everyone but if you’re the kind of person who finds these kinds of films affecting (like I do) then it’s a must see.","The film starred an impressive cast (particular mention to the brilliant Aaron Pedersen) who all give stellar performances throughout the film thanks to great direction by Walker. As I said above, the film’s pace really doesn’t let up throughout and has a certain feel to it that is removed from the endless pile of TV crime drama’s that we’ve seen over the past few years (see Underbelly 1 through to 86). There is almost a voyeuristic approach in how the film is shot with Walker opting to hold on wides and allow the action to play out as Jack is forced to meet with a whole range of colourful characters that make up the corrupt world that he is investigating.","The film was dark but not without humour with every bit of wit that has been worked into the dialogue by Knight and co-writer Matt Cameron being perfectly played out by the films actors.","The great thing about growing up in the world in which you want to work is that as you get older you start to see friends and people you have worked with in your past start to break through. It’s such a warm feeling to have as in an industry fueled by ego and people that are looking for a cheap shot at fame and fortune, it is always the driven, talented ones without that sense of entitlement who are humbled by what we do that start to excel. Because at the end of the day whether you be involved in music, fine art, theatre, film or any other creative endeavor, it is about telling stories."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"soul-sister-brown-sugar","l":"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar.","p":["MIFF Opening Night. Best in Years.","So it’s probably no surprise for you to all hear that I love the Melbourne International Film Festival. Every year I get super excited when the festival comes around cause it literally allows me to go nuts and watch 50 odd movies in just 19 short days. Some might call it crazy, I think it’s bloody brilliant.","The thing about the film festival is that unfortunately the Opening Night parties and screenings have lacked a little in previous years. Last year’s The Fairy was a cute little French film, but not an Opening Night crowd pleaser and the after party was not a patch on previous years due to there being a number of different rooms for VIP’s etc which kinda took the fun out of the whole thing as the crowd seemed tiny and the year before that we saw The Wedding Party(formerly Kin) which was unfortunately not a great film. So how excited was I when I discovered the Opening Night film would be The Sapphires and that the party would return from the town hall to its original location at the Regent Ballroom.","And MIFF, good by you, you did not disappoint.","The film itself was a genuine crowd pleaser and I tip my hat the all involved with the film as it’s the first Australian film (excepting Red Dog) in a long time that I think will find a big audience. It’s a story that is undeniably Australian and one that is treated with humour, respect and love by it’s filmmakers. I think the thing that I most enjoyed was that the humour wasn’t overplayed (see numerous Australian comedies) and the film didn’t feel like it alienated its audience like I feel most Australian films do. Most importantly, it had hope. Hope which shone through a story which dealt with war, the stolen generation, lost loved ones, racism and generally a dark time in our past.","The film itself is based on the play of the same name which was written by Tony Briggs whose mother Laurel Robinson was in the actual Sapphires. The real Sapphires were a quartet of Koori women who toured Vietnam during the war to entertain the troops.","I think the wonderful thing about this film in particular is it is a big celebration of the indigenous talent that we have in Australian as the film not only stars four brilliant indigenous actresses in Deborah Mailman, Shari Sebbens, Miranda Tapsell and Jessica Mauboy, but also has an outstanding production crew of indigenous talent in director Wayne Blair, screenwriter Tony Briggs and cinematographer Warwick Thornton who directed the critically acclaimed Samson & Delilah a few years back. Throw in the ever-incredible Chris O’Dowd( The IT Crowd, Bridesmaids) and some toe tapping tunes from the likes of Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and more and you have yourself one hell of an enjoyable film. It’s in theatres next week so make sure you do yourself a favour and check it out!","Shortly after the film was the always fun after party at the Regent Theatre. Complete with celebrity guests and more free alcohol and canapés than you can poke a stick at, the party was one of the best that I have been to in recent years. After a few hours of wandering around, chatting to friends old and new and deciding from a distance whether to ask Matt Preston what he thought of the canapés, the night was capped off by a surprise performance from Jessica Mauboy who belted out some of the tunes from the film.","In short, if this is only the beginning of MIFF 2012 - it is going to be one hell of a ride.","Stay tuned throughout MIFF as I will be blogging all festival to give you an idea on what’s good, bad and inbetween.","Happy MIFFing kids."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"ASE Digital Workflows Event Summary","p":["5DtoRGB– handy tool for converting Canon DSLR footage whilst maintaining maximum quality","A lot of people also asked who we have used in the past for creating DCPs… we have personally built up a great working relationship with the Rodney at Jorr, and can’t recommend his companies services highly enough.

I remember I used to love “editing” music – try that too.","Here’s is my summary and response:","I don’t cut from knowledge… it’s not about knowledge – it’s about feeling…","I leave you with a fantastic YouTube clip (movie lovers may have seen already) edited by then 19 year old Matt Shapiro.","I think editors are a rare breed. Like most art-forms, you have to really, truly, ridiculously, LOVE what you do to be able to keep doing it. What’s really unique about editing as apposed to acting or directing, is that the pleasure comes from the process. Most people in America, Australia and the UK will not know who Michael Kahn is (no, not Michael Cain). Although, I would dare say that a hell of a lot know Indiana Jones, Jurrasic Park, Schindlers List, Hogans Heroes… hell even The Adventures of Tin Tin! Yes, Michael Kahn has a ridiculously expansive repertoire of films he has edited. But there’s no public prestige or fame for a film editor. Watching Michael’s interview really demonstrated the true humble spirit of a craftsman who loves his job.","It all comes back to passion. Michael Kahn is now 75 years old – and he’s still cutting.","It’s impossible to think about 10 years and 200 hours of archival footage when crafting a documentary – but it’s certainly possible to instinctively feel the rhythm and pace of a story, even when it’s unfolding as you work.","Lastly, a couple of EDITING TIPS from Michael Kahn:","LateNite Films is lucky enough to be situated in the heart of Australia’s upcoming acting scene – 16th Street Acting Studio. As part of our support and collaboration with this inspiring collective, we often work with them on their films. In the last week, I have had the pleasure and challenge of editing more than 22 scenes from various feature films which the students have been studying, Directed by Kim Farrent, who also directed the award-winning documentary, Naked on the Inside.","Never overlap a joke – let the actor finish their punch line!","No cold cuts!","Nothing gets in the way of the editing process, it’s the process of your thinking…","The beautiful thing about editing film, is you can only edit one scene at a time, one cut at a time… you see all the film up there, but it doesn’t matter, you deal with it one piece at a time…","The skill of being able to see the film as a whole, piece it together, but then somehow separate yourself from that notion and deal with scenes individually is magic. This method of thinking can be transferred to a lot of things outside of editing which improve productivity. But it’s more than that. It’s about giving yourself the mental space to improve quality. You’re completely centralised on the current fraction of a second, the current frame, whilst at the same time, feeling the rhythm of the story in it’s entirety. The ability to isolate, as apposed to overwhelm.","This interview really touched my heart, but what I love most about it, was his frank and honest introduction. He admitted to falling into the art of editing. It was something that seemed to organically evolve around him – not driven by his ambitions. So important.","This is a well known truth about the craft of editing. You can’t learn it in school, you can’t teach it to somebody else – it’s an intuitive thought process that is developed and improved through lots of work. Editing (and especially assistant editing) as a general rule, often involves huge demands and intense workloads. It can at times be quite overwhelming, especially if you’re just starting out, which makes me think that they way experienced editors handle what others would call “stress” is the true magic of a professional.","This statement is true. To be honest, hearing it made me a little emotional, thinking back to all the moments of pride, pain and pure excitement I’ve had over the years “making movies”.","Watching DP/30 Industry Legends: Editor Michael Kahn really connected me to what it means to be an Editor, whether it’s documentary or narrative. I highly recommend this precious and timeless interview to anyone in the film industry, especially editors and directors.","When two people work together, and they care about the film, there’s nothing you can’t overcome…","When you find a team you respect, and then that team finds a project you all care about, there is honestly nothing you can’t overcome. The perfect example right now is our wonderful friends in the UK at Realm Pictures, who overcame their initial financial issues with an epic crowd funding campaign, and are currently in production to make their dream come true to create The Underwater Realm– a series of short films set entirely underwater. They “ have always been about pushing the envelope - and this project is testing that attitude to breaking point”.","You can’t escape your film projects, even if things aren’t working, you don’t have choice but to keep working on an edit until it works. Michael Kahn had no problem asking Stevan Spielberg for help when he felt stuck. Working in film, every single project is different, so even when you have years of experience you will always find new challenged to overcome. And when you overcome them, you move onto the next. Michael Kahn doesn’t even watch the films he’s edited, and he doesn’t reflect. He simply approaches every film with fresh enthusiasm. He admits that although he began “not knowing what [he] was doing” , film editing has indeed “…become a passion”."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"5am-sri-lanka-in-may","l":"5am, Sri Lanka in May…","p":["A Miner’s Story.","All this may sound subjective, or even appear to be excessive and unnecessary work, but risking the quality and range of footage seems hardly worth the gamble. Alfred Hitchcock once said, “after pre-production the film is done; all that’s left to do is shoot it”. Okay, so, maybe Hitchcock didn’t make docos but he did make a few hit flicks believing that pre-poduction was everything in filmic story telling. And, being completely truthful, we were stretched pretty thin prior to Sri Lanka and went into the shooting with more a rough outline in a couple disjointed note books than a complete treatment – I was busy trying to sale or show my doco about plastic in the middle of the South Atlantic, and Jacqui was sailing in the middle of the same ocean shooting yet another environmentalism doco(or, as I prefer, a documentary about acting logically, or moreover, responsibly). Thus is the crux and passion of independent filmmaking trying to do too much and/or survive. Which is why you do what you can from lessons learned, and put forth such ungodly efforts as aforementioned. But, I digress to back to the why, when I should moving on to the how…","Although these moments come spontaneously, I believe it takes forethought as well. Jacqui and I planned all we could for this film, as one should, because more often than not a documentary will take the general shape of the treatment. Only, once the shooting is completed, and expectantly so, there are million fresh variables you could never have thought of until they occurred. This is what fills the gaps in summarised story, in outlined characters, in what your initial two-to-three page script could never have fit anyway. The changes to the detail are often the exciting segments of the film that define it and give the piece its overall resonance.","Cheers!","Coconuts juice – unfermented, I swear.","Connecting with the locals at Sri Sarananda Pirivena, Anuradhapura.","Despite the 30 years of civil war still shadowing, most of these people in remote impoverished villages showed so much kindness. The cyclist frequently stopped along the way to say hello, introducing themselves curious onlookers staring at their bright lycra and bamboo bikes, and try to explain why they were riding through their town. Before the explanation was made, we were often greeted with smiles and hands full of tropic Sri Lankan fruit – likely an exotic variety described in Singhalese or Tamil, which I cannot repeat and definitely could not spell! Varieties of coconut I never knew existed, what I think might of been smelly jack fruit, and, a little sour red blossoms you blew into to chase the feeding ants out before crunching a similar to the texture of a capsicum yet tart as a green apple. After each initial bite, came their careful peering followed by laughter or a smile depending on our face. I even received the nickname “Obama” from an overly friendly man with a squirt bottle was responsible for organising our stay at a monastery. This name either came about because of my inability to say “amma,” meaning mother, when trying to explain my background in Singhalese or simply because of my American heritage – and, the cyclist echoed my new endearment. Nearly everyone we encountered, was eager to share their uniquely Sri Lankan culture, showing a compassion to our strange-selves. That inspiring resolve is why I am so keen to share their story of transcending adversity.","Dinner, then came the food poisoning!","Documentaries are all about moments, about capturing a reality typically unseen, or creating a new perspective reality by juxtaposing a dream and situation that inspires a viewer. But how do you capture it? What is necessary to capture a feeling, a mood, or a dream? Just like life, there really is not a gift wrapped, all-inclusive answer, it is more subjective than we prefer. From my perspective, thinking far back from being a delusional student with a miniDV camcorder, and today, being far short of limos and red carpets, is that you have to push yourself far beyond what is comfortable or easy, in the direction of what may seem like an unachievable goal. And, when it comes to docos, the goals start with catching those moments that will grab ones attentions keep it with a childlike wonder.","Dondra Light House – a bit after 6am.","Floating… the other steady cam.","I HATE SNAKES!","It is nearly five in the morning and a mosquito possibly carrying malaria has joined me.

The reason you plan – even if it comes just before shooting, or scarier yet, while you have the camera rolling! – is that, an array of useful options are essential for the edit. These options are those bits in the middle of key beats of the treatment you could not fit in, nor could you have imagine them. Again, at the least as it pertains to whatever you think the film might be any point prior actually making it, you will absolutely need choice when it comes to post-production. To edit is to make decisions, shape the story. An edit is where you craft that ominous doco shooting ratio into something of interest, into a film that captivates. The edit is everything.","Peace!","So, when five in the am clicks round to some dance track on your filmmaking colleague’s iPhone alarm, try reminding yourself as you curse spitfire at the world – a curse debilitating that “feel good” techno artist that sings one verse really well with the assistance of auto-tuning – you have only a limited number those “magic hour” moments.","Some mornings, without the atmosphere’s guarantee, the sun moves steadily over the edge of the earth, and, for one brief hour or so, cast a soft bloom of gentle colour one could never quite reproduce, not even with a thousand thousand watt HMIs.

As glamorous as it may seem, a large amount of time was spent choking on rebuilt road construction dust in a rickety rickshaw, camera in hand as we chased the cyclist past every step of the way; following them along sacred temples, into beautiful waterfalls, through quaint villages, and past frequent AK47 brandished checkpoints throughout the north. Images certainly marked indelibly into memory. By going on this journey, in this way of bicycles, we were able to capture those segments outside of a guided trip, outside of our outline, and meet local faces wearing a history that gave us a glimpse into a world far from ours.","Without much prodding or prying, some conversations inevitably drifted to what tensions led to the long bloody political conflict. Prior to filming, passionate discussions were had about the ethics and responsibility we would follow when dealing with the topic that for so long plagued the peaceful in Sri Lanka. More so than aesthetics, more over the process of making a documentary, and maybe the most important thing to me was how to address this elephant in the room while keeping the main goal of the film clear, to inspire humanity. How does one give justice to this backstory that was the cause of so much of the hardships without finger pointing? Philosophers have noted, and history has shown, to ignore the past is to allow the future to repeat its mistakes. With that in mind, not wanting to whitewash the story, what we did while shooting was to remember our main goal, to keep the definition clear, keeping it always about the people rather than government. Meaning, tell the history and acknowledge the reasons in a personal way, leaving the larger controversy for a political film. Hopefully by focusing on the story of this young out-of-place white-collared, business suit wearing, cycling crew on an adventure interacting with all Sri Lankans, rich and poor, farmer to social worker, Tamil and Singhalese, it will be the catalyst that changes policies and protects the country as a whole. Knowing all this is very idealistic, in a world besieged by greed and selfishness, I belive a positive film showing the enchanting lifestyles, the silly customs, innocence of children, and a dream of peace can at least help us savour the light moments hope rather than let the dark press us down."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"A Day in the Life of Max Payne","p":["All good ‘Payne’ puns have been made.

For starters we decided to cover the boys in talcum powder to hopefully create a mist as they collide with each other – Mike expressed that he wanted as many particles flying off the boys at 300fps as possible. Secondly we decided to shoot the set up like an old spaghetti western, with each pair facing off like wild west gunslingers. What this set up does is create an anticipation of what these guys are about to do. We give the audience as little information as possible except planting the idea in their heads that each pair are going to face off with each other; how and why is not clear. This anticipation is what keeps our audience hooked right up until we have the band enter frame as they begin to run at each other.","For starters the clips were for two very different bands. The first for a Melbourne folk outfit called Huckleberry & Me and the second for grungy Melbourne rockers Money For Rope, who I’ve been a fan of for a long time.","It seems like an odd choice considering some of my favourite directors started in music videos. People like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Marc Webb, Mike Mills, Anton Corbijn and even David Fincher all made a blistering start to their careers by playing around and experimenting with their style through the predominantly visual medium that is music videos.","Peace.","Simple but effective.","The great thing about them is that you really have no boundaries. You can do whatever you want, however you want. That’s why I’ve never really understood performance clips – why shoot a band playing when you can screw around with style and tell a story, have a deeper meaning at the heart of the clip, or just plain and simple, shoot something balls out crazy.","The reason I’m talking about this and rambling on is because I’ve discovered a new love of shooting music videos. So far I have directed two clips (with fellow LateNite director Michael Shanks) and love them both for very different reasons.","The thing that becomes evident early on with music videos is there are so many factors which come into play, especially when it comes to money, as the music industry in Australia (by the looks of things) seems to be in no better shape than the film industry here with money being scarce. The great thing about this is it forces us to be creative with how we approach the clip and sometimes it can really come down to the absolute basics.","Up until this year LateNite has never really dabbled in music videos.","We shall release the Money For Rope clip hopefully soon but until such time here are a few of my personal favourites from over the years, the last of which is a recent clip by friend Kess Broekman-Dattner who took a really simple idea and turned it into a really beautiful clip.","We would love for you to post some of your own so feel free to comment and recommend some sweet ass music vids.","What was an insane and crazy idea has translated into something far more artistic than we originally anticipated. When shot in 300fps, the powder that we covered the guys in comes flying off and lingers in the air as the guys collide with each other, creating a floating path, tracking the guys movements. The impacts themselves look almost like a strange but sad dance as the six band members go flailing about in the air in slo mo. Again, a very simple idea that uses almost abstract imagery to tell a story.","What’s evident about music videos is that it doesn’t take just high production values for a clip to stick in your mind (I hate you Michael Bay). What matters is the story telling element and if a clip can reinforce the story of the song. Sometimes the simplest of ideas can be the strongest.","With the clip for Money For Rope we had a short amount of time and not a lot of cash, so we had to think of an idea that we thought would really do justice to their brilliant track, Misery Lane. The idea was simple from the boys: Have them run hell for leather at each other and shoot them colliding in slow motion, an idea that was originally meant for the cover art on their debut album.","You won’t be able to catch the clip for a few days whilst it’s in post and while the boys prep to release it but for the time being here is some sweet behind the scenes footage that the wonderful Jacqui Hocking shot whilst on set."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"2012-best-year-in-movies-since-sliced-bread","l":"2012.

A year which I’ve affectionately called the “Go F*#K yourself reality, I’m busy watching movies” year.","Before I get to the extreme orgasm that is the second half of the year. Let me do a very quick “look back” at the first 6 months of 2012.","BOOM.","Enjoy.","Firstly, Bond is the one character I have wanted to play all my life. Ever since my brilliant Uncle Michael introduced them to me many years ago when I was just a little lad. Skyfall is the 23rd film in the Bond franchise and is in Academy Award winning hands with one of my favourite directors, Sam Mendes, at the helm and more Academy Award winning and nominated actors than you can poke a stick at including Judi Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Albert Finney and BAFTA award winners/nominees in Ben Whishaw and Daniel Craig.","Here is a trailer to get you a little more excited.","I’d bang on more about him and his new film Django Unchained, but after seeing the trailer this morning - there be no banging needed.","I’d like to blame the fact that I’ve been extraordinarily busy with projects (which is no lie, I totally have) but really there is no excuse for not taking 10min to write a cute little blog post.","In the indie corner (which is normally my favourite) we were graced with The Descendants, The Artist, Martha Marcy May Marlene(proving that not all Olsen sisters deserve a well placed headbutt to the face), the surprisingly brilliant 50/50, Shame(I saw this at 10am and got an early morning eyeful of Michael Fassbender’s golf club like penis), the star studded Carnage and the simple yet beautiful Like Crazy starring my new female actress obsession in Felicity Jones.","It is totally better and I can definitely be greedy because (as one of my film lecturers once said) there is NO time for shit movies. And I agree. So let’s look at the second mind blowing 6 months of 2012.","Keep an eye out for my MIFF preview coming up in the next few weeks, otherwise - see ya soon kids.","My response to you dear sirs and ladies??","Now a trailer. Just to break up a touch of rambling.","Of course for every win we had some big losses. Most of which made me want to stab my eyes out with a ball point pen or watch reality television on loop (yup, that bad.) I’m talking about A Few Best Men, John Carter(formerly John Carter from Mars… unfortunately changing the name doesn’t make it any less shit), A Dangerous Method, Battleship(starring an ex-model and a pop star and based on a childhood board game - I wonder what went wrong) and the film that made me want to kill either Johnny Depp or Tim Burton, the depressingly bad Dark Shadows.","Ok so it’s been a while since I’ve written a blog entry.","On the big budget blockbuster side of things we were blessed with the likes of Guy Ritchie’s second Sherlock Holmes film, Fincher’s version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Scorsese’s Hugo, a childhood favourite in The Muppets, the popular Hunger Games and also the epic Avengers movie. All solid films to kick off 2012.","So there you have it.","The wonderful thing about this year (as opposed to the pile of shit that was 2011) is that we have been blessed with such a wonderful mix of, not only big Hollywood blockbusters, but equally impressive indie films and also an Australian gem or two.","There was also the wonderful Coriolanus which marked the directorial debut of legendary British actor Ralph Fiennes. It’s not often that modern day adaptations of old mate Will Shakespeare’s works are brilliantly done (see Macbeth starring Sam Worthington and a long haired Mick Molloy for my point to be very solidly backed up). But Ralph Fiennes in his directorial debut does a cracking job in translating the story to modern times.","This literally only covers July and August. And in amongst all of that wonderfulness is the Melbourne International Film Festival which runs from August 2nd – 19th. What is a man to do?? So many movies, so little time.","To begin with we have the American summer season which is normally littered with blockbusters. This year is no exception, with the release of (prepare yourself) The Amazing Spiderman(it’s got Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield in it so haters be damned), Seth Mcfarlane’s first foray into feature filmmaking in Ted(some of the animation was completed at Illoura in Melbourne – great work guys!!), a sweet looking Australian film called Not Suitable For Children(starring True Blood’s Ryan Kwanten - I’m hoping it’s just as good as the underrated Griff the Invisible which also starred Kwanten), the new Bourne film starring Jeremy Renner, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Moonrise Kingdom(instant erection material and Cannes opening night film), The Expendables 2(I have no choice but to see it as my dad looks like Schwarzenegger… also his name comes up on autocorrect which is all kinds of awesome), The Sapphires(another Australian gem that got a 15min standing ovation at Cannes) and of course, the mother of all blockbusters The Dark Knight Rises. It is literally the one trailer that I have seen in a cinema in recent years that has sound so loud the whole theatre shakes.","To quickly touch on some of the other gems (and so not to waste any more of your time) we also have the next chapter in Peter Jackson’s obsession with hairy midgets in The Hobbit: Part 1, a cute little indie starring Paul Dano called Ruby Sparks, animated heaven in Paranorman from the people that brought you Coraline, Gangster Squad(I’d list the amazing cast but there are far too many exciting names to list), Les Miserables(if you’re into that) and to finish off my rant and longest orgasm of my life the BRAND SPANKING NEW Bond and Tarantino films.","With June rounding out the first 6 months of the year we also have Prometheus(which I’m seeing at IMAX tonight so excuse the erection) and also Take This Waltz which looks like another sleeper hit and another big tick in the Michelle Williams box. Take that as you will."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Finding Global Perspective as a Filmmaker","p":["Last April I flew from Rio (where my TOPtoTOP footage will be shown at the Rio20+ World Earth Summit) - to Sao Paulo to meet, film & play with World X Cycle. It was an amazing weekend.","I flew back to Melbourne (with all my C02 emissions being offset by MyClimate) and finalised post for my short TOPtoTOP doco on Saint Helena Island, before I started preparing for the next major project in Sri Lanka. We just finished filming last week - here’s a sneak peak:","Documentary content is important. The process of making, creating & sharing doc is changing.","I used to struggle to explain the style & intention for my documentary content. The easiest way was to call it “Commercial”. Then, I heard Director Danny Boyle in the podcast of “ 127 hours - behind the scenes” say: “…CINEMA IS ABOUT MOMENTUM > emotion, continual change… that compelling momentum of film… that is why I’ve always believed that the purest of film, is actually, an action film…”","That’s it - capturing compelling moments which engage the audience & foster change > enrich perspective, inspire ambition, or simply encourage compassion towards causes, people or events being documented. Action is fun. It’s adventure. It’s inspiring to watch, and it stimulates our drive& energy to achieve our sense of purpose.","Plus it’s fun to edit.","It’s so exciting knowing I’m alongside so many amazing projects on the forefront of branded content & documentary creation, but being there means we have to be prepared to take the most risks. Creating independent, important branded content.","Personally, I want my films to be free & online.","I want to bridge the gap between creativity & commerce. I don’t believe in traditional advertising but am passionate about storytelling & artists collaborating within corporate organisations. I whole-heartedly believe that some of the most creative & adventurous people are the CEOs and business leaders. In my last 3 documentaries I have witnessed young, successful working professionals step outside their office & comfort zone to achieve the seemingly impossible. It’s inspiring.","I am moving to Singapore. I want to live in a multi-cultural society which doesn’t even see itself as multi-cultural, but has evolved naturally into a global community. Between the 7 people I travelled with recently to Sri Lanka, we collectively spoke 18 different languages.","Through my years of travelling, filming and meeting the worlds community - I’m finding our global perspective and sharing it– or perhaps even taking part in building it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"On The Borderline","p":["Here is an exciting video clip Directed, Edited and Performed by Michael Shanks, for his own band, Roadgeek.","Winner of Best Music Video(shared with David Michôd for his clip Loveless by Children Collide) and Best Independent Music Video at the 2012 St Kilda Film Festival – SoundKilda Competition.","Rage Indie Clip of the Week during September 2012.","Cinematography by the extremely talented Sam McCabe.","Special thanks to the Ryton Kids for letting Mike kill their dog!","You can listen to the band on The Triple J Unearthed website here.

However, for your viewing pleasure – for those that weren’t following our 48 Hour Twitter Feed– we made some notes as to which films we liked best from each screening, and thought we’d share them with you.

Just up the road is Taos Pueblo, a Native American Village and tribe, from which it takes it’s name. When we first discovered we would be heading over to New Mexico, we didn’t really know what to expect. Based on comments on Facebook, we knew it was snowing – but that’s about it.","Team","Team Team!","The Auctioneer","The Jigsaw","The Judges Criteria: 45% – Artistic Merit (e.g., Story, Creativity, Entertainment Value) 30% – Technical Merit 25% – Adherence to the Assignment","The Labyrinth","The Leg Breakers","The Magnificent","The Prince’s Perfect Party","The township of Taos itself is just jam-packed with shops and galleries selling all kinds of artwork, a few museums, beautiful restaurants and pubs, and well – that’s really about it. It’s a real artist community – with a real multicultural feel. The town itself is stunning – with some really unique architecture. The best way I can describe it, is that it looks like of like Egypt – most of the buildings have a sand-look and texture, with completely flat roofs – but with snow. At first I thought that everything had a Pueblo Revival style, but upon further investigation, it seems that the buildings in Taos are really made up of all different types of architectural styles. Surrounding the town is stunning snow-covered mountains.","The Vis It","There were a 100 films from all over the world attending at this years competition – and first up, I must say I am so impressed with all the hard work everyone put in. Last years films were pretty amazing – however, I feel like the bar has certainly been raised. There were more films with television level production quality, more films with complex crane and dolly movies, more films with powerful and emotional soundtracks, more films with crazy visual effects. We didn’t win anything – however that’s not really much of a surprise – as our film was completely an utterly mental, as I’m sure you’ll agree once you see it.","Top Less Productions","Trifecta / HeatStroke","True to Life","Type","Unfortunately that was the one and only Taos Shortz screening we could fit in – as the 48 Hour screenings clashed with everything else.","UPDATE March 2012: Also, here is a list of all the films that are fortunate enough to make it to NAB and Cannes! Congratulations everyone!","USA","Waesome Productions","We also wanted to thank EVERYONE who helped us with our own film, The Script Machine. We couldn’t have asked for a more talented and dedicated team of professionals. We will release the film very soon on our website – so stay tuned!","We wanted to take this opportunity to thank everyone who helped make Filmapalooza happen – especially Nicole Haddock, for ensuring all the technical elements of the screenings ran smoothly. Big thanks also to the Taos Shortz staff for making our stay so enjoyable.","We were fortunate enough to win best film in the 2010 Melbourne 48 Hour Film Project competition, and got to head over to Miami for the screening (you can read all about it here) – so it was such an honour and a privilege to be able to attend once again. We had a few technical hiccups in Miami, but I’m very pleased to say that this year everything went exceptionally smooth – and we had such a great time just hanging out with like-minded filmmakers from all over the world. Although we had a terrific time in Miami, I have to say, our experience in Taos far exceeded our expectations. It’s a beautiful town – and all of the filmmakers seemed a lot more relaxed and friendly this time round.","What a fantastic and exciting few days it’s been!

And guess what?? They are also quite lovely people whom you can talk to and work with rather than against to get the best for your film.","Christian Bale - The Fighter","Daniel Henshall / Lucas Pittaway - Snowtown","For starters, films are made by memorable performances. When people walked away from Avatar they were blown away by the visuals, but disappointed by the story and performances (well…except for Chris, but he’s a Jim Cameron fan-boy). A similar case can be made for the always criticised Michael Bay. Sure he shoots action better than most, but you always walk away from his movies unfulfilled cause all you can think about is how cringe worthy the actors were (apologies Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, but you really are just awful).","Great Story. Check.","Here is a bunch for me that really shook me to the core, made me laugh, made me cry or just plain fascinated me in the last little while:","I can totally understand why too as there is a minority of actors that gives us all a bad name. You know the ones I mean. They constantly name drop who they’ve worked with, what shows they’ve been on, that time that they were in that TV commercial for VB and were fourth in from the back next to the bar. Oh yeah and how they like to prepare on set by being “in character” the entire time the cameras arn’t rolling which means yelling abuse at crew, running off set and also throwing themselves into wardrobe vans because “their character” has ADD (true story).","I think we’re all smart enough to be able to know a good performance from a bad one so I urge you, next time you are casting your short or looking for actors, take that little bit longer to look past the one that was on home and away or was in a toothpaste commercial or perhaps was in a “feature film” that you’ve never heard of but IMDB said it’s real so you just assumed you missed it.","It is quite often that when watching a student short, or a low budget short or any type of film project made by an amateur filmmaker, that they forget one integral piece of the puzzle when it comes to telling their story.","Kristen Wiig - Bridesmaids","New directors are often scared by actors.","Now I’m not saying this happens all the time, and I’m not going to spend the next little while ranting but I’d just like to point out a few reasons (with some very good examples) as to why casting is so important when making a film. ESPECIALLY if you don’t have the money to really have all the bells and whistles of a multi-million dollar, government backed film. And guess what?? It’s bloody easy!","Our personal favourite, and number one recommendation though are our friends and sometimes collaborators at 16th Street Actors Studio.","Performances………whoops.","Ryan Gosling - Drive","Ryan Gosling / Michelle Williams - Blue Valentine","So long story short (kinda) I urge you, next time you are looking to cast your short or your low budget feature or your TV pilot, take that little bit longer and a bit more care in casting your project. Don’t just settle for credits, or because people are willing to work for nothing or “just have the right look” for what you want.","So where do you start to look???","Solid Production Values. Check.","Take the time to find the real actors. The ones that will give you truth and will give you their all and will fight for their character. Because that my friends, will be the difference between your film being Great or just kinda ok.","The work that goes on in that place is truly sublime and the teachers are some of the best in the business including people like Pamela Rabe, Kerry Armstrong, Noni Hazlehurst(just to name a few). They have a view on acting that works along a similar path as it does in the states which is that actors, regardless of who they are, never stop training. And it’s about finding the truth in the performance. Not playing for laughs or squeezing out a tear cause the script asks you too, but investing time in finding the truth of each character. It’s the very thing that makes some performances so damn affecting.","Then when push comes to shove these so called professionals get on set and are about as interesting to watch as a piece of dried toast.","There are plenty of wonderful institutions for actors in Melbourne including Melbourne Actors Lab, Tafta and The Rehearsal Room. You can even look online by signing up for an account with Showcast and potentially going through agents.","They have even managed to bring out some of THE WORLDS BEST acting coaches in recent years like Ivana Chubbuck( Halle Berry, Charlize Theron) and Larry Moss( Leonardo DiCaprio, Hilary Swank) to take master classes here in Melbourne. Their tireless efforts to get the best out of actors is nothing short of inspiring.","Think of films that have blown you away in recent times, and why you loved them. I can almost guarantee you that what you will remember is the performances - especially, if like me, you like walking away from a movie having been affected in some way shape or form.","Tilda Swinton - We Need To Talk About Kevin","Time and time again I see this problem with low budget filmmaking."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"2011-summary-part-two","l":"2011 Summary (Part Two)","p":["So just before Christmas you heard about the first 6 months which were very exciting at LateNite HQ, so who would have thought the next 6 were going to be even busier…"]},{"l":"July","p":["It was a slow movie month in Australia.

Steve Jobs was a visionary and sheer genius who pushed every boundary, and challenged every rule. His impact on the world will last for generations. Not only did he co-found Apple then keep it afloat when most thought it would sink, but he also rescued Pixar, and helped it become another of the most cutting-edge and inspirational companies in the world. He’s inspired millions – and will continue to do so for many years to come – us included.","We announced our partnership with Pocket Bonfire Productions in the launching of the Three One Six Oh film, music and arts festival to be held in 2012 in the Dandenong Ranges.","Apart from these major things, our favourite weekend of the year had also arrived, unfortunately though the 48 Hr Film Festival fell on Nick’s birthday. This didn’t seem to worry anyone too much though as the crew teamed up with LateNite newcomer Michael Shanks to attempt one of the harder 48 hr films in recent memory.","With numerous locations, over 20 actors, having to wrangle RED footage, horses, dance numbers, Muppets and more special effects then you can poke a stick at.

Chris & Eddie were once again on board to help make the clip happen alongside the incredibly talented of Director of Photography, James Ballard.","All of this craziness aside, there was one night which we looked forward to for the month of November and that was the screenings for the 48 Hour Film Project entries for 2011. Nick unfortunately had to miss the screenings due to being on stage however Chris, as usual, went to every single session.","He was blown away by the jump in standard from the year before and reported back that the entries this year were up there with some of the best 48 hr entries he had seen from the past few years.","It was announced that we had made it into the top 12 and come awards night we were all very nervous. Especially due to solid entries from our great friends and 48 hr competitors The Cameralla and No Man’s Field (formerly BetaMax).","What came was a huge surprise to all of us. And I don’t mean that in an arrogant “please, as if we weren’t gonna win” pretend bullshit kind of way. The whole LateNite team were literally gobsmacked. We knew our film was a really hard sell – I mean to be honest, it’s like being on an acid trip for 7 entire minutes. There were zombies and musical numbers and muppets and horses with lasers for eyes… See what I mean when I say acid trip??? So even the idea of coming close to winning ANYTHING was quite a distance from our minds.","We were fortunate enough to take home the awards for Best Script, Best Sound Design, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Director and the big one, Best Film. I said in my speech over the phone (I was running to the awards night after my play finished so Chris and Lee were good enough to call me) that I was very humbled by how well our film was received and the warmth that people showed towards such a bizarre piece of filmmaking. And I truly meant it.","I feel like our approach to filmmaking is very bold in the respect that even if we’re not sure if we can pull something off, we’ll give it a go anyway.","That’s one thing that I can say that I am truly proud of us for. The fact that even though sometimes it may seem like what we are attempting is insane and completely impossible, we are still prepared to give it a go. Sure there is always a possibility of failure… but if you don’t even attempt the impossible, how do you know if it was impossible in the first place?"]},{"l":"December","p":["An exciting new feature film written by Amanda Logan with the working title Splinter to be shot mid 2012.

Nick took charge of the art-show campaign with the very talented Thom Holt looking after the band night. Meanwhile, Chris was left to continue post production for our first feature film Hannah and the Hasbian.","The ever hard working Hocking actually took away all the Hannah footage that we shot over 3 days in December and began transcoding the RED footage whilst he was away on holidays! If that’s not commitment I don’t know what is.","The craziness of the new year swept all the way through January with press releases for Miami, Jacqui and Paula having a mad “tweet off” at the Virgin Mobile - Rolling Stone Awards and (possibly the biggest announcement of all) our very good friend Liam McIntyre working his little ass off to land the lead in the hugely popular Starz drama series Spartacus. The beautiful man currently has his face plastered all over Times Square.","The prep was in full swing too for our Feb March to Miami party with bands being booked, art being collected, venues being locked down and booze being sourced for a typical LateNite blow out - we really do go too far sometimes…"]},{"l":"February","p":["We did all but cut our own arm off to get this warehouse screening/party off the ground and boy did it go off like a frog in a sock. A big thank you must go out to all the bands that played, the talented artists that donated their amazing art work to be sold and of course all the people whose hard work made these two events what they were. It was very humbling to know that there are people out there who were willing to take a punt on us and who truly believe in what we’re doing. The venue was jam packed both nights, the bar was fully stocked with all kinds of wonderful drinks (although the home brew didn’t quite make it after a minor explosive accident), the slightly-too-big-for-the-venue PA was pumping with some incredible local bands, DJs and comedians – it truly was a EPIC and amazing weekend, with plenty of sore heads on Sunday morning!","Enough money was made to get Chris, myself and Thom to Miami for the screening so we were absolutely stoked and had so much fun putting it all together. Definitely one for the memory bank.","But of course not everything was fun and games with our very own Jacqui Hocking also working hard to orchestrate her own screening with the Australian Premiere of her very successful doco Spinning Dreams. A massive thank you to everyone at Open Channel for allowing us to use Shed4 for the screening. With over 200 attendees, and thousands of dollars raised for Timor Aid, we couldn’t be happier.","Jacqui had a very busy month as not only did she have her screening to organise, she went to East Timor to film footage for the World Vision 48 Hour Famine campaign, filmed at the Sustainable Living Festival, started working with the incredibly talented team at Inspire9, attended the Australian International Documentary Conference, was a guest at the Audi German Film Festival, helped out on the warehouse party AND had an exhibition set up at Federation Square during the weekend of the Tropfest screening in Melbourne. As with everything that Jacqui does, all went off incredibly successfully and the world had its first glimpse of the Spinning Dreams series.","But of course it’s not only our shenanigans that we like to keep track of and plug.

Unfortunately our screening (as well as the Sydney teams) was riddled with technical issues so needless to say we weren’t the happiest filmmakers in the cinema.","The boys spent their days at the movies and their nights networking. Met some inspirational filmmakers from all around the world including a Mexican indie filmmaker who made his film on 10,000 with only himself and his actor in the back of a truck. Amazing Stuff.","The winning film from the 48 Hr was SHIT HOT and starred the ever amazing Martin Freeman(trailer below).

Chris and Jacqui locked themselves away with Director Gordon Napier to really push out the film and make it the best it could be with the little money and time we had available to us.","We were lucky enough to have the support of The Butchery, the sleepless and unstoppable Eugene Richards at The Refinery, the incredible and beautiful Nidhi Chanani, Justin Viney, all our bands and of course the always amazing Craig Jansson at The Magic Sound Company – who personally went above and beyond what I ever thought was humanely possible.","April wasn’t all fun and games though as we were all very sad to hear of the passing of John Bowring ACS, the founder of LEMAC. John did a hell of a lot for the Australian film industry and his passing was a sad day for film in Australia."]},{"l":"May","p":["What better way to kick off our May summary than with a solid Australian film from 2011. Snowtown was as brutal as it was tense, obviously not a film for the light hearted, it was really made for me by the solid, often frightening performances of its lead actors Daniel Henshall and Lucas Pittaway.","Anyway it was another crazy busy month with lots of exciting announcements and more projects in the pipeline. Our first few announcements were that we were moving into our shiny new office at the much lauded 16th St Acting Studio, a place which has been our home ever since. And also that a film that we supported and were quite heavily involved with called There’s A Hippopotamus on the Roof Eating Cake by Jamie Snyder and Joel Sharpe was to screen at the very prestigious St Kilda Film Festival during May. Very exciting stuff.","Jacqui was busy preparing for the next month, whilst at the same time filming events such as the Mindful Conference.","We continued to push through with post on Hannah, spending more and more time with Craig and Eugene - trying to get the sound and grade locked down before the end of May.

We got great reviews and some very interested distributers to boot so we were all smiles.","By all accounts the Hannah team had the time of their lives and with the excitement and buzz behind the film, were all ready to send it off around the world.","Although, while Chris & Nick were busy with Hannah & The Hasbian– Jacqui was off to Cambodia with the amazing Michael Lutman for the second instalment of Spinning Dreams.","So that was the first 6 months – you’ll have to wait till after Christmas to hear about the second 6 before we launch into a New Year. But what the hey, we may as well give you a little treat while you wait over the next few days.","So here my friends is LateNite Films Music Video for Melbourne based band July Days…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Gosling Factor","p":["Some of you might be wondering why Ryan Gosling is worth an entire blog post. Or perhaps why a young man in his mid 20’s (and not a horny girl/woman between the ages of 15 - 40) is writing about Ryan Gosling at all.","The reason is this.","On reflection this year (arguably 2-3 years even) has been all about the Gosling Factor. His choice of script, director and in turn film has been impeccable with him being involved with some of my favourite films from the past few years. To add to that not only have they been great films in their own right, but a diversity of films from the star studded dramedy Crazy Stupid Love, to the disturbing but artistically beautiful Drive, to finally the taut political thriller The Ides of March.","All three of these films from the last 12 months have blown my mind and for very different reasons.","Crazy, Stupid, Love caught my attention from the word go with perhaps one of the best cut trailers for a romantic comedy. It had the perfect balance of drama and comedy, showing off the films loveable characters with a perfect blend of music (which included tracks from Goldfrapp and Muse) to compliment it. Check it out for yourself if you don’t believe me:","The film did much the same as the trailer, taking those moments of comedy gold and infusing them with what can only be described as heart. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that it was a film that was quite cliché however you tend to be able to look past the convenient plot devices due to the fact that all the performances in the film are so pitch perfect. Especially Gosling who steps out of his dramatic comfort zone to play a character type that isn’t really something that he has done before. In fact all the actors step out of their comfort zone with Steve Carrell playing essentially the straight man to Goslings funny man. If you haven’t already checked it out do yourself a favour, it’s a beautiful little film with great characters, lots of laughs and a killer soundtrack.","The next film I mentioned in the line up above is Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive.","Now Winding Refn is notorious for making quite dark, violent films. I first came across his work a number of years back at the Melbourne International Film Festival which played all three of Refn’s famous Danish gangland trilogy Pusher. These films really grabbed me by the nuts as they were raw and visceral but not unnecessarily violent, with Refn having a real talent for knowing when was and wasn’t appropriate to show extreme acts of violence on screen. I also love these movies due to the fact that he made the first Pusher film when he was only 24. Anyway the thing I loved so much about Drive is that it literally keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. Refn paces the film in such a way that the time waiting for something to happen is almost excruciating. It’s this sort of slow burn and Gosling’s under played performance of “The Driver” that make this film such a compelling watch. The cool, calm collectiveness of Gosling’s character make his extreme acts of violence even more shocking when they occur. However with that said I felt at the end of the film that I had watched something quite brutal but also quite beautiful. Everything he does in that film is for his love interest ( Carey Mulligan) and her little boy. It’s awful what he does but kind of beautiful at the same time. Hard to explain so I suggest you get it out and make up your own mind as it seems to be one of those films that people either love or hate with a passion.","The last in the trilogy of wins for the Gosling Factor is the George Clooney helmed Ides of March which is based on the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon.","The thing I liked about this movie is that I went in with a low expectation, as I’d heard that it was a little bit disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised to sit through what I thought was a very well written, acted and crafted political thriller. Gosling is once again on top form, overshadowing some a great ensemble cast of actors which includes Pail Giamatti, Phillip Seymor Hoffman and of course Clooney himself. If there was one criticism that I had it was that the movie seemed to take forever to get going. Once it got going it rocketed along at a cracking pace however it took just a wee bit too long to get to that point. Would much rather have spaced out the ending to make for a pacier beginning and a slightly slower ending of the film. All in all though a really solid effort from all involved and once again another solid Gosling movie.","So there you go. That’s my spiel about Gosling. As a man who (little known to most people) started out in the Mickey Mouse club with Britney Spears, it’s really wonderful to see Gosling flourishing. He is really starting to come into his own as an actor and has (and hopefully continues to) made really solid career choices along the way.","You’re amazing big guy – keep making solid choice and I’ll keep watching your movies.","Colla out."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"SPAA Conference 2011","p":["“Australia is the New China” according to Charlotte Mickie.","$358 million box office world wide","$40 million dollar budget","$7 million box office in China","1/3 Cast Must be Chinese","33 Post Cards","50% of the crew must be Chinese","Aaran Creece (NSW)","After a coffee, cookie and party pie – it was time to head to the first Breakout Session.","After giving us a summary of what she does, and what she’s all about she did give some words of wisdom:","After lunch, it was over to my most anticipated session – Sharing The Distribution Love. For those that have been following our Twitter feed for a while, you would have noticed that we are massive fans of The Tunnel Movie, so I was personally really excited to see what Enzo and Julian had to say about distribution. Moderated by Seph McKenna (the head of Australia Production at Roadshow Films), also on the panel was Bart Walker one of the founders of Cinetic Media in the US, and Daniel Dubiecki, one of the producers of Juno, and Thank You For Smoking. As usual, Screen Hub have done some great coverage of this session – so it’s well worth checking out. However, here are some notes:","After morning tea in the Digital Pictures Lounge Ballroom Lobby (on a side note the talented fokes at DP did all the amazing SPAA artwork and animations – great work!), it was off to another 360 breakout session – first up Your Underground Audience.","After morning tea, all the emerging producers had a up-close-and-personal presentation from the Screen Australia marketing team. Here are some highlights of some of the things that were discussed:","After that fantastic session I went to a round table discussion with Wynston Alberts from Google/YouTube. I basically just asked a whole lot of specific questions that about the Partnership program – so you can find out more about the YouTube Partnership program here. One of the big questions from the other people on the table was about the new 100 funded channels program that is happening in the US – so it’s worth reading this as well. And after a few casual drinks at the very expensive bar – it was another day wrapped!","After that it was up to the Grand Ballroom again for two Plenary talks – The Future is Digital & The Future is Now, and Politics, Policy & Profit: The 3 P’s of Convergence. Austin Bryan talked about the changing consumer habits and the explosion of digital devices and platforms, and how they have affected the way we all consume content. You can download the complete speech here.","After the lecture, and a few other house keeping talks, it was time for morning tea. Let me know just take the opportunity to say that the food throughout the whole conference was absolutely incredible. Lunches and morning tea at the Hilton, dinners at the various events and nibbles throughout the conference were all first class. The waiting staff at the Hilton were also fantastic, and always on the ball. Having worked on many high-profile conferences over the years in both Australia and overseas (as a lighting operator) – I can honestly say that this once of the best conferences I’ve been to in terms of food and hospitality.","Almost as quick as it all began – it was already the last day of the conference. First up in the Grand Ballroom, was the Plenary – Working Like a Dog to be King of the Castle. We were fortunate enough to have two of the biggest names in Australian producing at the conference, Emile Sherman(producer of The Kings Speech), and Nelson Woss(producer of Red Dog).","And almost as quickly as it began, it was time for the last breakout session of the conference – The Yellow Brick Road. Moderated by the inspiring and passionate Jennifer Wilson from The Project Factory– this was the perfect end to the conference.","And then… it was day one. First up, everyone from the conference (I would imagine there was about 2000 people), met in the Grand Ballroom at The Hilton, for the Plenary Speech from Geoff Brown (Executive Director of SPAA) and Brian Rosen (President of SPAA). Having never heard either of these people speak before, I have to say that I was quite impressed. Geoff Brown just oozes with intelligent and wit, however Brian’s talk was especially powerful, and right on the money (at least in my opinion) in terms of some of the issues that the industry faces, and possibly ways we could work around them. Next up was the Hector Crawford Memorial Lecture – which was basically a history lecture, much as you would experience in University – taken by industry veteran, and previous Australian of the Year, Nigel Dick. During a long and distinguished career Nigel has worked at the highest levels of the Australian television industry as a former chairman of HSV 7, Southern Cross Communications and chief executive of GTV 9, TCN 9 and the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand. Now, at the age of 83, he is writing a PhD thesis in the history department of Melbourne University. It just goes to show – once a hard worker, always a hard worker! The general gist of his talk was that history is basically repeating itself, and a lot of the mistakes from the past, can be used a lessons for the future. You can read the complete lecture on Screen Hub– which I highly recommend.","And with advice (along with a whole collection of funny stories) – it was off to the first official SPAA event – Welcome drinks at The Loft. There’s not really much I can say about this – apart from it was a really great start to the conference. Basically, all thirty emerging producers were thrown in a bar jam-packed with other much more experienced producers, and left to our own devices – to network, and make new contacts, but with the safety net of having thirty of “our own kind” to always go back to if conversations dry up. For me personally – I spent most of the night getting to know the emerging producers in the group, but also ran into a good friend who I worked with on my first ever properly paid gig, and haven’t seen for years, which was a very nice surprise – who also introduced me to some good people to know. It wasn’t a late night – which was good, as this was going to be a big few days anyway (and I also needed to tweak some things on our new website).","And with the last session of the conference complete, it was off to the Zeta Bar for some final networking, goodbye’s and a conference wrap. All the emerging producers had a group hug – which was a great way to end the conference.","Angelique Papadelias (NSW)","Animal Kingdom and Mary & Max made the most money in France.","Application process is extremely slow, and not transparent","As of March 2011, Tran has 273 videos available on her YouTube channel and is the most-subscribed user of all time in Australia, the 26th most subscribed of all time on YouTube, and the 7th-most subscribed director worldwide.

Set in a bizarre 1960’s inspired version of World War II, this action comedy series follows a team of five spies on a mission to kill Hitler. The concept will start as a 5 part web-series, and then continue on as a 6 part television show on SBS.","But first, to give you a rough idea of how the conference is organised, there are basically a few different elements:","By this time, I was getting hungry – so luckily it was time to eat!

It’s worth checking out their new Lean Back service – which looks great on a TV screen. Although he couldn’t release exact figures, it’s estimated that a million views = about $1000 in revenue.","Day Two opened with a really fantastic Plenary talk with Gareth Neame in the Grand Ballroom. Gareth is Managing Director of NBCUniversal’s TV production in the UK, expanding on his previous role as Managing Director of Carnival Films, the independent production company Neame sold to NBCUniversal in 2008. He now oversees all UK television production initiatives in Drama, Comedy and Entertainment. He is tasked with increasing NBCUniversal’s presence in the UK, building on the significant success of Carnival. Again, you can read all about the conversation on Screen Hub. One thing worth mentioning though, is that the BBC normally spends 12 days per episode for something like Spooks at around 3/4 million per episode – which seems like a lot compared to the shoot schedules in Australia!","Despite the fact that it was always planned as a commercial studio film – Red Dog has had a really great festival run","Docos with Universal Appeal","Don’t be naive!

For us, we had one lady from Film Victoria– who gave us some information and advice on the various functions and services they can provide. To be perfectly honest – I was a little disappointed. I would have loved to have more than one person from the funding body at the table, as there were six emerging producers from our state. Also, there are very little services and support for EMERGING producers when interacting with Film Victoria. All feature film funding requires an ESTABLISHED director or producer attached to the project – which is very annoying, for us, as we would much prefer to tackle the project ourselves, with the ASSISTANCE of Film Victoria. However, despite my person complaints about the way Film Victoria operates (especially compared to other State funding bodies) – lunch was great, and the woman on our table was very nice and supportive.","Emile aims to make 1-2 feature films a year with his company See-Saw-Films.","Emile is a big fan of the “French system” – where every dollar from your box office goes towards your next film.","Exceptional Drama","Familiarity is the most important thing for people like Natalie.

After approaching various people, and getting rejected, he decided to do it himself, with all his good friends from his hometown of Brisbane. When he released the first episode on YouTube, within one month the video got a million hits – so he knew he was on to something. But it wasn’t an instant success. You can’t just upload something and instantly receive a million hits. What he did was post his video around on other sites – such as animation sites, and spread the word that way.

I ended up staying at the Travellodge on Phillip Street, which was actually quite good. It’s wasn’t stupidly expensive, it was walking distance to the venue, the rooms were simple but nice – it’s quite, the shower is good and the best is comfortable. Flights were fairly expensive – but that’s to be expected.

After everyone introduced themselves, Melanie and John offered up 20 tips for a successful SPAA. I won’t list all of them here, but the general gist was:","The general outcome from the discussion was that doing an co-production with China is not easy, and there are a lot of cultural differences – HOWEVER, the benefits can be fantastic.","The next session I went to was It’s All Foreign to Me: Casting Across Borders. Although an extremely interesting, entertaining and intense session – rather than recreating the wheel, I recommend that you check out the summary on Screen Hub for all the details, as they have done a much better summary of the event than what I could have. The generally summary though is that producers are VERY unhappy with the MEAA, and the fact that no one from the MEAA wanted to come along to SPAA just threw more fuel on the fire.","The project began as a trailer for a non-existent film, produced as a student film at Flinders University by Dario for his final year Screen Production project.

Personally, “Gore Street” and “Like Me” (the two films that opened the awards night) were my favourites, and it’s such an honor to be up against such tough competition.","And now.. we need to start planning to head to New Mexico for the International Competition, which is very exciting!","And so, this year, we decided to throw everything we had at the comp! We called up everyone we normally work with, and told them that we were going to shoot something bold and almost impossible. We rounded up car rigs, underwater cameras, dolly’s, jib’s, smoke machines – everything we could get our hands on (even a Muppet). Instead of shooting on a Digital SLR, we decided to shoot on a RED ONE MX. Although you can’t write a script before the weekend of craziness – we did as much prep work as we possibly could. We went location scouting, and tried to find as many different options as possible, so that regardless of what genre we were given, or what the character was – we would have options. We even organised a old car, that we were planning to blow up (which unfortunately we never were able to – as we just didn’t have the time to do it safely).","And… in a few hours I need to head across to the opening night of the SPAA Conference. I was lucky enough to obtain a “Emerging Producers” grant to attend the festival, which is very exciting.","Best Regards, Chris!","For those that don’t know us – for the past three years we have entered into the 48 Hour Film Project competition in Melbourne.

Although we didn’t come close to winning the International Competition – we discovered just how good the competition was.","However – we made it, and although the film is absolutely insane – the judges must have been on our wavelength, as we picked up an unprecedented amount of awards – Best Script, Best Director, Best Sound Design, Best Editing and Best Overall Film. To be completely honest – we never expected this to happen. We knew we were doing something big, something to push all boundaries – but we never though the concept was good enough to push us across the line. You can throw as many tricks at a film – but without a good story, it’s nothing. Luckily for us – it seems the judges though our script wasn’t too shabby after all.","However, that’s not all that’s happening. As you would have noticed, we have just re-vamped our website. This is our first major overhaul since we set up the site many years ago – and we still have a lot to do on it, but by putting the blog and main site on the one easy to navigate place, we think you’ll find it a lot better.","Onwards & Upwards!","Post Production was equally insane – as we had massive 4K files to process, and a handful of visual effects shots that needed to be completed.","So, as usual – it’s all happening at LateNite HQ! Now that we have restructured the layout of the website, we will be in a much better position to post more detailed blogs and news – so definitely stay tuned for updates.","The incredible Mr. Thom Holt originally introduced us to the competition, wanting to team up to create what would become, Handle With Care. Thom’s team actually won the International Competition the year before, so although we didn’t quite match their track record, we were still fortunate enough to win Best Script and Best Character at the Melbourne awards. It was an amazingly fun weekend. Thom, Nick and the cast wrote up a script on the Friday night, then we shot it on Saturday and edited on Saturday night and Sunday morning. Although the pressure was intense (we were exporting in the car on the way to the Federation Square drop-off point!) – it was such an enjoyable experience, and we certainly learnt a lot from the whole process. We had a small crew, shot on a HVX, and just made the most of what we had. I’m incredibly proud of our little film – but we all knew we could create something even more magical if we put more prep work in.","The next year, we decided to step it up a notch, and enlisted a much bigger cast and crew of people we’ve worked with lots of times before. When we received the genre of thriller/suspense, Nick and Thom made a judgement call to shoot at my parents property in the Dandenong Ranges at night, because we could make it look dark and scary, and they would come up with a script on the one hour car ride there. Luckily for us, they came up with some really good ideas, and when they arrived at Olinda, they pitched their ideas to the cast, and let them start thinking about dialogue and blocking. Like the previous year, it was very much run and gun, and “make it up as you go along” – but this time we had a much bigger crew, and more gear to throw at problems. We shot all night Friday night, all day Saturday, and then started post production on Saturday night. This time we shot on a Canon 1D MK4 with beautiful Compact prime lenses. All the hard work certainly paid off, as we won Best Directing, Best Sound Design, Best Musical Score and Best Overall Film, which allowed us to head over to Miami for the International competition.","The shoot was epic to say the least. Multiple locations, lots of actors, a huge amount of complex setups, special effects make-up, underwater rigs, car mounts – even a horse (which as you can guess, decided it didn’t really want to be filmed, and got quite upset when we pointed a camera at his direction).","What an incredible weekend it’s been, and it’s only going to get more exciting as the days and months go on!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Swinburne Lecture August 2011","p":["Although not cheap – long term, it makes a lot of sense to archive to LTO as opposed to hard drives, so if you produce a lot of media, then it’s really worth the investment.","An blank LTO5 tape will cost you around AUD$115.00, which has a native data capacity of 1.5 TB. If you’re shooting a short film to RED, then you may be able to get all your R3D files onto the one LTO – which isn’t that much compared to a hard drive. So if you can hunt down a production house that has an LTO deck you can use for a few hours, then that might be a really viable option. LTO’s a great, because as they are tape based, you can store them on a shelf and not worry about having to check them every few months (like you have to do with a hard drive – which are designed to be “spun up” every now and again).","And of course, Canon DLSR’s have taken over film schools like the plague!","Anything worth backing up…","Archiving Dilemma","Are you ready for a crash?","As usual – which workflow and backup procedure you use will come down to your budget. At the very least though, you should have three backups of your raw media ($59 x 3 = $177), and two copies of your offline material ($59 x 2 = $118) plus at least a couple of SATA docking stations ($65) – so you can really get everything working for under $400, which is a pretty good deal. Obviously storing your camera originals to LTO would be a much SAFER option – but when you’re a student, you have to work with what you can afford.","Back in October last year, I was invited to speak to the 3rd and 4th year students at Swinburne University about Post Production Workflows (if you haven’t already, you can read about everything I discussed last time here). A couple of weeks ago I was invited back again to cover the same sort of thing with a whole new bunch of 3rd year students.","Backing up and later ARCHIVING your media is incredibly important – as I’m sure everyone can appreciate. I know at least a handful of filmmakers who have COMPLETELY lost their films, simply because they didn’t have their files adequately backed up. One poor girl had two copies of the media stored in two completely separate locations – but purely due to bad luck (a house fire at her Mum’s house and a electrical storm at her Dad’s house), even that wasn’t enough. Gone are the days of having a tape backup of everything (so at least you can re-capture all your media if a drive dies) – now days almost everything is stored digitally on really cheap hard drives.","Backing up the offline media to hard drives is really the only viable option. However, backing up project files from Final Cut Pro or Avid is a completely different story, as the files sizes are so small. As an added precaution, I would always keep multiple backups of your actual edit – just in case. How you do this is really up to you – maybe you can just store all your backups on a fairly large USB Stick (4 GB for $14.95 at MacFixIt– although sometimes you can buy even cheaper and bigger flash storage from places like Office Works), or you can backup your files to “the cloud” using services such as Dropbox, or any of the other cheap/free online storage services out there (of which there are many). Most universities offer some kind of storage on their servers as well – so that’s another good option for student filmmakers.","Backup Overview","Backup Tips – Prevent data loss with a good backup strategy","Below are some useful links to various sites around the Internet that are worth checking out on the topic of backing things up.

For example, in the professional world we normally have one or two LTO copies of all the camera originals for archiving purposes, and then also have it on three hard drives for easy access.","Hope this helps!

As with everything – make sure you do some workflow tests before you commit to a piece of software, as Grinder is constantly being updated and revised.","My Personal Backup Routine","My suggestion would be to store all your CAMERA & AUDIO ORIGINALS (i.e. the R3D files or ProRes 4444 files) on THREE separate drives, stored at THREE separate locations. In terms of a student film, I would give one drive to the editor, one to the director, and one to the producer (assuming they’re not all the same people). You might even be able to store a drive at your University, just for good measure – or maybe you just leave a drive at your grandparents house in a top cupboard for the duration of the post production process.","Not surprisingly, a fair bit has changed in the months between the lectures, so I thought it might be useful to document some of the new things I discussed on this blog.

There are many different tools out there that allow you to do this, but just make sure you use a tool (i.e. Apple’s Compressor) that RETAINS all the timecode and reel information. However, if you do accidentally use a tool that doesn’t bring the timecode and reel information across, you can always use QTChange again.","On this topic though – one very important thing to keep in mind BEFORE you purchase an enclosure is what kind of connection are you going to use? Given that you will be moving around very large chunks of data – the fastest connection you can get the better. If you’re lucky enough to have a new Apple laptop – then maybe a Thunderbolt drive is your best option. Thunderbolt I/O technology gives you two channels on the same connector with 10 Gbps of throughput in both directions meaning you can move data to and from peripherals up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and up to 12 times faster than with FireWire 800. The only downside is that as the technology is new, only a few products exist on the market currently, and their expensive. The next best option is eSATA. If you have a MacPro, then you’ll either need to purchase a eSATA card ($65 from MacFixIt), or you can get a cable that actually connects to the motherboard of the Mac ($25 from MacFixIt) – or if you’re on a 17″ MacBook Pro, you can buy a ExpressCard with eSATA connections ($29 from CPL or MacFixIt). If you can’t afford to upgrade to eSATA – then you’re best bet is FireWire 800. FireWire 400 and USB are generally a bit too slow for throwing around lots of data – but if that’s all you’ve got then that’s all you’ve got. Basically – just go with the fastest option you can afford, and remember you’re only as fast as the weakest link (for example if you’re copying from a USB card reader to a Thunderbolt drive – the bottleneck will be the USB card reader).","Once everything is named correctly, you can apply timecode to the clips. We use a program called QTChange(US$24.95) to add new timecode and a reel name to each clip. Although there are a few different ways to tackle timecode (i.e. you could just use Time of Day – based off the date information from the camera) – but we just normally set the hour mark, to the shoot day (i.e. day one begins at 01:00:00:00, day two begins at 02:00:00:00, etc.).","One question that lots of students had was, when you’re shooting with cameras such as the RED or ARRI Alexa that shoot such big files (and generally speaking people end up shooting a lot more footage with digital formats than if they were shooting with film – just because they can) – what’s the best way to store all this media when you’re a poor student filmmaker?","Onwards & Upwards!","Recently, Sony in the UK had a massive fire due to the recent riots, and their whole warehouse got burnt down, with thousands of DVD all going up in smoke (have a read of Chris Jones blog if you haven’t already). If you had your master stored at this facility – you’d be pretty worried right about now!","So how do you actually connect these drives to your computer? Luckily, there are heaps of different hard drive docking stations out there, so you have plenty of options – some that are really cheap, others that are built incredibly well, and cost a bit more money. For example, the product pictured above cost $29.00 from online reseller MacFixIt. There are plenty of options out there, including enclosures that have two bays (such as this one – $65 from CPL) – so it’s worth just doing a bit of Googling to see which enclosure is right for you.","So now you should have all your camera originals stored on three separate drives in three separate locations. But that’s really just the start. You now have to make media files which you’ll actually use for the offline process. If you’re shooting on RED, you might use REDCINE-X to transcode all the R3D files to ProRes or DNxHD – or if you’re shooting Alexa, you may just be working with the native ProRes files directly off the camera. I would recommend having two copies of all the offline material – one kept with the director and one with the editor (again, assuming they’re not the same person) – that way if you accidentally drop your drive the day before you need to export EDLs or OMFs – you can just jump straight back onto the backup drive. In a perfect world, it would be great to work off a RAID-protected (meaning, a Redundant Array of Independent or Inexpensive Disks) drive, as opposed to a standard drive for added protection. You can pick up two bay enclosures from as little as $149.00 from MacFixIt that allow you to run what’s called a RAID 1 – which basically mirrors the content from one drive to another. If you’re working with a huge amount of footage, then maybe a four-bay enclosure that supports RAID 5 (which means that if one of the four drives fails, then you can still re-build the information using the three other drives) would be a better option. If you want to learn more about how RAID protection works, there are plenty of resources out there on the Internet, such as this video.","The Canon is great for low-budget filmmakers and students, because the gear is cheap enough that you can actually own it, the cameras are small so that you can put them in all kinds of wonderful places that a RED or Alexa could never reach, the image quality is incredible (considering the price and the compression used), plus you can make use of all the incredible stills lenses out there. But of course, there are gotchas – the camera records to H264, it doesn’t record timecode, amongst many other things (i.e. when recording for long periods, especially in warmer climates, increased video noise may occur due to CMOS overheating – but let’s just focus on post for now). If you’re just planning to edit and FINISH in Final Cut Pro, then you don’t need to worry too much – just transcode all your footage to ProRes and way you go. However, if you plan to do an offline/online workflow – then you are going to need reel names and timecode. Although there are a few different ways you can do this, the method we recommend is as follows:","The other area that students wanted to learn more about what workflows for different digital formats.","The other little gotcha is that you may be files are recorded using the ALEXA Log C profile (for more information on what Log C actually is check out this post). This yields a low-contrast, “flat” image designed to preserve dynamic range and offer optimum grading latitude. It’s a wonderful alternative to true camera raw recording, but adds a few considerations for post. A lot of editors won’t want to work with the low-contrast image, and although you could just apply a 3-way colour corrector to everything in the timeline in FCP – this is probably not the most fluid way of working (especially if you’re on a lower spec Mac). However – this is what we do in Avid – we just apply a colour corrector to the whole sequence, so that everything in the sequence has a “look” applied. But a much better (although more time consuming) option, is to “bake” the look in, so you don’t have to worry about long render times, as you add more effects to your edit. The easiest way to do this is documented here. Keep in mind though, that Nick Shaw’s plugin is no longer free – so you can either purchase it (it’s only USD$30), purchase the much more expensive Glue Tools($799 – which is what we use at The Butchery, as it can handle ARRI RAW as well) or just use the 3-way Colour Corrector or a third party tool such as Colorista.","The RED One and EPIC have come along way in regards to post production workflows over the last few years. Although I personally never found the workflow too difficult, now-days you can basically just use the one application to transcode all your media for different NLEs. With the recent release of RCX-Pro, things are now even simpler, as the interface of REDCINE-X has basically just been “tweaked” to be much more user friendly and easy to manage. Basically, for Final Cut Pro, we recommend just converting everything to ProRes for the purposes of the offline edit. Later down the line, when you’re ready to grade – you can always go back to the original R3D files. Below is a really easy to follow video on how to convert all your RED rushes to ProRes using REDCINE-X:","To keep things as cheap as possible, my suggestion would be to just use bare drives (i.e. drives without an enclosure). You can pick up a Seagate 500 GB drive for as little as $42.00, or a 1 TB drive for $59.00 – which is pretty incredibly cheap if you think back to how much drives costed only a few years ago. You can buy these drives from any computer reseller, however if you’re near the city – then somewhere like Computer & Parts Land (CPL) in West Melbourne is a great option – as they’re cheap, open long hours and they normally have heaps of drives in stock. There are also plenty of online resellers that sell these kinds of drives really cheaply.","Unlike previous years, a lot of students this year are shooting on the ARRI Alexa(mainly because Swinburne now owns one). The Alexa is great, as the camera generates direct-to-edit ProRes media with embedded timecode and reel IDs, allowing you to basically instantly have access to the footage on Final Cut Pro or Avid (using AMA). These are self-contained files without a folder hierarchy to mess you up, like with P2 or XDCAM – you simply drag the ProRes files into the Final Cut Pro browser and away you go! In theory anyway. There are really only two things you need to keep in mind with the Alexa. If you shoot ProRes 4444, the file sizes are quite massive, and depending on your hard drive, what connection you’re using (i.e. Firewire 400, Firewire 800 or eSATA), and also how complex your edit is – you might find you get stuttered playback, or require a lot of renders. The solution – simply transcode all your footage to another variety of ProRes (i.e. ProRes LT or Proxy) and away you go! If you use Final Cut Pro or Compressor, the timecode and tape name will come across, so you’re good to go!","Use something like Name Mangler(US$10 on the App Store) to batch rename all your rushes to something a bit easier to keep track of (i.e. MVI_0021 becomes AD1R1S01 – A camera, day one, reel one, shot 1). This become really important if you’re shooting with multiple cameras over many days (i.e. documentaries), as you don’t really want duplicate file names, as it will just complicate things later down the line.","Useful Articles:"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Calculating Timecode in Excel","p":["=B1+B2","=framestoTC(B3,25)","=TCtoframes(A1,25)","=TCtoframes(A2,25)","And assuming everything was typed in correctly – you should now have your finished calculation!","And do the same for B2:","Download the XLA script from here(I hope you don’t mind Matthias, but I’ve also mirrored it here– just in case your site ever goes down).","feettoTC(feet,gauge,fps)","Finally, here is an nice and simple example Excel sheet you can download and test for yourself.

It has been a busy one for the whole team so we have unfortunately been snowed under with work. Also, for those of you have been long time followers of this blog, this is the first time Chris has let me (Nick) actually write something – so that’s exciting in itself!","All that aside I would like to welcome you to what will be our official MIFF blog for 2011. With our entry for the MIFF blogging competition being unfortunately rejected, and our film Hannah and the Hasbian being rejected then accepted then rejected again we thought we might just push on through with our very own blog.","So where better to kick things off then get some angry notes off my chest from what has been an average start to a festival that I hold very dear to my heart. I shall do this in dot point form so as not to bore you too much too soon as I’ve still got reviews to come!!","As a yearly MIFF goer I usually save up and get the passport so I can go generally nuts and see upwards of 50 - 60 films during the festival, with my personal best sitting at a hefty 64 films in one year. Unfortunately this year had to be scaled back due to me being unable to buy a pass due to not being a MIFF member……….which costs an extra 100 bucks………on top of the 350 for the passport……………..definitely affordable for your poor film & tv grad.","Opening Night - usually a wonderful evening of celebration where the whole film & tv community and some of the interested general public gather in the one location for a film and party to celebrate the opening of the festival. Unfortunately this year that usual one cinema venue (The Regent or Hamer Hall in previous years) was split over 5 cinemas at Russel Street’s uncomfortable Greater Union. The shit thing about this being that unless you were a VIP, you didn’t see the speech from the filmmakers or the Premier of Victoria, you instead waited for the one print of the film to get to your cinema which ended up causing a 30-45min delay. Also the party was split with VIP’s having a separate party upstairs which again is a really great way to promote segregation in our film community.","You can no longer buy just a film ticket to Opening and Closing night - JUST the film & party tickets.","Once spanned across the city at venues such as The Capital and The Regent Theatres, the festival now relies solely on GU, The Forum, ACMI and occasionally Kino as screening venues. GU taking the bulk of the films which is unfortunate considering it’s a really bad place to watch movies.","Festival crowds have seemed increasingly more abusive towards volunteer festival staff this year round.

Luckily I was pleasantly surprised with Belgian/French film The Fairy, a film that was also written and directed by its three lead actors. The film is a slapstick romance which revolves around a man working the night shift at a hotel who is visited by a woman claiming to be a Fairy. With strong links to the likes of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Jacques Tati’s work, the film itself feels like a series of sketches that have been worked around a really rough storyline. Unfortunately with this being the case, the longer the movie went, the more the audience became restless - possibly getting antsy to get to the Town Hall for their free booze and canapés. That said, I still thoroughly enjoyed The Fairy with it’s surreal “Boosh-like” moments which included a strange under-the-sea dance and also the very clever use of rear projection in a chase sequence.","One thing I loved about this film was the fact that the filmmakers all had a hand in the writing/directing and acting side of things. It was very clear that they played to their strengths as actors and physical comedians which was evident all throughout the film.","The Fairy is by no means a perfect film. It does drag on a little too long and has a few jokes that fall flat on their face. However this light hearted love story with its genuine laugh out loud moments made for a considerable boost in quality for the Opening Night films that I have seen during my 5 years of attending MIFF. I’ll take this over The Wedding Party or 2:37 any day!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Hollywood Complex","p":["What would be a more fitting way for a former child actor to officially start his festival than with a documentary about child actors trying to break through in the states. The Hollywood Complex follows a dozen or so child actors and their families who are staying at a complex called Oakwood during the 3-4 month pilot season in the states. To be honest I went to see this because I thought it would be a bit of a laugh, children and their pushy stage parents trying to find fame and fortune in Hollywood. I was right to some degree with these vibrant young children spouting off some dialogue that only a child could, however between these moments of sheer hilarity were moments that made my skin crawl. From one set of parents showing their 7 year old YouTube clips of sick and dying children to prepare her for her audition as a sick child on Grey’s Anatomy, to the mother who became a Scientologist to help improve her daughters chances of becoming famous (she got cast in something almost immediately after her mother joined), there were some really stomach churning moments.","I think the reason I really enjoyed this doco was because it showed Hollywood for what it is and didn’t shy away from the harsh realities of being an actor. It was obvious that the filmmakers set out with an agenda as the film has really nothing positive to say about the Hollywood system and the people that inhabit it. I’m sure there are exceptions to the rule and that we probably see some of the worst cases in this documentary; however it is a film that does deal with the dangers of setting out to achieve something for purely fame and fortune, and the pressure that it can put on people, especially children."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"so-close-no-matter-how-far","l":"So Close, No Matter How Far","p":["SO.

Since the last time I posted, fuck, I can’t even remember what that was. I probably should have looked before I started to write. I believe it was somewhere around the time we had submitted the script to Hopscotch and were waiting to hear back.","Since then, well, it’s been tough. Christmas and New Years hit and everything begins to slooooow down. Then the momentum gets lost. Then you feel the weight of expectations that you placed on yourself. You promised you’d have this done by then and that done by then, but because the momentum has gone, you become even more critical of yourself and of your creative process. I feel like a lazy mother fucker, so I sit in front of the blank Final Draft screen, watching the cursor click, just to placate my own ego. Then, of course, alt-tab to facebook to procrastinate.","It’s not to say I haven’t been doing work, but without the momentum, it all seems soooo much harder.

I will endeavor to you updated as regularly as I can. I have got a lot of ideas that I think can make it from a good script into a great script, but I have said that a billion times before now, so who knows if this time it’s actually true. The most important thing, I think, about the next draft, is that it’s going to be a heck of a lot more personal. My biggest problem thus far has been catering my rewrites to what other people want. Be that friends, colleagues, producers or even just some random person who happened to read the script. BULLSHIT! It has to, and can only ever come from me. I have to love the script and everything about it before anyone else can or will. I believe it was Joss Whedon who said “Write as you would if no one was watching”, and it is so true. The greatest writers, directors, actors, musicians, painters, poets and eBay sellers put their souls on display. Their very essence. Because otherwise, it’s just like everything and everyone else.

A massive thank you to Danette Wolpert, Carol Coombes and the rest of the festival team for making our stay so enjoyable! We have seen so many fantastic films over the last few weeks (as documented on this blog), and have met with so many talented film-makers and industry supporters. If you ever get a chance to come along to the festival – we HIGHLY recommend it. Miami is a great city, and we have made a lot of friends here, which is really what it’s all about. We even had the pleasure of talking at the Miami Dade College, about independent film-making in Australia which was a lot of fun. Thank you to Student Government President, Jennifer Sotolongo for organising the talk.","Unwanted","Valentown","Vietman","Washington, DC","We would also like to offer a massive congratulations to our friends, Tim, Joseph and the rest of the London team for their incredible film, “The Girl Is Mime”.

We highly recommend that you check out their behind the scenes video and photo gallery. I’m sure we’ll be seeing a lot more “Far From Home Films” in the future, after they showcase their film at Cannes later in the year. Make sure you support their film if you come across it!","We would also like to single out some great films that didn’t make the official top list – we were massive fans of the Albuquerque film “Camber Number 6”, the Granada entry Granagedon(which was hilarious!), the Miami film Palindrome, the Utrecht entry Onder Water and the Pittsburgh film Ali_N vs Predator.

Having already enjoyed public and critical acclaim, Elite Squad 2 is the current all-time largest box office ticket seller and highest-grossing film in Brazil, ahead of massive Hollywood blockbusters such as Avatar. This film was epic – it had massive action sequences, a soundtrack that shook the walls of the theatre, and even an opening title sequence that makes Michael Bay look like a wimp!","Admittedly, I’ve never seen the first movie in the series – however, director José Padilha explained prior to the screening that it was a movie designed to expose many of the hardships of life in Rio’s favelas in the late 90’s, where the streets were filled with violence and drug trafficking. This film however, set in the present day – takes a slightly different look at the same world, 13 years onwards.","The film opens in the Bangu 1 High-Security Penitentiary, where the inmates have basically taken over the whole jail, with a little help from a bunch of corrupt police and government officials who have turned a blind eye at all the right times. There are three gangs in the prison, and one gang leader is on a mission to kill off all his competition. BOPE– a government special forces unit of the Military Police is sent to take control of the situation, along with Human Right Aids member Diogo Fraga, who is charged with the task of making sure everything is done above board. However, things get really messy, when the BOPE team basically take out all the inmates. After Diogo Fraga tells the world what happened, Lieutenant-Colonel Roberto Nascimento and the second in command Captain André Matias are then accused of unethical execution of the prisoners. Matias is then transferred to the extremely corrupt Military Police, and Nascimento is kicked out of BOPE and forced to work in intelligence, alongside a corrupt Secretary of Security.","To complicate things on paper (although it’s very clear in the movie), Nascimento’s former wife is now going out with Fraga, and Nascimento’s son Rafael is having real issues with his biological father. Meanwhile, on the streets, Nascimento and the BOPE expel the drug dealers from several slums – however, with all the gangsters now out of business – a new enemy evolves. The militia, led by Major Rocha and supported by the Governor, the Secretary of Security and politicians interested in votes, have basically decided to offer citizen’s “security” in exchange for money. Everything is basically illegally taxed – and if you don’t pay up, you get killed. Nascimento is basically manipulated to help this group – vanquishing the criminals in the slums and poor communities, only to have a corrupt group of police officers now with free range to exploit the poor population.","This film is full on. It’s bold, powerful and ambitious – but what shocked me the most, is that when I was watching the film, I thought I was just watching a fictional big-time action movie. Apparently not! From what I’ve read and have since been told – this movie is incredibly realistic as to what it was like during this time, which is terrifying. There are so many deaths – so many people in the highest levels of government that are simply corrupt and just plain evil. But what scared me the most, is that in the theatre, whenever the “good guys” were put in a situation where they could actually kill off a “baddie” – the audience when crazy with cheering and clapping, regardless of how brutal the revenge was going to be. It’s a little scary to think that the only way to take on all the corruption and violence is to retaliate with the same actions.","I liked this film. It looked fantastic. It sounded AMAZING. It had more bangs, explosions and twists and turns than anything else I’ve seen at the festival thus far. I also loved the fact that the whole film was basically driven by a film noir style voice over. Although there were some really full-on action sequences, there was also some really powerful scenes that were just driven by dialogue. But what I liked most about this film, is that it inspired me to learn more about Brazil, and their troubled past. I honestly cannot believe that the BOPE logo was actually a skull and cross-bone – it seems completely inappropriate for a government organisation to be promoted like that! A seriously eye-opening film, that I highly recommend you check out!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Project Nim","p":["After seeing the movie poster and promotional stills for this film – who wouldn’t want to go and see it? Nim is just so darn cute! Project Nim was the name of a Columbia University experiment led by psychologist Herbert Terrace seeking to discover how much chimpanzees and humans could communicate through sign language.","This documentary tells you the story of what happened during this period in the 70s, where a bunch of young and inexperienced students and scientists tried to train and raise Nim as their own little child. Personal boundaries were blurred between teacher and student, human and animal. No one really had any idea what they were doing, and as a result, people got hurt – including poor Nim. This is a really simple documentary, that is basically just driven by interviews and tied together with whatever footage and stills they could lay their hands on. There was a lot of re-enactments, and a lot of stock footage of doors closing, and the like, just to fill in the gaps. Although director James Marsh(who also did the Oscar-winning film Man on Wire), did a great job of tying a story together with only a small amount of actual footage to play with – the whole movie, I just felt so sorry for little Nim! He was mistreated at every turn, and I just felt like a lot of heart-ache and injuries could have easily been avoided if some common sense was introduced. This is a really interesting film, with some seriously interesting characters – but it’s a simple documentary, with a very “BBC” feel to it. There was a lot of dull shots throughout the film, just to fill in the spaces left by the interview audio. It’s definitely worth watching – if only to see the adorable Nim cuddling an equally cute kitten."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold","p":["One thing that has really surprised me thus far at the festival is just how many fantastic documentaries have been on show! Boundary-pushing Oscar-nominated Morgan Spurlock is a true expert in his field. With profitable and Internationally successful films like Super Size Me and Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden? under his belt, I had quite high expectations for The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, but Morgan delivered. This is a hilarious, educational and seriously well crafted documentary that is based around such a simple, yet such a clever concept.","In Super Size Me, Morgan questioned how junk food affects our bodies – in this movie he investigates how modern advertising messes with our minds. Using the same style as his previous films – where Morgan basically takes you on a personal journey, where he talks to camera as if you’re in the room with him – in this film he takes the quest to the comic extreme by seeking corporate sponsors to entirely finance his movie – approaching major brands (such as Pom Wonderful and Hyatt hotels), and really obscure brands (such as Mane ‘n Tail Shampoo – a shampoo suitable for both humans and horses!). Why would any organisation in their rightful mind support this crazy venture? Because Morgan promises to promote their product as the greatest – drink, shoe, hotel, car, you name it – in the world, then he documents what they expect in return.","While using brands in film promotion is certainly not new for Hollywood (just look at films like I, Robot), it certainly is new territory for documentaries. Morgan exploits the phenomenon to new heights (possibly even to the absolute upper limit!), with everything from branded pizza boxes, in-flight film promotions to basically branding a whole primary school. He also explores the other extreme, where he visits a Brazilian city, where all advertising has been legally banned – there is not a single billboard or poster in the whole city!","This film is fantastic – the revelations throughout the film are both hilarious and horrific. He skilfully raises our awareness of how product placement works in entertainment, sports, and even school. He also shows just how far companies and advertising agencies go to craft a commercial that scientifically is proven to be effective with its’ viewers.","I love Morgan Spurlock. Although he certainly has his skeptics – he’s no doubt one of the kings of commercially viable, and internationally successful documentaries. This film was a joy to watch – and what was equally as good was the question and answer session after the movie. Morgan is such an intelligent and inspiring man – I cannot recommend his films or seeing him in person highly enough. Although his films are obviously a comedy – they also generate a huge amount of discussion and really highlight some very important issues in society. I love this man’s work – and can’t wait to see what he does with his next doco which is already in pre-production!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"A Quiet Life","p":["A Quiet Life is the story of an Italian expatriate Rosario who runs a quiet, yet successful roadside restaurant and hotel with the help of his beautiful younger business driven wife, Renate. Rosario is the head chef in his kitchen, and pushes the boundaries of what’s normally on the German menu by dishing out wild boar and crabs in the same sitting (something that’s obviously not the norm in Germany given the reaction from the rest of the staff in the kitchen!). They live a quiet life, where running the business, looking after their young son Mathais, and trying to kill a whole bunch of trees with copper nails (as the council won’t allow them to cut them down unless they are dying), are their only joys, priorities and challenges.","That is, until two young dangerous-looking Italian men, Diego and Edoardo turn up at the hotel looking for a place to stay. It soon becomes clear that Rosario hasn’t always lived such a quiet life after all – in fact many years ago, he ran from an Italian mob – leaving behind a wife and son, and a whole other life behind him. Although Diego and Edoardo’s main mission is to assassinate a German businessman who is trying to mess with some deal the gangsters have with a whole pile of waste departing from Naples – it soon becomes obvious that, unbeknownst to Edoardo, Diego has some side business to take up with the mysterious Rosario.","This is a good film – not a great film, certainly not a masterpiece, but just a plain and simple, good film. It looks good, has great acting, an fairly decent story line, and a fantastic sound-scape. However, the film seemed to lack real substance. Everything was explained, and everything flowed logically from point A to point B. Nothing was left up to the audience’s imagination. Everything was spelt out, just like in a children’s book. But don’t get me wrong – I still think it was a good film, and I would certainly recommend it to overs. The only reservation I have is that you just walk out the cinema going, “oh well, that was good” – there’s no discussion at the end of the film, no questions to answer. There was however some questionable camera moves – a few extravagant crane shots and dolly moves that seemed very unmotivated. They looked fantastic, but really stood out as being in there solely because they had the budget to do it – not because it helped the story, or added to anything. But that was the only real point of discussion after the film ended. Despite the film being intertwined with mystery and uncertainty – there was nothing left to discuss as the end credits rolled.","I was a massive fan of Diego and Edoardo, and thought that Edoardo’s brief love interest, Doris was an extremely sexy and beautiful woman who certainly added to the film. The film was like watching a couple of wild animals circling each other, snarling, and trying to work out who’s going to take the first move. Jam packed with lies, secrets and mysteries – this film tells the story of a big time gangster who leaves that world of danger, crime, and making sure you cover your footprints, but is forced to jump back into that survival mind-set when his families life is put at stake. Not an amazing film – but certainly a respectable effort for a 2nd feature film for the director."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"page-one-a-year-inside-the-new-york-times","l":"Page One: A Year Inside The New York Times","p":["Despite the occasional dodgy film, we have been so lucky to see so many quality films so far at the festival. Page One: A Year Inside The New Work Times, for me now however has definitely been a highlight. This is a serious slick, fun, enthralling and inspiring documentary that has been skilfully been put together with an incredible attention to detail.","As the title clearly suggests, this film offers a completely unprecedented look into the inscrutable New York Times newsroom for a year long period. With the Internet rapidly surpassing print as the world’s main source of news, and traditional newspapers and media outlets are going bankrupt left, right and centre, this film chronicles the media industry’s transformation from print to digital and also the industry’s reaction to game-changers such as the Apple iPad and WikiLeaks. The year was also full of dramatic changes, as internally the company struggled with massive cutbacks and lay-off’s, and outside of the office everyone debated it’s future within the public eye.","The film follows some amazing characters such as David Carr(an extremely intelligent and seriously witty columnist who overcame a crack addiction to become a world renowned reporter) and Brian Stelter(a young blogger come reporter who loves stirring up trouble) as they work behind the media desk, tracking the print industry and it slowly changes and evolves – which is ironic considering their own paper is seriously struggling to stay profitable and useful. Meanwhile, traditionally hardcore rigorous journalism -such as struggling and fighting for on-record quotes, animated debate and collaboration in between the office cubicles, and skilful pitching and negotiating for the page one spot – is all alive and well.","This film is fantastic – it really gives you such a unique insight into such an interesting and vibrant world that outsiders rarely get to see. Mixing sometimes hilarious, sometimes deadly serious interviews with fly-on-the-wall footage, archive footage and some very slick graphics – this film is very intelligently cut together. It’s the kind of film that you could watch for hours and hours – I would have been more than happy to sit in the theatre for another 60 minutes just to see what would come out of David Carr’s mouth. Probably my favourite part of the whole documentary was watching the debates between the traditional media outlets (such as The Times) and new media outlets, such as online aggregators and companies like Gawker(with their “Big Board”). This is certainly a relevant film – and is definitely worth checking out. I can’t wait for the sequel, as it’s going to be an extremely challenging and interesting few years for everyone at The Times as they struggle to get a viable pay-wall into place, and expand their business into new and exciting ways…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Freedom Riders","p":["Every now and again you come across a documentary that is slick, sophisticated, and really makes you think. Freedom Riders has got to be one of the most professional, and thought provoking films I have come across in recent years.","Almost one hundred years after United States President Abraham Lincoln issued Emancipation Proclamation, formally abolished slavery, and despite the increasing influential Civil Rights Movement, in the south of the country, racial segregation still ruled the land. As racial tension mounted, the current government in power – the Kennedy administration – were far too preoccupied with other matters, and remained indifferent on the subject.","However things changed on May 4th of 1961, when a group of 13 college-age students boarded a bus in Washington DC heading for New Orleans (near the bottom of the country). These Freedom Riders planned to challenge the segregation policies with a simple plan of attack – they would sit white and coloured people next to each other on the bus, have an African American rider sitting at the front of the bus (which was traditionally a “white only” area), and then at each stop, they would try and use the “whites only” toilets and shops. If faced with violence or abuse, they would just stand their ground, not retaliated, and just pray that they wouldn’t get hurt. Although the federal law specified that segregation at bus stations was not allowed – at a state level, these laws were still in place. Although the first wave of riders were fearless, and weren’t expecting a huge amount of issues (the worst situation they could foresee was jail for a few months), they were proven very wrong once they arrived in Alabama, where they were set upon by an organised mob, working alongside the local police (unofficially of course). After the first wave of Freedom Riders were so badly wounded that they decided to cancel the mission – a next bunch of youngsters jumped on the Greyhound and Trailways buses and continued the journey.","Despite the bashings, buses being set on fire, US officials being attacked, hundreds of people being put in jail for just sitting in “white only” or“coloured only” seat, and with no support from local police or government – in an incredibly important chapter of American history, and a vital part of the Civil Rights Movement, this film is an inspirational testament to the power of non-violence and sheer determination for human rights, in which a determined youth movement sucessfully changed the course of history. These people forced the federal government to jump in, and almost “trick” and force the local and state governments in the South to catch up with the rest of the country.","This film wasn’t preachy or self-righteous – it just laid out the facts and let the audience decide. It was incredibly unbiased, with interviews from the Freedom Riders themselves, but also included interviews from people from the left and right wing side of the government.","Personally, I feel like this is one of the best ways to make a documentary. The use of interviews, archival footage, dramatisations, and graphics was slick and faultless – and you were really glued to the screen for the full 113 minutes of run time.","This is obviously a very important part of American history – and it’s so good to see that the film-makers treated the topic with so much respect, research and hard work. This would have been a hard film to make – but they have really made a film that is both educational, and also forces the viewer to do their own research, and really get motivated to learn more about the era and the history, despite the fact that it’s gruesome and horrendous at times. I cannot recommend this film highly enough – another truly great documentary!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"In A Better World","p":["At the Academy Awards this year, the beautiful and incredibly intelligent Susanne Bier picked up the Best Foreign-Language Film award, so the expectations for this film were obviously fairly high when we walked into the cinema. After an insightful question and answer session, we were straight into this extraordinary and exceptional work of art.","In A Better World takes place in two locations – a drab and dangerous refugee camp in Sudan (but actually filmed in Kenya), and a grey and humdrum provincial town in Denmark. The lives of two Danish families cross each other, and an extraordinary, but risky and explosive friendship is born. However, frailty, loneliness, and sorrow are right around the corner! Almost as quickly as the friendship begins, it transforms into a dangerous alliance and so begins a breathtaking pursuit in which lives are at stake.","Young, intelligent, yet very unstable Christian moves back to Denmark with this grieving and incredibly withdrawn father, after the tragic loss of his mum to cancer. When he sees another boy, the braces wearing, nerdy-looking Elias being bullied in the school grounds of his new school, he decides to stand up against the much bigger kid, and show him who’s boss. Fuelled by the feeling that his father gave up on his dying mother, Christian makes the conscious decision to never give up, and to stand up for what he believes is right and wrong.","Elisa’s own father, Anton is having his own bullying problems. A doctor working on a humanitarian mission in a war-torn African nation – he is faced with a moral dilemma when he is given the option to operate on a gang-lord who is one of the reasons why there are so many patients at the make-shift hospital. To add to the frustration, weary of Anton’s frequent absences, Elias’s mother Marianne, has initiated divorce proceedings.","Drawn together through a shared feeling of betrayal and abandonment, Christian and Elias began striking out in an almost vigilante manner, against town bully’s in increasingly disturbing and violent ways.","This movie is incredibly powerful – and absolutely faultless (in my humble opinion). The characters within the film are so multifaceted, with so many different layers of emotion, and with such detailed and intricate back-stories – perfectly cast, with tremendous performances from each and every actor. Each of the characters are damaged in some way, and Susanne carefully reveals more and more floors as the film progresses. She explores many issues in this film, especially the fact that it’s in man’s very instinct to fight when threatened.","There is an incredible scene in which Anton is being bullied in front of Elias and Christian by a massive fiery auto-repair mechanic, in which he refuses to defend or avenge himself – explaining to the children that’s he’s just a coward bully, who’s only means of retaliation is to fight – however the kids don’t see it that way.","This is one of those films that makes you think to yourself – how would I react in this situation? How would I get out of this fight without throwing punches? How can you deal with other humans who ignore all logic and reasonable negotiation and simply rule with the power of their guns. How do you stand up against school yard bullies when you’re seriously out-numbered, and there are no teachers you can turn to? How do you deal with bullies without becoming a bully yourself?","This is one powerful film that doesn’t necessarily answer many questions – but more, inspires the audience to ask themselves – what would you do? Like films such as Crash – the story intertwines between characters and locations with ease, and not once do you feel confused as to where you are sitting within the story. It looks incredible – has an eerie, yet beautiful sound-scape, and honestly keeps you at the edge of your sit for the entire duration of the film. I can definitely see what this film has picked up so many awards – as it really is a powerful masterpiece that will stick in your mind for a very long time. Highly recommended!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Marimbas From Hell","p":["I am currently travelling with two other LateNite Films people at MIFF, and we all went and saw this film, titled Marimbas From Hell. One person thought it was a complete and utter waste of his time, another thought it was seriously funny – so hilarious that he kept on giggling like a school girl all the way to dinner (and no, it’s not hard to guess which member of our team I’m talking about). Personally, although I liked elements of the film – and yes, I did laugh at a few of the jokes – it was also one of those festival films where you just can’t wait for the closing credits. It was painful to watch, because it was slow, predictable, and just plain dull. It was also projected in the wrong aspect ratio – which never helps things!","When we walked into the theatre, we thought we were in for a funny, but real-life documentary. When the film opens with an interview with Don Alfonso in his very bare home – apart from his beloved marimbas (a variation of the xylophone) – and starts talking about how he lost all his personal belongings from being blackmailed, and is forced to hide away in fear that the criminals will come back and burn his beloved instrument (an instrument so intrinsic to Guatemalan musical culture, much the same as bagpipes are to the Scottish). But just the nature of the questions, the sometimes hilarious response from Don Alfonso, and the camera work in general, just oozzed “this has to be a mockumentary”. To be perfectly honest – I’m still not sure whether this movie is a true story or not – but I assume (and almost hope) that it’s not.","Don Alfonso eventually leaves his bare home, and in an effort to raise much needed funds, plays folkloric music in a fancy hotel in Guatemala City – unfortunately not one middle-aged tourist raises an eyelid – and due to the population’s lack of interest in his instrument, considered completely out-of-date and old fashioned – he is fired. Out on the streets, his former band mates fight him for the possession of his instrument, calling him selfish for “going solo”. Admittedly, this has to be one of the funniest scenes of the film – watching the childish fight take place with a locked off camera, as the marimbas is dragged from left of screen to right – with the weapon of choice being a rubber sandal.","Finally, in an effort to try and regenerate some real public interest in his beloved instrument, and also to dig himself out of his substantially big ditch- Don Alfonso, with the help of his slow and dim-witted godson Chiquilin (who was injured as a child) gets in touch with a pioneer of the Heavy Metal Guatemalan underground world – Blako (who also happens to be a doctor at the public hospital – but no one wants to be treated by him due to his long hair, tattoos and intimidating nature). Don Alfonso’s plan – to incorporate the marimbas in a heavy metal band, called Marimbas from Hell!","The rest of the movie is really all about trying to get the band off the ground. There are some really subtle, but funny moments, but there are also some scenes that drag out for so long, it will make you want to punch the audience member next to you. Although some people found these scenes so drawn out it was funny – I just found it frustrating.","The movie looked like a low-budget documentary – sounded like a low-budget documentary – and was acted like a first year university film. I feel really bad saying this, especially as the closing sub-title stated that “this is a tribute to the people I know who develop projects that are unthinkable in a country such as mine” – as I can imagine that making films in Guatemala is hardly a walk in the park.","You never found out why or how our hero was blackmailed, no do you really get an insight into any of the characters back story. This film almost feels as if it was made up on the spot, with the actors just improvising and coming up with funny scenes on the fly.","As I said – some of it was genuinely funny – but it’s also the kind of movie that just makes you cringe, as scenes are so awkward and drawn out. Personally, I wouldn’t really recommend seeing this film unless your a massive fan of this kind of awkward humour."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Armadillo","p":["At film festivals, there are always a few war documentaries thrown into the mix. Normally they are either very anti-war, or very pro-solider. One of the reasons I really loved this film is that it wasn’t forcefully pushing an opinion either way – although there were definitely moments where it showed war in a very negative and horrible light, at other times, it really showcased the role of a soldier is being a vital role in the fight against terrorism. Although the film-maker would have definitely have had a bias one way or the other, they definitely treated the subject with a huge amount of respect, and left the audience with a lot of questions that they need to answer on their own.","Named for a base in Afghanistan, Armadillo follows a troop of Danish soldiers serving as part of the international forces fighting against the Taliban. Covering a sixth month period, the film follows a group of young soldiers as they leave their families and girlfriends at home, and head to the war zone. They all start off as very immature and ignorant youngsters, but soon discover the harsh realities, sheer boredom, and pain of war, and are forced to “grow up” as they become a real team.","This documentary is extremely well crafted – and it’s obvious that the film-makers put their own lives on the line to make this film happen. There is no voice over – just observational footage, and interviews with the soldiers. It seems silly to even say it – but this documentary is extremely realistic (as yes, I know all documentaries should be realistic given their very nature) – the soldiers workout, they phone call their parents back home, watch porn, drink beer, and then they go out to be shot at and bombed. The conversations that they soldiers have with the locals are painful to watch – just regular Afghans caught between overseas invaders, and their own would-be tyrants, where they are constantly loosing their animals, their crops, and their lives. It’s horrible to see the army bombing homes simply because they can’t tell one Afghan farmer from a Afghan Taliban.","This film is extremely powerful, and very well put together. The poor editor would have had to work with hundreds of thousands of hours of footage, and they have done an amazing job. This is one slickly, powerfully cut together documentary. If you want to have an insight into the Afghanistan war, or even just to see what it’s really like for a solider in the Green Zone, then this is a must see film. It’s certainly not easy going – and there are some scenes that are incredibly hard to watch – but it’s real, and it’s a story that deserves to be told. I cannot recommend this amazing documentary highly enough…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Potiche","p":["Potiche(slang for “trophy wife”) is one of the funniest films that I have seen in a long time! From the opening Disney-like scene where the Madame Pujol is prancing around the woods in a tracksuit and hair curlers, listening to cheerful birds, and surrounded by friendly deer and a playful squirrel, only to come across two bunny’s going for it, I instantly knew that this was going to be a film on my wave length.","In classic battle of the sexes and classes, set in France in the 1970’s, the film centres on Madame Pujol’s family – her sexist and very traditionally husband, who runs Madame Pujol’s late father’s umbrella making company like a tyrant (the workers call him Hitler); her sexy and fiery daughter who is having relationship issues with her husband who is constantly travelling and never around to look after the kids and her nerdy and loveable son who wants to do something creative, rather than take over the family business.","When the workers at the umbrella factory go on strike, and the stress of the situation causes Madame Pujol’s husband to have a heart attack after he has been taking hostage by the workers – she is given the unpredictable and rare opportunity to take over the rains of her fathers business – and despite the fact that her husband just assumes she will just sit there and let the business runs herself, she actually turns the business completely around and gets the workers back on her side, increases profits, and employs her daughter and son who excel in their two very different fields of expertise.","Things get complicated when her husband returns home from hospital and wants his job back. A war between husband and wife begins, with brother and sister up against each other as well – and once the fists start flying, all kinds of family secrets surface, and it’s revealed that not everyone is as they seem, with lots of dirty secrets in the closets.","This film was hilariously funny, incredibly well-crafted, and definitely unpredictable. Although some of the jokes didn’t translate through the sub-titles, what was really great about this film was that one section of the audience laughed at one thing, and one section laughed at other things. The film looked fantastic, with some really great production design that perfectly showcased the style of the era.","Although when walking into the film, you could predict that Madame Pujol would walk out as a winner – you never stopped cheering for her for a second. Her strong will, determination and passion keep you with her for the entire journey, even when it’s revealed that she’s certainly not the perfect wife she looks like on paper. I loved this film – and highly recommend you go and check it out!

This movie can be best described as “video art” – it has really unique visual style, lots of great production design, a clever soundscape and some really great moments (one particular scene on the beach was very amusing), however the film as a whole felt like a whole heap of vague concepts thrown together just to see what happens.","Although there were some continuous themes and visual motifs throughout the whole film, and there was a rough beginning, middle and end with some clever set-ups and pay-offs, overall, personally I felt like this film was purely made so that the director wanted to experiment with his art – not entertain or challenge an audience. From that perspective, I was able to take away a few really interesting story and visual ideas that I can possibly incorporate into my own work – but this definitely isn’t a film I would recommended to the general public."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"chico--rita","l":"Chico & Rita","p":["Over the next few weeks I will be uploading as many brief reviews as I can manage, from films that I come across at the Miami International Film Festival. I’m going to be writing them on an iPad, and uploading them whenever I come across free Wi-Fi, so please excuse any poor grammar and spelling mistakes! I’m also going to take photos of all the tickets on my iPhone just for fun. If you agree or disagree with anything I write, please let me know via the comments! Also, if you’re at the festival this year, let us know!","This was the opening film at the Miami International Film Festival which showcased in quiet yet arty downtown Miami. A beautifully animated film, set in one of the greatest periods of creativity in Cuban-American jazz, is about the relationship between a talented and handsome, yet unstable piano player, Chico, and an equally incredible and enchanting singer, Rita, who’s not exactly sure what she wants in life – struggling with issues such as true love and fame.","The film looked amazing thanks to the fact that they filmed everything before animating it to ensure that all the camera moves and lighting looked authentic, and the sound design and score was incredible – with some seriously beautiful songs throughout the film. However personally, the story and script seemed to lack real heart and substance – that said the audience really seemed to connect with the film on a level that I seemed to miss. I think you not only needed to speak the language to get some of the jokes (some things were lost in the sub-titles it seems), but also to truly connect with the world of the film.","The story spanned several years, starting with Chico and Rita’s first meeting, then following along as their relationship develops, crashes, then reforms again. It’s a simple story (a potentially beautiful relationship constantly thrown into disarray due to unfortunate circumstances) with some really funny moments, and some really interesting characters, but I was never really able to relate to the main characters – and I felt like some of the minor characters were also very shallow. I felt for them at times, but never really went along with them for the whole ride. Overall, a good film – with a really great soundtrack (which sounded amazing in a big theatre), and it was definitely visually stunning, but not a story that I could really relate to on a deep personal level. However, I do think I saw it in the perfect environment, as the audience seemed to really go along for the ride, and get all the “in jokes” that went completely over my head. Definitely a great start to the festival!

In the end they sold it on to Fairlight in Japan, who set up a new company called Lightworks Inc in 1999. Gee Broadcast(who were initially set-up to provide a design and installation service for Broadcast Television Systems but expanded to equipment sales and distribution, including videographics and “engineering” products), then purchased Fairlight and the Lightworks technology in May 2004, and under new ownership, they released the Lightworks Touch range, the Alacrity range (an offline editing tool that incorporated the Lightworks job/shuttle console with analogue audio scrubbing, offered realtime effects with no rendering, SD and HD and was used to cut features like Evan Almighty), and the Softworks ranges (offering the Lightworks User Interface and toolset in a software only package for laptops or office workstations – keeping in mind at the time a Lightworks system was a complete package, not just sofware) for Standard Definition & High Definition editing.

Where to start? At the beginning. Yes. That seems suitable.","Lets back track a couple of days, Wednesday evening. My dad hands me a newspaper article about a deal being brokered between UPI (Universal Pictures International) and Hopscotch which will see UPI distribute more Australian films internationally (you can check out the article HERE). A very exciting prospect. He says to me “Get in touch with the guy interviewed [Troy Lum], sounds like SHOTGUN! would be right up their alley.” So, armed with my IMDb Pro account, I got his details. Fast forward a couple of days to Friday, about mid afternoon, I shoot him through an email. A pretty damn good pitch, if I do say so myself. That being said, I expected that I would be waiting a week at the least to hear back from him & that in all probability I would have to follow it up before I heard anything. WRONG! Within an hour he wrote back to me two simple lines “sounds interesting…. send me through a PDF script…”","Well, needless to say I was tickled that I had sparked his interest so quickly. But, having spent the better part of the last 5 weeks developing my ideas for a re-write and for the next draft, I was apprehensive about sending him the script in it’s current incarnation. So I wrote back to him “I’m just about finished a re-write, I’ll have it to you Monday morning.” And so the weekend began. Knowing that I had to work both Saturday & Sunday night in the Bio box for 8 hours each night, I immediately sat down and began pounding out the next draft. About 20 pages in, I realised that it was just not realistic to get this draft out in the small window of time I had. So, instead of re-writing the whole thing, I went back to draft 10.5 and began revising, re-writing and reshaping that with all the new ideas I had been working on.","Saturday day was spent writing. Saturday night working & writing. Sunday writing, Sunday night working & writing. I was up until 7.30am Monday morning (that being said, there was a 4 hour break from writing to hang out with Lee & watch Liverpool surrender a lead to Spurs… Fuck you Liverpool. Get Hodgson OUT NOW!) getting everything finished and looking peachy. I have to say, I’m pretty proud about what I’ve done, about some of the new developments in this draft. While it’s still a little bit off, it’s getting close enough to taste. We could shoot this script and make a kick-ass film. Fo Sho.","Had about 4 hours sleep, woke up & sent it off to Troy. One little problem I had was that the concept I pitched to him was the concept for Draft 11, working with an idea I had been developing for the Sam/May/Tony story line. This was not incorporated in draft 10.9, and thus I felt like I was back tracking a little bit in my email, like I had sold him a product under false pretense. It’s an idea that will be incorporated in draft 11 & will not make any whole sale changes, but it does spark the imagination a little more. Changing the concept from “what happens when three average joes get caught in the middle of an old gang rivalry” into “what happens when a hugely successful rock band gets caught in the middle of an old gang rivalry”. I felt a bit sheepish writing to him in the email that the concept I pitched to him was actually not the concept of the current draft. In fact, I felt like an absolute idiot. A moron. But I told him in all honesty. I sent him the development notes and gave him a little taste of something I have been organising – a comic-book cover series to accompany the website for each story line. I have to say, the proofs I’ve seen thus far are fucking amazing & I can’t wait to share them with you.","Monday evening. Nick & I had decided to go out for a romantic night out on the town & to have a chat. Nick & I had not been chatting that much in the previous weeks, and it had become apparent to both of us that something was wrong. To be honest with you, I was quite nervous about this meeting. I knew the direction it was gonna go & I know that neither Nick or myself like confrontation. After all, we are mates, more than mates, we are brothers from differing mothers. The last thing I wanted was for this to all end up in a shit fight.","So we met up & it is with great sadness that Nick & I came to the decision that he steps back from the producing side of SHOTGUN!. We spoke at length about the process, about his love of the project and belief in it, but that his passion and dedication lies in writing, directing & acting. At the end of the day, Nick is the same as me in that regard. I felt a great sense of honor when he said he wanted to produce my film, because I knew in his situation, I wouldn’t want to do the same. I would gladly & proudly help to get the film made, but to produce my first feature? No, it must be to direct & write, or act.","Nick & I had a great chat, cleared the air & he will now be taking charge of helping Nicole to deliver us a pretty awesome behind the scenes story, as well as helping me as a creative consultant. I have to say, it took a big man on Nick’s behalf to actually do what he has done. Many other people would’ve just stuck around for the ride, or kept going for fear of letting other people down. But in the end, all that does is tarnish the project in the long term.","We ate dumplings in some dumpling place in China Town, to a score of 90s love songs. We made up & then made out.

I didn’t even take the time to consider how exactly I wanted the script to be developed, I was too busy trying to accommodate those around me, close & far. And in the midst of all this, I thought I’d take a step back from my producing responsibilities and try to focus on the writing/directing side of things. Little did I realise that my chief responsibility as a producer had been to push the project along, be the heart & soul of the thing. Even having Chris point this out to me, I still thought it to be their responsibility to keep this train arolling. NO! NO FUCKING NO!","I grew my balls back.

Some times you need to put your personal relationships with people to one side, your sense of sentiment towards them for the benefit of the project. That’s not to say we’re not still all good mates & will continue to be so. But this is my baby, and I’ll be damned if it’s not gonna be the best damn film it can be.","In saying that, I’ve now been attempting to broaden my network of people to call upon for advice. Been putting myself in touch with people like Glendyn Ivin, Greg McLean & Anthony Hayes, people who have travelled the path, recently & not so recently, that we are embarking upon. I added them as friends on facebook & sent them a msg. The inevitable “what if they don’t accept, think I’m weird and then I ACTUALLY MEET THEM, jeez that’ll be awkward” thing comes up in my mind.

Some of the bigger offline editing companies have HDCAM decks – however, given the huge costs of these decks, a lot of the newer offline facilities have chosen to go with more file-based workflows.","All jobs shot on high-speed cameras, such as the Phantom and Photron are supplied to us on hard drive as images sequences (normally TIFFs or DPX’s). We then wrap these files in Quicktime Movies for ingestion into Final Cut Pro or Avid.","All jobs shot on the RED ONE are normally delivered on an external hard drive containing all the R3D files. We then use the free RedCineX software to convert the files to ProRes (for Final Cut Pro) or DNxHD (for Avid).","Almost every single job that has synced sound is recorded separately to the vision. That means that it needs to be synced manually using a slate. Sometime’s you’re lucky and they use a smart slate (which has timecode), so you can easily sync things quite quickly. Other times the clapper loader forgets to slate shots, or they use an iPhone app, which fails, etc. Although there are easy ways to sync cameras to audio recorders using timecode - in the real world, most of the time, they don’t do it.","As Swinburne students you are very lucky to get free access to Screen Hub. Make sure you make the most of this! Currently, there are lots of really interesting post production jobs out there, so it’s well worth having a look!","At the end of the day the assistant editors job is to ASSIST the editor. They must do whatever it takes to make the editors life fun, enjoyable and as easy as possible. The editors job is to edit a series of images into something that tells a story – you need to make sure the editor can do their job and are not distracted by anything else.","At the end of the offline edit process, we provide post production houses (such as Digital Pictures and Complete Post) EDLs so that they can work out which shots need to be scanned, graded and conformed. We basically use them as a tool to communicate with other posts houses systems to explain exact what frames of footage we are talking about (using timecode as our common “language”).","Avid 2 FCP","Avid Media Composer 5 Getting Started Training","Avid Resources:","Avid Screencast(lots of useful free Avid tutorials!)","Avid Tech Tips(a collection of very useful tips, tricks and workflows!)","Avid Tips","Basic Office Duties (photocopying, answering phones, printing, organising couriers, etc.)","Basically, anything you can to make the editors life easier!","Before I get into the specifics - I just want to give you a quick overview of what is involved on your average commercial. Generally speaking, the production company normally spends three days shooting the commercial - although this obviously depends on the complexity and nature of the spot. Some shoots go for 2 weeks for a 30sec spot; others only take a few hours to shoot. Once we receive rushes, the editor normally has about a week to start going through all the footage, making selects and putting together an assembly cut. Once they are in a good position, the director will come in and work with them. Normally the director and the editor have a couple of days to come up with something to present to the agency. The agency will then make suggestions, and everything will go back and forth until everyone is happy (or in some cases, until they run out of time!). The agency will then present the cuts to the client. If the client is happy, then that’s a job well done - if not, they will keep going back and forth until they are. Once the client approves the cut, the editors job is now over, and the assistant much prepare EDLs and OMFs for the online/grade and sound design. I will explain EDLs and OMFs in more detail shortly…","Best Regards, Chris!","Between the post producer and the assistant, all the scheduling details need to be worked out, such as when rushes will be received, and work out how long it will take to ingest and log all the footage, so that the editors knows when to come in.","But, if you’re not a fan of forums, here are some other great alternatives:","Canon 5D/7D Workflow Papers","Chris Jones Blog","Client Services (i.e. making coffees!)","Comparing the Log and Capture tools in Avid and Final Cut Pro","Conform EDL For each cut you do (i.e. 60sec, 90sec, 30sec), you will need to export an individual EDL for each track/layer. For example, if you have three different edits - you will need three different “sets” of EDLs. If each EDL has two layers/tracks, then you will end up with nine EDLs in total. The conform EDL should contain all effects, graphics, speed changes and transitions. Each EDL should start at the same timecode point as per the grade EDL (i.e. the first cut will start on 01:01:30:00, the second might start on 01:02:30:00, etc.). This EDL should be sorted by A-Mode (also referred to as “Master” in Final Cut Pro). This EDL will be used by the online artist to essentially “recreate” the edits as they appeared in the offline edit, however they will now link to the newly graded footage and any updated effects shots. Any speed effects and transitions will also be reapplied at full resolution.","Creative COW: Final Cut Pro discussion, articles and tutorials. http://forums.creativecow.net/index/","Data Management (backing up office computers, etc.)","DMN Final Cut Pro Channel has some really useful tutorials. http://finalcutpro.digitalmedianet.com/","Editing Standards","Everything you ever wanted to know about 24p and NTSC","FCP Daily","FCP Hot Tips Podcast: Every month, Apple certified trainer Martin Baker shows a hot tip for Final Cut Pro to save time and make your editing life easier. http://www.digital-heaven.co.uk/podcast/","Film Industry Bloggers","Final Cut Studio Planet: Tips and News Blog. http://dvcreators.net/finalcutstudioplanet/","Finalcutters","First off, there’s always Apple. http://www.apple.com/support/finalcutpro/","For anyone here who really wants to get into the world of postproduction, whether you want to work in visual effects, editing or post producing, one of the best ways to start out is an assistant editor. Although it’s an entry-level job - it’s certainly one of the most important roles in the postproduction process, and is a great stepping-stone to bigger and better things. That said, I know plenty of people who have made a whole career out of being an assistant editor, so it’s not necessarily a job that you have to grow out of.","For the next little while, I am going walk you through a typical commercial job from beginning to end. The reason I’m going to focus on commercials, as opposed to feature films, is that in reality, if you’re going to be an editor or assistant editor, most of your income is going to come from commercials. Feature films are great - and you really get to flex your creative muscles, however they take a year or more of your life, plus they don’t draw as much cash as a year’s worth of commercials would in comparison. The technology is basically all the same for both types of jobs - it’s really just the deadlines are longer for longer form projects, and instead of having agencies like you would in commercials, you have studios and investors to keep happy.","For those that don’t know, The Butchery is a boutique offline editorial company that mainly focuses their attention to commercials and film work.

After touring around Australia and the UK with the Tweenies, after I finished high school I started work in concert lighting and production management, based in Melbourne, but spending most of my time in Sydney with the occasional trips overseas and lots of trips around Australia. After two years of working essentially 24/7, I decided I needed a break from the crazy hours of live productions, and submitted my application for Swinburne Film & TV (little did I know at the time, that I would be working basically the same hours in Film & TV!). Like you guys (or at least like the people I originally designed this presentation for), I studied towards a Batchelor of Film & Television, and finished up in 2008 - still doing lots of freelance lighting and film jobs whilst studying. Last year, I got a job as the Assistant Editor at The Butchery, and this year after travelling overseas for the first half of the year; I’m now back at The Butchery as the Post Production Supervisor. What does that mean exactly? I am responsible for implementing effective workflows across the whole facility, training up new staff, maintaining the phones and servers, developing relationships with other post houses, testing new software and hardware, etc.","If we have a look at The Butchery website you can see that we mainly do some of the more creative, and higher-end commercials, such as some of the big beer ads, some of the big car companies, major softdrink companies such as Coke and Schweppes, government companies such as Worksafe, yummy companies like Cadbury, just to name a few. Jack has also cut two feature films, Last Ride and Bastardy- and Peter is currently working on a feature film called Hail. All of the editors also do short films and video clips whenever they can fit them in - and we’ve cut several award winning short films such as Cracker Bag, Nature’s Way and Jerrycan.","In addition to all the technical editing jobs, as an assistant editor you may also be expected to do:","In Final Cut Pro we create bins that following the syntax you see on the screen, and in Avid we create folders, which do exactly the same thing.","It’s also very important that you don’t just drag anything into Final Cut Pro.

Depending on the format, the rushes will arrive in a variety of different ways.","Once everything is into Final Cut Pro or Avid, all synced and sub-clipped. The editor can begin cutting. Whilst the editor is doing his or her thing, the assistant may be required to source sound effects and stock footage, do selects, create temporary visual effects, record temporary voice over’s, export DVDs and Quicktimes for Client Review, manage graphics, and even occasionally complete rough cuts of the edits to speed up the process for the editor.","Once the offline edit is complete, it is time to get everything ready for the online. The way we do this is export out an EDL (edit decision list). An EDL is a way of representing a film or video edit. It contains an ordered list of reel and timecode data representing where each video clip can be obtained in order to conform the final cut.","Once you’ve set up this structure it’s then just a matter of importing or capturing the footage, then syncing and sub-clipping as required.","One of the biggest issues with FCP is media management.

You need a rock solid folder structure. This is what I recommend.","One of the most important things to get your head around as an assistant editor is timecode. In theory, each frame of video on a project should have its own unique timecode reference. This is the one bit of metadata that allows you to easily track individual frames.

Well, if we start at the beginnings of a new job, the assistant will liaise with the post producer and the producer at the production company and make sure that everyone is on the same page. They will discuss formats and workflows. If the job is to be shot on film, they will normally get in touch with whoever is doing the telecine and the online, to make sure that everyone is on the same page. If the spot relies heavily on visual effects, then all the specifics need to be worked out now, so that there are no surprises later down the line. The assistant may also have to contact sound recordists and camera assistants just to double check settings. Basically - it’s the assistant’s job to make sure that when the editor eventually sits down in front of his computer, everything is in the right format, and everything just works. One of the most important documents at this stage is the specs sheet.

They will employ an agency to come up with a cool concept for an advertising campaign - for example, they might decide to do a commercial where there are a whole lot of skateboarders on fire. The agency will then hire a director they really like. Most commercial directors in Australia work for a particular production company, such as a directors collective like Exit Films, although there are some freelance directors out there that employ producers on a job-by-job basis. Production companies will normally pitch for the project, and the agency will decide which director/company is best suited for the project. Once the director is on board, he or she will then get in touch with their preferred editor for the project.

We probably could have avoided purchasing the USTREAM Producer Pro software, as in the end we only used a single video feed out of the MX70 and into the iMac – and we also probably could have used another solution other than USTREAM, such as Livestream, Justin.Tv or BlogStar– and avoided buying any 3rd party software. However, after much testing, we decided that the USTREAM platform was the most suitable, as the quality was great, it worked everytime, the advertising wasn’t too annoying, and after we played around with the Producer Pro software, we were all really impressed (even though we know it’s just a dumbed down and repackaged version of Wirecast Pro). Also, it was the only platform that we could get reliably working on the iPhone and iPad.","As we didn’t really have any substantial money for this event basically everything was begged, borrowed or stolen. At the end of the day, we did actually end up spending a lot more money than we hoped to – and in retrospect, we probably could have saved a lot of that money if we had more time or planned it a bit better – but that’s what happens when you’re under the pump – you are forced to just throw money to fix problems!","At the start of the show, we wanted to show off a video (that included a pre-recorded interview with Nick, Alistair and myself – plus a show reel, and the first section of the SHOTGUN! short film). We borrowed a small projector from 16th Street as the display method in the main room – and connected it up to a Analogue Way EasyFade. We had considered using a laptop and Quicktime movie for the intro video, but in the end decided that it would be more fail-safe to just use a DVD player. So we had two Professional Pioneer DVD players connected up to the EasyFade and audio mixer. Because the video footage needed to be displayed on the live stream as well, we connected the second composite output from the DVD player into a three way composite switcher, then into input four on the MX70. This meant that we could easily swap between camera 4, DVD 1 and DVD 2 on that input. It wasn’t ideal – but it worked fine! Lesson: always have a backup plan – we did, we had two DVD players that could be switched over with two button presses. Although this meant more cables, more monitors and more, well, just gear in general, it was the best option in terms of reliability. If we went with a computer solution, we would have to just hope that the computer wouldn’t crash (Mac’s never crash – right?), and also work out a reliable method of getting video off the computer and into the live stream. This could have been easily achieved with a scan converter and another VGA splitter, but we didn’t have one of those lying around unfortunately.","Best Regards, Chris!","Conclusion:","Deary me! What a week it has been! Things have been non-stop for me personally – and today is the first day for a long while where I’ve actually been able to just sit down for five minutes and ponder things. From all reports the live stream and script read in general was extremely successful, and we received a lot of really helpful feedback that will help shape SHOTGUN! into a better movie. So at the end of the day, despite all the hard work and hair pulling – it was certainly worth it in the end. But rather than tell you how perfectly everything went – which isn’t really helpful if you’re trying to do something like this yourselves – I thought I’d tell you about some of the issue we had putting together this event, and how we go around them – and also list some things for you to think about if you’re trying to do a similar event.","Everything else – all of the audio, video and streaming gear, the venue, and other bits and pieces were borrowed, donated or loaned. Frank at Madzin Productions supplied us with all of the audio gear, Jamie & Kim at 16th Street Acting Studios allowed us to take over their acting studio for use as a venue, and The Butchery also loaned us some technical bits and pieces. Finally, Jill & Dennis at Swinburne University were very kind to allow us to borrow three Sony V1Ps and tripods which we used for the live broadcast.","From a technical standpoint, the only tricky bit was joining everything together, as we didn’t really have all the bits to the puzzle – we had to make up a few things up as we went along!","I think we will definitely do more live streams in the future. They are a lot of fun – plus the audience at home really seemed to love the discussion! Although the chat room wasn’t going crazy – there were a lot of really positive comments, and we also generated quite a buzz on Facebook, which is always nice.","If you’re planning to do an event like this yourselves – to be perfectly honest, it’s not that hard. You can get away with just a laptop and a camera at the end of the day – hell all you really need is an iPhone 4 and the free USTREAM Broadcaster app! Things to remember: plan, plan, plan, if you use your brain and have time, you can save money at almost every turn, and finally, make sure you always have a backup in place!

This seemed to work fine. We used a mixture of Shure Beta 58s and 57s connected to a 24-channel stage box that went from under the tables of the read room, to backstage. We also had two PG81s as audience microphones also connected to the stage box. For FOH audio, we used two powered Mackie speakers – all running down the same stage box for easy cabling. Back stage, we used a Yamaha O1V96 for main control, and because we ran out of channels, we also used another Yamaha analogue desk as a submix. Channels 1 to 10 on the O1V were for cast microphones, 11+12 for audience microphones, 13+14 for iPod (walkin music), 15+16 for the submix. On the other desk we connected the two DVD players, a Voice Over microphone (just in case we needed to make announcements, etc.), another laptop audio feed (just in case the iPod failed or if we needed to play something else last minute). As explained previously, we also used this second desk for the camera comms. The digital out of the O1V went to the ADVC1000, the record out (stereo RCA connectors) of the O1V went to the Sony HDV deck, the stereo out (XLR) went to a dbx 1231 then directly into the two powered speakers, and looping out of the Sony HDV deck the stereo feed also went to a standalone audio hard drive recorder that Gab brought along with him (I’m not sure of the exact brand – but it was a great little unit – recorded 16-bit 48kHz Broadcast WAV files). As the O1V has all the effects and filters built in, that saved us a lot of hardware, but we also had 16 channels of dbx 266XL Compressor/Gate inserted over all the inputs of the 2nd audio desk, just in case! Hint: Compressors are your friend – especially for broadcast! Who knows when an actor might go crazy, and you’re just a little too slow on the faders!","Overall, a job well done! Bring on the next challenge!","Overall, despite a few minor issues, everything went fairly smoothly. The live stream was a success, and everyone who attended the event in person really seemed to love it. The “after party” was a big hit as well, as we had plenty of food and drinks to go around! Unfortunately Anli and myself missed out on this, as we had to pack up all the gear. Lesson: always plan for the bump out! In the end, Anli and myself packed everything up and drove it all back to the various suppliers, so we didn’t get home into the early hours of the morning – and even then, I had to get up an hour later to return the rest of the gear… One hour’s sleep isn’t ideal – but it’s better than nothing, and it was so worth it!","So we had four cameras that went into four 9-inch monitors, then looped out into the MX70. This was our main vision. Then out of the MX70 we went into a 24-inch preview monitor (connected via composite video) so that we could see what was going to screen, a Sony HDV deck (to record the whole event – also connected via composite video) and a Canopus ADVC1000 SDI to DV transcoder. The ADVC1000 was connected to an iMac (running Producer Pro). Audio was also being supplied to Producer Pro via the ADVC1000 – using the digital feed out of the Yamaha O1V(more on that in the audio section!).","The Audio Setup:","The stream itself seemed to work pretty well, all things considered. The biggest issue was, that because we only had half an hour to get everything up-and-running in the main room, we were all under the pump, and unfortunately made one big mistake at the start of the event. Originally, we had planned to start streaming from 6pm and start with the opening video. However, in the heat of the moment, we thought it would be a good idea to show people coming in… Bad idea! Only minutes later, we realised that as Nick was introducing the live audience to the event, we didn’t have a microphone on him, so everyone watching at home was getting visuals but no sound. Suddenly my mobile phone started going crazy – everyone thought there was a major problem with the audio. We should have stuck to our guns, and started streaming from where we all agreed we would start from – oh well! There was also a minor glitch at the start of the stream where the Internet grinded to a halt at the start, but we soon worked out that was because the stream really needed all of the bandwidth, and yet, we were trying to watch the stream on the same Internet connection just to make sure it was working. Once we turned off all the Internet connections on all the other machines and laptops lying around, everything worked great! To get around this minor issue, I ended up tethering my iPhone to my laptop over Bluetooth, just so that I could monitor the chat room and stream on a different Internet connection. Luckily, even though I was downloading the stream via my iPhone for the duration of the show, I still didn’t go over my Telstra cap! I got close (80%) – but no extra charge, thankfully! The only issue we had was that after a while for some reason, our stream no longer appeared on the USTREAM iPhone app. I have no idea why this was! It was working at the start, but it just all of a sudden disappeared. I have tried contacting USTREAM to ask about this, but no response as of yet. I guess their iPhone service just isn’t as stable as their desktop platform for whatever reason.","The Stream Itself:","The venue for the event was perfect – an old theatre that has been converted into acting studios. One of the room has theatre style seating (that sits about 40 people – although we squished in about 50), and at the rear of the room is what used to be the actual stage – but is now a green room. The best thing about this room is that it had big windows into the main theatre, so it essentially acted like a bio box. Very handy! The only problem with the venue was that we only had access to it at certain hours. So we could set up everything and test it on Saturday, but on Sunday they had classes running at the acting school, so we had to clear out the main room until the class finished. The issue? Our event started at 6, but the class didn’t finish until 5:30! So we only had hour an hour to set up the cameras, microphones, speakers, projector, get all the trestle tables in, etc. Luckily we could run and leave all the cables in the room on Saturday night, so at least we had all the infrastructure in place – we just had to plug everything back in and hoped it worked!","The Venue:","The Vision Setup:","We also ended up spending $150 on alcohol and $150 on food – in addition to getting some of the alcohol given to us in the form of sponsorship, which was very nice (thank you Paradigm Hill!). This was to be expected – as we really wanted to keep our guest fed and happy! In fact, considering we only spent $300 on food and drinks – we did really, really well. There was more than enough snacks, beer and wine to go round – so everyone was happy!","We didn’t end up bringing any lighting in, as we basically just didn’t have enough time to set it up. Luckily the venue had two Red Heads already in the room, which added a bit of fill lighting for the cameras.","We ended up spending $90 on a “ Spotlight Run” – just to buy some fabric for table cloths and other various things. Just like the water bottles, this was another case of time versus money. If we had more time, and actually planned for this properly – we could have borrowed some really nice table cloths, or raided my collection of film blacks. The lesson here is to always plan, plan, plan – especially the minor things (like table cloths!) – because if you don’t, it will cost you money, and all these little things quickly add up!","We ended up spending about $140 at a supermarket just on last minute things such as blank DVDs, MiniDV tapes, lollies and water for the cast, plus batteries. We only really needed two blank DVDs – so we didn’t really need to buy a big pack of 50 – but better to be safe than sorry. We probably could have gotten the MiniDV tapes cheaper, if we bought them in bulk for a money video-focussed store – but we just didn’t think about them till the last minute. We ended up just buying to slabs of water bottles from Safeway for the cast – but in retrospect, it would have been a lot cheaper to just borrow a whole lot of glasses and jugs, and just use tap water for the cast. Seems logical now – but when you’re trying to organise a billion other things, the option of just racing down to Safeway versus trying to track down a whole heap of glasses and jugs seems like the easiest option. It’s that old time versus money equation! At least now we have a whole heap of left over water, DVDs and MiniDV tapes for our next adventure!","We had three Sony V1Ps and one Sony Z1p to record the live event. We ended up recording on all four cameras to MiniDV tapes in 1080i mode. We also had a composite video line coming out of each camera into the MX70 (view a preview monitor), which was in the makeshift “bio-box” at the venue. Each camera had an operator, with three cameras pointing at the cast, and one camera used for reverses pointing at the audience. Unfortunately we couldn’t end up borrowing a proper comms system – so we had to make do with what we had. We ended up just having a headset microphone backstage for Jacqui (who was our vision mixer), connected to one of the audio mixers, then using of two of the AUX buses (and two XLR Y-splits), we ran individual lines to each camera’s XLRs microphones inputs. We then had headphones on each of the cameras for the camera operators to listen to the camera calls. That way the vision mixer could talk to the camera operators. In theory this should have worked fine – and it did when we tested the system the night before the actual event, but for some reason minutes before the show, the volume to each camera was horrible. We have no idea why this was – but something must have come loose somewhere prior to the show, or somehow a strange earth loop was introduced. To try and fix the problem, we removed the Y-splits, and replaced them with a headphone amplifier (i.e. one in many out), and just used the one AUX bus. This fixed the problem slightly – but not perfectly, but at the end of the day it was enough. The camera operators could hear Jacqui – even if the line was a bit noisy, so that was the main thing. Lesson here? Things will always go wrong last minute, so make sure you have some backup plans in place (in our case, it was lucky we had a headphone amplifier lying around!).","We spent $135.50 on printing expenses – which seems like a lot – but isn’t really considering how many feature film scripts we needed to print, plus information for all of the guests, flyers, door labels, etc. We all have printers at home, so it might have been cheaper to just do it ourselves (as opposed to handing it over to Officeworks to do for us). Next time, I’ll think we’ll definitely just fire up the laser printer for the scripts, and the photo printer for everything else…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The End of the Beginning","p":["This is a saying that I love to use (because it makes me sound smart, is apt & is a throw away to the expected), because in life, nothing ever really ends (aside from life itself & even then, it’s a new beginning), things only ever begin. The end of a day is really the beginning of the night, the end of the week is really the beginning of the weekend/the new week, the end of a job is really the start of the next adventure & so it goes.","For those who’ve been following our progress quite closely, you’ll know that last Sunday evening we held our first big event, launching SHOTGUN! out into the world – our live event SHOTGUN! [A Live Script Read]. Not only did we have a capacity audience in attendance, but we were fortunate enough to have many many viewers watching at home all around the world! From Melbourne, to Lyon, to Los Angeles – every person in attendance & watching at home can now have their part to play in the development of SHOTGUN!. And I have already been receiving some great ideas on how we can make this film even BETTER! So I want to put a big BIG thank you out to everyone who watched.","It was a night that I’ll never forget. From all of our careful planning paying off, to setting up the food & bev tables, to cast arriving… It’s always the small things that stick out. The electricity in our make-shift back-stage (a car park), as we passed the clap around the circle (no, not the STI… it’s a game, alright), did a bit of “What are you doing?”, through to “HA!” & finally the rallying speech from yours truly (not sure how I pulled that one off, but I did). Then, coming into our studio space, all the actors taking their seats, all the camera crew on stand-by… Everything ready to go! In comes the audience – 50 odd people packed into our studio space. Nick stands up & delivers his welcome speech & off we go!!! Everyone is on – lights, camera & most definitely action – actors going above & beyond to engage the audience in a dreaded line read, camera crew getting all the finer details of their performances & producers doing live video & audio mixes, while also engaging with our online audience in chat rooms and facebook forums. I cannot even begin to express my gratitude to all of those who went above & beyond, cast & crew, not for money (yeah, not ONE person was paid), but simply for the love of film-making, of story-telling & for the belief that together, we are going to make something really special. So thank you to each & everyone of you.","And then after, the networking, the drinks. The gratification of a job well done! And, for the most part, some great feedback on the night, the script & our direction as tenacious, passionate young filmmakers. I feel so much pride when I think about what we all achieved together, with limited time & budget – and get immensely excited when I think about what we’re going to do with AMPLE time & budget. Sunday truly marked the end of the beginning of the SHOTGUN! process. We’re here now, you’d better believe it. We’re here, & we’re gonna make some kick-ass mother fucking films!!","It’s been real folks, & it’s only about to get more…","AL.","PS. we’ve already had a few requests for DVDs of the live feed.

A rush of excitement, anxiety, relief, nervousness, confidence and gratitude washes through my veins & my blood. As I sit in the dark of my room, I prepare for our one & only rehearsal tomorrow, plotting various warm ups, some improvised exercises & of course, the read itself. But it is not the directing side of this shin-diggity-do that is likely to cause any sort of anxiety. No, that should be fine. Who couldn’t direct 16 actors, right?","The reality of my soul being on show to around about 40 people in the attendance and the millions watching at home on television (if ya smeeeeeeeeeeeeeell…. what the so-on & so forth is something) is starting to claw itself in and around my self-conscious.

Just download the “USTREAM Viewer” app & search for LateNite Films), that you are going to help me to make this the best damn film it can be!! Be constructive in your feedback & suggestion, but don’t censor yourself. If you think you’ve got a great idea after the read-through, fill out our little survey & tell me! I want to start a dialogue with whoever is out there paying attention – because that’s one fatal flaw in Australian filmmaking at the moment – these filmmakers are, for the most part, making films for themselves… Not for YOU, the people who pay the stupid money for the ticket (or the high-speed internet connection). So, if I can put my ego to one side…. Hold on.","“Ego..”“Why heeellllloooo, AL… And how are we feeling today?”“Yeah, about that.

Despite the fact that this whole “live stream” event has now blown completely out of proportion, I am so excited about the whole thing. I’ve spent the day driving around picking up gear, and have spent the last few hours testing it, and making sure it all works properly… The good news is, it does. And despite the fact we have a near non-existant budget for this event, we’ve managed to call upon a lot of favours, and are now able to really put on a show! The gear list has piled up dramatically, and I have no idea how I’m going to fit it all in my car now, but it’s still very exciting and very achievable! The best thing about doing stuff like this as well, is that it helps members of our team try new things – for example, Jacqui Hocking normally spends all her time shooting and cutting documentaries, but on Sunday night, she will pressing the buttons on the vision mixer. This will help her expand her skill-set into a whole other world – if, heaven forbid, the film industry dies, then at least she can jump on a console for live shows and TV! Although the technology is very similar, and most of the problems are the same (lack of money, lack of time, it’s always really hard to find good people) – there is still a completely different mentality between live events and filmmaking. I’m lucky – as I moved from the live world to film, so I’ve seen it from both sides. The best thing about this event is now I can drag all the LateNite team into my world!

We just need a venue, send out some invites, hook up some cameras, and some microphones, set up a streaming system, then you’ve got to think about catering, how you’re going to afford all this gear, how you’re going to pick up all this gear, now that you’re streaming it the venue has to look good on camera, what happens if the Internet fails… the list all of a sudden explodes into an achievable, but very large project!","That said, with only a few days until the event, things are looking very good. We have tested the streaming software (after various tests, we have decided to go with USTREAM as our hosting provider), and tonight I picked up all the audio gear, very kindly supplied by Frank from Madzin Productions. Tomorrow (meaning Friday!) we will pick up some cameras, video mixers, and a few other bits and piece to tie everything together.","From a technical standpoint, the event is quite simple – but there is a fair amount of gear. We have decided to mic every single actor – so that’s 18 lines of microphones in itself. We are using a Yamaha O1V96 as our primary audio console, plus another bunch of preamps that connect to the console via optical adat. We will have three Sony V1Ps(thank you Jill & Dennis!) connected to a Panasonic MX70(thank you Hugh!) as our primary vision mixer.

HQ. From our FB membership explosion, to trying to organize all the logistics of this LIVE SCRIPT READ (this coming Sunday October 17th…) & also hearing of murmurings coming in from international waters… SHOTGUN! is really starting to pick up some pace!","First off I’d like to congratulate our followers, our SHOTGUNIES for their help in helping us to get to a momentous day – the day we get to join the Facebook 444 club, as we reach & surpass 444 members. We’re all working tirelessly around the clock to get this thing rick-rolling & I personally want to thank all those ambassadors I’ve asked to help spread the word…. AND KEEP ON GOING!

Also that we received an email back from a very distinguished film editor in the UK, a note which I’d like to make a little bit more of, if you’ll humor me for a few moments of your life… Who are we kidding? If you don’t care for my babble, just go & invite all your FB friends to join our group, watch our live read & then be off with you!","Where were we? Oh right, the editor from the UK. So this guy is no slouch, that I can promise you. He has edited, most recently, 127 Hours & Kick-Ass, and most notably (in this writer’s humble opinion) Snatch & Layer Cake. Thanks to a little encouragement from one of our positive thinking & tenacious producers, Chris, I endeavored to get in contact with editors from films that I loved, to try & tie someone down to SHOTGUN!. Now, as you could imagine, when I sent an email to this guys agent, I never even thought for a second that I would hear a reply. If there’s one GREAT thing I learned from my time at 16th Street Actors Studio, it’s once you do something (in that case, an Audition, and in this case email someone you have a lot of respect for), you put it out of mind & just let it unfold as it will. Leave it in the lap of the Gods. Well, little more than 24 hours later, I received a reply from this gentleman, thanking me for my email & offering to help out however he could, given that he’s in the UK & offering to read the script… I have sub sequentially emailed a whole slew of people at the top of their game, including the likes of Peter Jackson, John Williams (the composer), Steven Spielberg, Guy Ritchie… The list goes one! And of course, when I say emailed them, I mean their agents. This little exercise has proved something that I always knew, but often struggled to put into practice – the power of putting yourself out there. In reality, I had absolutely nothing to lose, but then there was the idea of rejection… of not hearing back – or worse yet, being abused. But put this idea (which is actually just an issue of ego) to one side & you can conquer the world.

How do I start? What’s a good place to start? My answer is always invariably… at the beginning. Now that doesn’t have to be a conventional beginning. Your beginning could be someone else’s end. Your end, someone’s mid point. And so on & so forth until I have confused you so much, you forget what the question was.","Which brings me to the beginning of my blog. And it is with much excitement and enthusiasm that I chose this point as a good place to start. Draft 10 is in it’s final stages of completion. A script read is in the midst of being organised… The light at the end of the tunnel suddenly doesn’t seem so far off!","As you may well be aware, SHOTGUN! is a project I have been harnessing for 4 years now. It’s loosely based on, but more inspired by a short film my younger brother made called HardCase, which was a really simple, but fast moving “Lock, Stock & 2 Smokin’ Barrels” type short film. He was in year 12 in high school doing media studies when he made it & I was in my second year of my Bachelor of Film & TV.","“Woah…” I remember thinking as the credits rolled, as this project was head and shoulders above most things I’d seen at Film School. Technically & aesthetically it wasn’t brilliant, but the simplicity of the story (with a nice little twist) & the marriage of camera movement, sound & music was inspiring at the very least. So I endeavored to make a feature film with the same principles & some of my own.","I won’t bore you with the on goings of the past 4 years, from conception up until now (you can read about it a bit in my bio if you’d like), but lets say I feel well traveled & ready to go on this next stage of the film making process – Pre-Production!!","I couldn’t think of two guys who are better equipped to help me realise this project. The generosity with which Nick Colla & Chris Hocking have taken both me & my baby and nurtured it to be their own is astounding. I feel honored to be included as part of LateNite Films now & can’t wait for what the future holds for us!!","There are many exciting things coming up, the script read being one of them. Basically we’ve sat down & decided that we need to hear this bad boy read aloud. Not only that but with an audience. So we’ve been busy working our little bottoms off over the last 48 hours to lock down a read-through cast (thank God for the generosity of our peers, we’ve managed a fully professional ensemble), get a studio space (thank you 16th Street!!) and finally, get an audience!! Well, we haven’t so much done that last part yet… but we will! I can tell you from past experience, there is nothing quite like hearing your script read aloud. I’m not sure how it’s going to feel with an audience sitting behind me, but I can tell you I am so excited I have had a catheter installed to save money on underwear.","We’re also hope to kick off a behind the scenes story, we’re just trying to find the right person to undertake such a mammoth project (but fingers crossed we can find someone with enough balls & guile to make something really special).","Anyway, I think I’ve blabbered on & on enough for one post."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Inside Insanity","p":["Written by Guest Blogger on 23rd September 2010","Thank God for new technology, right?

Hand drawn and then brought into Photoshop, it was quick, simple, but incredibly effective. It was black and white – only because it was mainly going to be used for the closing credits of Happy Sundaes, and we wanted something simple. However, in retrospect, although the hand-drawn moon does represent us very well (i.e. we love to get down and dirty, and just make films with our own two hands!), the font choice wasn’t ideal and the lack of colour made it a tad boring.","In Pictures","Insurgency Films – Taken","Insurgent Films – Taken","It gives me great pleasure to announce that we officially have a new logo for LateNite Films (as we have also decided to write “LateNite Films” instead of “latenite films” as a tribute to Peter Jackson’s WingNet Films).","Kaboom – Taken","Kasplat – Taken","Landmark Films – Taken ( http://www.landmarkfilms.com/)","LateNite Films","Launch Pictures","Leading Edge Films- Taken","Matchbox Pictures","Onward & Upward!","Our next revision of the LateNite logo was put together by Isaac Egan (another LateNite founder, but has since moved on to other things), for the credits of Superb Menura (a documentary we shot whilst still at Swinburne).

It was the perfect fit for our documentary (as the whole film was about looking into someone else’s world), however as a company logo, it just never really fitted.

We tried doing it ourselves – but just never really came up with anything solid. After officially giving up, we decided to post something on Twitter. Within minutes, we suddenly started receiving emails, Facebook messages and Twitter DMs and Replies from all over the world. After looking through all the messages, we eventually came across a reply from an amazingly talented UK-based Graphic Designer René Ellis. She had a really solid range of work behind her – but more importantly, even though we only communicated via email and Twitter, I must say, she was an absolute joy to work with. She was fast, incredibly inspiring and creative, and made the whole process a lot of fun, as we tried out various styles and formatting until we came up with something we actually all agreed on. If you ever need a Graphic Designer for any project – I highly recommend getting in touch with her! You might as well add her on Twitter– just for future reference!","We needed something that was “us”. We’re a group of young independent filmmakers. We love movies. We love making films. We love to blow stuff up. We love pushing boundaries. We are fearless. We are regarded as “rebel” or “guerrilla filmmakers”, as we make stuff that has low budgets, utilises skeleton crews, shoot at whatever locations we can find and use simple props using whatever is available. We respect filmmakers like Spike Lee, Robert Rodriguez, Darren Aronofsky, Peter Jackson and George Lucas. Our attitude to filmmaking is tough, exciting and unique – our productions are slick, compelling and innovative, and we needed a logo to reflect this. We think our logo should look a little high-tech, have elements of war/military in it (to suit the rebel/guerrilla theme), and at the same time has a slight professional edge.","When we gave this pitch to René she addressed this straight away with a range of options. To be perfectly honest, all the logos she came up with were amazing. I would have been quite happy to use any of them for our logo. But in the end, we almost did a complete circle, and decided on a logo that was basically an extension of Eloise’s first creation – the hand drawn moon. Although René gave us options that perfectly matched our pitch (i.e. rebel but professional), in the end the hand drawn moon just felt the most LateNite.

Well… almost day one. In actual fact SHOTGUN! has been in development for many years already, however LateNite Films have only recently jumped on board, teaming up with Alistair Marks to help ensure that this amazing script gets off the page and into cinemas!","If we step back in time to 2007, writer/director/producer Alistair Marks(at the time in his final year of a Bachelor of Film & Television at Swinburne University), put together a very impressive short film titled “SHOTGUN! An Opening Sequence” with a team of enthusiastic and extremely talented students also studying at Swinburne, with the intention to raise enough interest from the short to get a full length feature film off the ground. Alistair wrote the script under mentor Richard Franklin, who sadly died before he got to see what his protegee had achieved. Franklin directed Hotel Sorrento, Psycho II and Patrick and worked with directors George Lucas and John Carpenter. When Alistair was interviewed by the Altona Laverton Mail, he reflected “Without him, I never would have had the guts to follow this through”, and that “he was so encouraging and believed in us and the project”.","Luckily for Alistair, Franklin wasn’t the only person who believed in his directing and scriptwriting abilities! With the help of casting director Sarah Hallam, Alistair and his team were able to secure an amazing cast including Samuel Johnson, Steve Bisley, Rachel Ward and Simon Lyndon.","After a fairly smooth principle photography and post production, especially considering the limited budget, the short was finally completed and was showcased to a collection of highly distinguished Australian film producers and investors at Camberwell’s Rivoli Cinema. From all reports, everyone loved the short, including audiences overseas as was proven by Alistair winning the Best International Director of a Short Film (2010 Los Angeles NYIIFF) and Best International Comedy Short Film (2009 New York International Independent Film Festival). But despite a huge amount of interest from various high profile people, at the time the short came out, the feature film script was not as solid as it could be, so instead of jumping straight into transforming the short film into a full length feature film, Alistair went back to the drawing board and rewrote the script many times to get it to it’s current 8th draft.","Step forward to the present… Now, at long last, from all reports and advice from some of the best in the business (including Stuart Beattie of Tomorrow When The War Began fame) – the script is finally ready to be made!

Then before there’s even time to react, as an audience we’re plunged into a very nasty situation, but certainly not a simple one. This film is amazing – it’s simple in terms of production values, only has a very small cast of three characters, and only a handfull of locations, but seriously keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, as has so many completely unpredictable twists and spins. It looks great (I presume it was shot on 35mm), sounds great – but it’s the cast and the killer script that makes it such an incredible film.","It’s also incredibly inspiring for young up-and-coming filmmakers like ourselves. It really highlights the fact that you don’t need a million dollars to make a really good film. You just need a great idea, an amazing script and an incredible cast.

I am travelling with my girl friend Karen, who’s keeping a blog of our journey at Melbourne To Moshi, if you’re interested in seeing any photos!","I was so lucky that I ended up in hospital with such a good team behind me. In all seriousness, if I wasn’t travelling with such amazing people, then even such a simple thing as taking some dodgy medication that doesn’t agree with you, could have caused me fatal problems (to put it lightly!). Having a good team, a good family, behind you in vital.","I’ve always known that team-work and community was important, in both film-making and life in general. Hell – it seems like common sense. However, it’s not until now that I really UNDERSTAND that importance.","Ok… so this blog entry is really going a bit all over the place, so apologies if you’re completely confused as to what exactly I’m trying to say. I guess my point is the same as it always is. Film-making is all about working as a team to achieve a common goal. It’s about pushing boundaries. It’s about trying new things. It’s about failing, but then getting up and trying again. It’s about enthusiasm and excitement. It’s about the thrill of the chase! But it’s all very well to just say this – it’s another thing to truly believe it.","One of the biggest problems I found at film school was that the majority of the students weren’t motivated. They wanted to make movies, but didn’t want to join the film-making community. They wanted to get their ideas on the big screen – but they didn’t have the passion to really push boundaries. Which brings me to my final point (I promise).","Onwards, Upwards and always spinning, spinning, spinning…!","Originally I had planned to take these four months “properly off” – meaning no mobile phone, no e-mail, no contact. That lasted for a little while – but as Karen was keeping a blog updated, she had a computer with her, so it wasn’t long before I was checking my e-mails again. Luckily, Jacqui and Nick are getting all of my important business e-mails – so I haven’t had to do any real work whilst I’ve been away – just the occasional fun thing – like writing this blog!","Over the last few weeks I’ve been reading droidMAKER– the story of George Lucas, and the digital film revolution. If you need motivation – read this book! It’s INCREDIBLE! Almost every single person featured in the book is inspiring. Each talented individual was presented with a seemingly impossible (or at the very least, extremely challenging!) task – but instead of just giving up, they push boundaries, invented new things, and just “made it work”.","So anyway, the reason I’m writing this blog is because something motivated me recently. I actually ended up in hospital in Vietnam. Nothing too serious! Like a lot of travellers, I ate something dodgy and got your typical food poisoning. After a few days of “bad things coming out of both ends”, I took some medication to help stop me spewing up. It worked for a couple of days, but then after one meal when I thought I had finally recovered, I got an allergic reaction to what I presumed was the food – but was actually the drugs. My body started freaking out, my throat started closing up, my tongue grew bigger, and I had serious trouble breathing. I hate hospital. No, seriously, I really hate hospitals. Nothing scares me more than needles. But, given that I couldn’t breathe, I had to be rushed to the doc by a very scared, but very calm and wonderful girlfriend, and an amazing Intrepid tour guide (which was handy as he spoke the local language – something Karen and myself haven’t mastered yet!). Luckily, after a scary few hours, the incredible doctors and nurses at the hospital fixed me up, and after two days, I was good to go on my way. Now… why am I telling you all this personal stuff? Because… and I hate saying this because it’s so cliche… but life is short! You never know what’s around the corner, so you really need to make the most of it. You need to make the most of every single opportunity. You need to push boundaries. You need to try new things – but not get scared when things go wrong. In life you just need to keep “bashing at it” – and film-making is exactly the same.","So don’t despair – the latenite camp is not sleeping. Things are happening. Things are busy.","So in summary. I highly recommend working your butt off for a while, then go travel. Go somewhere far away. Go somewhere new and exciting. I highly recommend Cambodia! Leave your phone. Set up an e-mail auto reply. Escape. Relax. Enjoy. But also don’t be scared to jump straight back on the bandwagon when you need to. Because, at the end of the day, as much as I needed a holiday, doing stuff like writing this blog isn’t just a job. It’s a way of life. I enjoy what I do. In fact I love it. It’s not just a job. It’s not just a passion. It’s a way of life. Film-making, technology and the PEOPLE behind both is the reason I get up in the morning with a smile. It’s the fuel that keeps me going right through the night.","The end of 2009 was crazy busy on both personal and business levels for everyone. After wrapping “Handle With Care” (our very successful 24-hour film festival entry – for those that don’t know, we picked up the “Best Script” and “Best use of Character” awards), we began proper post production on “One Flu North” – a Tropfest Entry Script written and directed by Nick Colla. Although we shot One Flu North earlier in the year, “real life” got in the way of things (as usual), and we kept on putting off the editing stages of the short. But, as always happens, time crept away, and before we knew it, December was upon us, and time was running out for the January Tropfest deadline! So after a crazy period of editing around the clock for several days, then suffering a massive hard drive crash (hint: always have several backups of everything in several different locations! I know, I know – you already know this – but come on!) and having to re-do all the visual effects, rendering and conversions (from 30P to 25P!), we eventually got there in the end. Despite the obstacles, the short film turned out exceptionally well – even though it didn’t make it into Tropfest this time round. We will be submitting it into several festivals over the coming months, so stay tuned! The end of 2009 was also busy for our friends at Pocketbonfire, who are still deep in post production for “There’s a Hippopotamus on our Roof Eating Cake” – which we have been assisting with.","The lead up to the holiday was insane, because not only did I have to plan for over four months away (which was a challenge in itself), but I also had to train up a new staff member at The Butchery(a leading editing post production facility that I was working at full time last year – “i.e. my day job” which allowed me to devote so much time to no-budget latenite films projects!), and tie up heaps of loose ends so that both The Butchery and latenite films could run smoothly without me (you’ll be pleased to hear that both companies are running exceptionally smoothly – thanks Andrew, Jacqui & Nick!).","Travel. I have never believed it before now. Everyone always says travelling, and exploring the world is one of the most important and brain-expanding things you can do. I never thought it was true. I always thought I was “worldly” because I’d been to several different countries, and experienced “local” things. But the more travelling I do, the more my mind is becoming active. It’s seems cliche (again!), but travelling helps makes everything clearer (and I’m only in the few stages of my holiday adventure!). It gives you time to relax, and rejuvenate. It gives you time to consolidate all the ideas you have in your head.","Well… despite my absence… lots! Nick Colla and Jacqui Hocking are seriously full steam ahead on several exciting projects – including “Shotgun”, a feature film concept that’s been floating around outside of latenite for years now. Nick also has some serious acting jobs in the pipeline, as well as his radio show. Jacqui is about to head overseas, and has been knee deep in post production on several projects. Her new blog should be up again shortly, so stay tuned for that.","Well… that’s all from me today. I’ll be in Vietnam for the next couple of weeks, and then I’ll be heading off to beautiful Laos. The adventure continues! However, while I’m away, make sure you keep an eye on the latenite site, as things are certainly going full steam ahead in my absence!","When you learn about the Vietnam War, and how the Viet Cong defeated the American Soldiers with the assistance of complex tunnel systems, and deadly & horrific (but also scarily ingenious) bamboo traps – you realise that power and brute strength isn’t everything. Sometimes you need to just think outside the box. You need to get together a team of like-minded people, and come up with new ideas. You need to innovate. Experiment. And educate – so that others can learn from your mistakes.","When you travel through rural places in Cambodia, where large families have very little income, and as a result little food, but still survive and smile, you realise how important belonging to a supportive community is. It’s hard to get through things by yourself sometimes. But if you’ve got a group of people beside you, who are going through the same issues – the same problems – then you no longer feel alone. The old look after the young – and the young look after the old."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Curse of Black Bones","p":["The amazingly talented director Rhett Dashwood has just wrapped post production on his video clip “Black Bones”, for a great band called Teenagersintokyo. The video clip looks amazing (it was shot on Vision Research’s Phantom high speed camera), however that’s the not the only reason I’m writing about it here.","Like a lot of low-budget productions – in fact any film production for that matter – this one had a lot of hurdles. For instance:","A rouge pyro guy let off fireworks without a permit and blew off his hand meaning the council closed down all pyro for the first day of shooting.","As a result of last years horrific fire season, the production team were worried about total fire bans – however, the day before the scheduled shoot, the weather turned bad and Melbourne had the biggest thunderstorm it has had in ten years!","The production lost half of its crew due to re-scheduling.","The director had a baby! (Congratulations Rhett!)","Only days after shooting, the director found out two of the most important shots in the video clip were in fact corrupt (yes, as you guess, it was the most important explosion shot!).","However, despite all these major problems, the team got through it all… and the clip looks great.","I was personally only involved in the post production stages, and I must say I was tremendously impressed with Rhett’s courage, determination and sheer talent. When he found out that two of the most important shots of the clip were corrupt, and even the experts (i.e. the people who actually make the camera!) couldn’t fix the problem, he still bashed his way through and in the end worked his way around the problem. By actually opening up the CINE files in a HEX editor and manually copying the headers from one working CINE file to the broken CINE file, after a lot of trial and error he eventually got it working. Not bad work considering how many people told him they the clip was broken and couldn’t be fixed.","The point is, with all film-making ventures you need to think out-side-the-box, and just keep chipping away at problems. Rhett didn’t give up when things go too hard – as each problem presented itself, he and the rest of his talented team found a way around it.","This is why I love film-making… the people. The sheer determination to get things done.","Again, congratulations Rhett (Director), Ari Wegner(Cinematographer), The Butchery(Editing), Digital Pictures(Online/Grade) and Teenagersintokyo.

It booted fine, and loaded Snow Leopard. “Ah, no” I thought to myself, and added a mental note that the first thing I will need to do it get rid of Snow Leopard. But, while it’s up and running, I might as well check out some of the new Snow Leopard features. Then I noticed it. Something was not right. For about half a second every five seconds the computer seemed to “stall”. It would just stop for half a second. It was almost as if it had a faulty heart and was missing a beat every now and again. I’ve never seen this before, so I was a little bit scared that maybe this brand new machine might had serious hardware problems. Either that – or Snow Leopard was causing the poor machine some major, major grief. So first thing I did after a diagnostics test (in which the machine passed all tests), was try and dump Snow Leopard and put on Leopard 10.5. I put in the Retail DVD of Leopard we have, clicked install, and waited for the machine to reboot. Then nothing happened. Ummm… Strange! Why wasn’t it booting? I tried another Retail DVD of Leopard we have. Same problem. Ummm… very strange! Time for Google. I hit my first major stumbling block – you can only install Leopard 10.5.6 or later on these new MacPro’s and all our Retail DVDs are 10.5. With no copy of Leopard 10.5.6 on DVD, and no dealers stocking 10.5.6 on the shelves, it was time to sent it back to the retailer so that they can install 10.5.6 and work out what’s going on with the strange freezing issue. We can always grab another copy of 10.5.6 on DVD from Apple’s discontinued software division later (as we’ll need to install the OS again on other partitions anyway).","And so, the Mac went back to the shop. The weird thing however was that the machine worked perfectly once they received it. No lagging, no freezing – it worked perfectly. So they installed 10.5.6, ran the diagnostics tool, swapped out the RAM as a precaution, and sent it back to us. They did say however that they have come across this issue once before, and put it down to electromagnetic interference in the room it was being used in – putting the machine in another room seemed to fix the problem. Very strange!","And then I found the solution. For some reason certain monitors connected via the DVI port cause the system to lag (i.e. literally freeze for half a second every five or so seconds) if connected via the DVI or Mini DisplayPort. However, all monitors seem to work fine over VGA using adapters.","Best Regards, Chris !","Doesn’t Work over DVI or Mini DisplayPort: Samsung 940B 4:3 LCD Benq T2200HD (Model: W2108) 16:9 LCD Benq G2200W (Model: ET-0016-N) 16:9 LCD","Happy editing!","Here is a list of monitors I tried:","I got it back, plugged it in, and the same issue occurred.

The more time I have to spend with Avid, and the more time I have to work out viable workflows of getting stuff into and out of it, the more things will hopefully become clear in my head. I will certainly post anything I think is useful here. One thing’s for certain… after looking through so many Avid forums, and reading hundreds of articles randomly scattered on the web, it’s clear that I’m not the only one that’s confused.

I think something is up with how Avid presents the image samples to the quicktime compression session. I suspect that given the absence of the ‘nclc’ extension which describes the colorimetry in the output QT file, Media Composer gives the codec no information as to the colorimetry of the samples, so the codec makes a best guess. Of course with the Avid codecs this works (the problem is with decode on FCP and not in the encoding), but with third-party codecs such as Apple ProRes there is a problem. As a result gamma correction is incorrectly applied to the source samples when it should not be. It would be nice if this would be addressed for greater compatibility with other software…..","I then brought the test footage into the Avid as OMF, 1:1, 601.

As we solely do offline editing here and all of the grading and online is done at other more specialised post production facilities, generally speaking we don’t have to worry too much about gamma, colour spaces and getting files in and out of various programs. Most of our jobs are shot on 35mm, and get telecined to DVCAM which we then edit in DV-PAL, export an EDL + OMF and we’re done. For RED Projects we normally get dumped a hard drive full of R3Ds which we convert to DNxHD using RED Rushes and bring all these files in Avid via an ALE. Everything is fairly simple and straight forward.","If you look at all the different methods – this certainly seems to be the case. When using the same file pixel to video mapping setting for both import and export the file coming in is very SIMILAR to the file coming out – not EXACTLY – but very similar.","If you want to export a tiff sequence you can use either color space you want, just make note of which you use and make sure that whoever you give it to knows which you use.

Just to double check I then exported out the same timeline but with the Compressor set to None to see what would happen:","Odd (Upper Field First) Odd (Upper Field First) ordered: Choose this option if the file was odd ordered and you are importing it into an even ordered format. For example, importing PAL DV into PAL.","OK – so it seems that it is possible to get footage into and out of Avid without the image being degraded.","OK, so now that brings us to the final test of the day. For this test I will capture some standard PAL DV footage into Avid and then export it and try to bring it into Final Cut Pro, hopefully without introducing any strange artefacts, field dominance issues or gamma/luma shifts.","OK… So now I had a Quicktime file that identically matched the TIFF test chart.","OK… so now what I want to have a quick look at is the difference between the vector scopes in Avid and Final Cut Pro using the same source footage.","OK… So now what? What’s the result of all of these tables and charts?","OK… so obviously Quicktime is doing something funky behind the scenes. This is something we’ll have to look into later, but for now the purpose of this test is to try and get footage into and back out of Avid without any nasty changes. As long as we know what the values are of the chart before the footage gets into Avid, it doesn’t really matter if the values aren’t “correct” (i.e. Grey 71 on the chart doesn’t have to equal 71 using the eye dropper).","Once I had a test chart the next step was to convert it to a Quicktime file.

Now, before you all drill me, yes I know I’m running an older version of Avid, and yes I know that technically speaking I’m running a newer version of Quicktime than I should be (as you can see by reviewing the Avid Version Matrix). But as more and more people tend to run Avid and Final Cut Pro on the same system, the more I see Avid running alongside newer versions of Quicktime that what the developers originally intended. As Avid is completely backwards compatible (which is both amazing and EXTREMELY handy!), the less often people tend to upgrade the Avid software. If it ain’t broke – why fix it?","Unlike in Final Cut Pro, getting consistent images into and out of Avid seems to be kind of a black art. The RGB vs 601 terminology is at times confusing, and despite the wealth of information out there on the World Wide Web – there still seems to be a lot of misinformation and head scratching. Even creating a dead simple DVD via DVD Studio Pro using Avid footage seems to be a real challenge (the solution on forums normally tends to be use one of Avid’s Sonic products).","Visually comparing the original file to the file exported out of Avid, what I can say is that they are identical in terms of colour and tone. You cannot tell the difference between the two:","Well the main difference between RGB and 601 color space is the ability to have super white and negative black.","Well, rather than spend even more time trying to find answers on the various Avid forums, I thought I’d do some tests and see how things actually work in the real world. This isn’t a formal experiment, nor is it anything like a technical white paper – all I’m really doing is having a bit of a muck-around and documenting what I do for future reference. It’s more for myself than anything else, to try and help get my head around everything. So apologies in advance if this blog entry is a bit of a mess!","When encoding to the Avid Meridien Uncompressed (AVUI) codec the settings dialog (‘Avid Meridien Uncompressed Codec Configuration – v1.8.0’) lets you specify the input color range as either ITU-R 601 video-range [16..235] or full-range [0..255]. However, QuickTime does not provide any mechanism to specify settings for a decoder. QuickTime unequivocally defines the ARGB pixel format as having full-range components, so the fact that AVID’s AVUI decompressor outputs video-range ARGB is just wrong.","When I export your sample to Sheer Y’CbCr[A] 8bv 4:2:2:[4] with QuickTime Player, QuickTime Player feeds the images to the Sheer Y’CbCr[A] 8bv 4:2:2[:4] encoder in the RGB 8bf ‘ARGB’ pixel format. I find this odd, since the Avid Meridien Uncompressed (AVUI) codec purportedly stores the data in Y’CbCr[A] 8bv 4:2:2[:4] format. On inspecting the AvidAVUICodec, I see that ARGB is the only pixel format that the AVUI codec supports for input and output; it lacks the ‘cpix’ resource used to list other supported pixel formats.","When the field ordering (or spatial field position) of the imported media matches the field ordering of the project format, no special processing is required.

It’s also got an amazing resume database. As Happy Sundaes is now just a showcase tool for us, by putting it up on IMDB after people watch it they can then follow links to the IMDB pages of all the cast and crew. The hope is that if people like Happy Sundaes, they’ll click the link to our actors, and then get in touch with their agents.","SAKOOZ on the other hand is a bit different.

Moreover, an Apple minilaptop will be unlikely to compete in price cuts and may cost as much as another premium Atom machine, the Sony Vaio P.”","As most of you will know, I recently wrote an article on this blog listing my Final Cut Studio 3 Predictions. It has gotten a really great response so far, and has helped generate a lot of incredibly interesting discussions. Regardless of whether my predictions come true or not, I think the article has really helped throw some new ideas and concepts into the public domain and has sparked a lot of imagination in some extremely talented people, which is fantastic. I’ve gotten lots of messages, e-mails and comments recently with cool technology and features which should be added into Final Cut Pro – some of which I really hope make it into the next version. Personally I think the more people talk about these kinds of things in a public forum, the more chance Apple developers will get ideas from these discussions, and the more chance they will actually think about implementing them.","But today I’m not going to talk about software. I’m going to talk about the other end of the spectrum… hardware.","Even since people started discovering that Apple has been applying for various touch-screen patients the Internet community has been going wild. The funny this is that most people think that they’re working on a Kindle Killer. Alex Lindsay from This Week In Media has been predicting a Kindle-like device that supports video and has a colour screen for months now. Geeks on Twitter, various Mac blogs, and all the Apple rumour sites have been going crazy in recent months predicting Apple Tablets.","I tend to agree. Apple isn’t going to make a laptop unless it can easily run the power-hungry applications in it’s iLife suite with ease. iPhone as they currently stand are basically just a more compact version of a netbook anyway. As cloud computing becomes more the norm, and as more people jump on board Mobile Me I think more and more people will start their job on their MacBook and automatically sync everything up to their iPhone. They’ll be able to put together their presentation in KeyNote on the MacBook, but then make changes before they step onto the stage on their iPhone. I don’t see the need for a netbook (after all who wants to cart around yet ANOTHER piece of technology), and I don’t think Apple does either.","Ok, lets be harsh for a minute. Kindle’s are geared towards older people. They’ve been developed as a “book replacement”. Older people love them because they are easy to read. You can change the text size. They’re simple to operate, buying digital books is fairly easy, and you can carry the Kindle around in your giant handbag. Lots of people over 40 really love their Kindle. They’re a great mothers and fathers day gift. That said of course, lots of younger people love them (a.k.a the amazingly talented, intelligent and witty Daisy Whitney), but most of them are “books nerds” from way back. I don’t think Apple wants to make a leap into the “book nerd” territory. Apple is all about being cool and innovative. As I said, I think Apple thinks print media is dead. I love books personally – you have no idea how many film books I have lying around in my house, or how much money I spent of film related books of all varieties! However, the though of buying digital books doesn’t interest me in the slightest. Just like I love having a whole pile of physical DVDs – I love having a book shelf full of books. I think that Apple has realised that people who just love books like I do, will never accept a digital equivalent. I think that Apple has realised that most young people who can be bothered reading, will be happy to read on their iPhone or iPod Touch. And I think that Apple has decided that although there is a market for digital books on a nice and simple digital book reader (like the Kindle) – it’s a market that they’re not particularly interested in.","OK… so the tablet idea is out… what about the netbook? Well I think that’s out too. As others have clearly said:","Personally, I don’t think Apple is working on a “bigger version of the iPhone”. What’s the point? If you want to read something on the train, you can use your iPhone or iPod Touch. If that’s not big enough, then get a laptop. If neither work for you, then just get a Kindle. That’s what they’re designed for. I don’t think there is a big enough need for Apple to create a tablet just to tackle the “digital book” market. I know it sounds silly – but I think Apple regard traditional books (you know, the paper variety) as dead. Text mixed with video and interactive multimedia is the new black.","So that’s my prediction as of today. No Kindle Killer. No bigger-version-of-the-iPhone tablet. No less-powerful-than-a-MacBook netbook. I think Apple will just introduce “touch” to the whole product range. However, leaving the best till last, I also predict that on the MacBook Air, you’ll be able to “slide” the screen around, essentially turning it into a tablet. It won’t be called a tablet, it’ll just be a MacBook Air Touch (or something like that).","So where does that leave us? Tablets are out. Netbooks are out. So what is Apple planning to do exactly?","Steve Jobs has explicitly said he doesn’t want to make a netbook and that “there are no plans to make a tablet” – so why is everyone so convinced that Apple is working on something that will go head-to-head with the popular, but hardly world changing, Kindle?","This changeover to touchable screens will bring the whole Apple product line, into, well, line! Everything from a MacPro to a MacBook to an iPhone and iPod Touch will be running MacOS and have a touch screen. It’s an advertising agency’s dream! Imagine the Mac vs PC ads now…","This is my crazy prediction… Apple is planning to kill the mouse. I think that when Apple releases it’s new Operating System (which already supports touch and some pretty cool character recognition), it will also update all it’s hardware to include touch screens, remove mice from the inventory list, but include a new “multi-touch keyboard” with each MacPro tower and Mac mini. The keyboard will basically be exactly the same as you’ll find on a 17″ MacBook Pro – touchpad included.","Well… you’re going to call me crazy. You’re going to think that I’m out of my mind. But my prediction is that by the end of next year, every Mac will be touchable. That’s right. I think that every MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Apple Cinema Display and iMac will have a touch screen. I also predict that the MacBook and MacBook Pro will replace the Multi-Touch Trackpad with a fully functional multi-touch tablet.","Why you may ask? Because it will not only be really cool – but also speed things up dramatically. For instance, right now I have two screens sitting in front of me. I’m typing something in a web browser. But say I want to quickly open a document that’s sitting on my desktop which contains a whole lot of notes. To do that I’ll have to lift my hands of the keyboard, grab the mouse, move it over to the icon and click. How much easier would it be if I could just reach for the screen and double tap directly.","Will I be right? As always, only time will tell… I think we’ll find out if I’m crazy slightly before we find out if my FCX predictions are on track… Fingers crossed!","Will it happen? Yes it will. When, well that’s a bit more tricky. It all comes down to money and technology. I have a sneaky suspicion that we’ll see this kind of thing much sooner than anyone could possibly predict. I have a feeling Apple has been working on this for a while. Although I have no facts, or no evidence what-so-ever to base this on, hell, it’s just a good old fashion guess, but I can imagine that Apple might announce something at the same time as it’s Snow Leopard unveiling.","With Windows 7 coming out, which surprisingly actually works, and works quite well, and with PC hardware prices coming down, Apple needs more things to separate Mac hardware from PC hardware. The super slick operating system is not enough any more. Despite what Mac enthusiast may tell you, Microsoft is catching up again (admittedly by stealing most of Apple’s ideas and concepts!). Apple needs to push the boundaries once more, and having “touchable computers” seems like the logical step forward. They have the cool factor, but they also will help speed up everyday tasks. In the pro world of video and stills photography, I think it will be even more ground breaking. Most visual effects artists love their tablet, but imagine if they could combine their traditional Wacom tablet with two nice and big 24″ touchable LED Cinema Displays!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"no-time-free-cake-and-lots-of-hits","l":"No time, free cake and lots of hits!","p":["Hello everyone!

Avid converts everything to MXFs of OMFs whereas Final Cut Pro converts everything to Quicktimes. This doesn’t bother me in the slightest. People complain about the transcode times. Do it while you’re sleeping. People complain about requiring so much hard drive space. Hard drives are cheap now. I don’t think this is really a limitation at all.","And so, for the past five years I’ve been using Final Cut Pro extensively. I’ve thrown all kinds of footage at it from DV to HDV, XDCAM to DVCProHD, 10-Bit Uncompressed Telecine Transfers to RED. I love Final Cut Pro. It’s powerful, flexible, fast, and cheap. Plus, everyone knows how to use it.","And so, when my ex-film school peers ask me which is better, I reply… “I love them both, equally”. I hate to be the kind of guy that sits on the fence, but the reality is they’re pretty much exactly the same in my opinion. They both do the same things – just a bit differently.","Another thing that people generally always say is that the media management in Final Cut Pro sucks. Everyone seems to agree that this is the case – from film school students, to random people on Twitter to professionals. Everyone, except me. Personally, I think that the way Avid and Final Cut Pro handle files is pretty much the same – and yes, I know this is going to cause all kinds of arguments. When I set up a new Final Cut Pro project, I set up a new folder structure on an external hard drive (on an unrelated topic – I name all my external drives after pet dogs I’ve come across in the past):","As so, with the help of Final Cut Express, my brother got his two films, God’s Handiwork and Hello Sunshine. With those now finished, and high school completed, my brother then also moved away from film-making heading to univeristy to study Arts/Science. But we now had all this gear, and the inventory was continuing to grow (we purchased a Sony Z1P as soon as it came out). And so, after working for two years as a lighting designer for live events – an amazing job which took me all over the country and many times overseas – I decided to head back to school, studying Film & Television at university.","Avid Crashes Once Again","Avid on the other hand is a workhorse. It can handle feature films with ease. The boot up time is almost instant in most cases. It’s not bullet proof – but I’ve never lost media, render files, or work because of a random bug or error – in comparison to Final Cut Pro where I’ve lost whole projects temporarily (thank goodness for the Autosave vault!). If I know I’m going to be working with a lot of media, then Avid will always be my first preference.","Best Regards, Chris!","By far my FAVOURITE thing about Avid is the way it handles project files. The fact that you can simply copy and paste a bin on the finder level is so much better than the way Final Cut Pro handles things. Sure you can export out an XML file in Final Cut Pro – but it’s so much easier to just be able to copy and paste a bin. From an assistants point of view – this is invaluable! I can just copy and paste bins to the editor and the new bins magically appear in his project. Amazing!","Either way, I know it’s cliche, but as every editor will tell you, it’s not the tools that make a great film – it’s the talented editor who’s TELLING A STORY. It’s easy to get bogged down in technology, and Final Cut vs Avid discussions – but at the end of the day use the tool that works.","Final Cut Pro has served me extremely well. However, when I took up an editing assistant job earlier this year, I discovered that I’d have to learn Avid. And so, for the past 12 weeks or so, I’ve been using Avid on a daily basis. And guess what… I love it just as much as I love Final Cut Pro.","Final Cut Pro is like a Swiss army knife. You can basically throw anything at it and do things quickly. It can basically tackle any Quicktime file you throw at it, and within minutes you can get from the Final Cut Pro timeline to an exported DVD. It’s quick and sometimes nasty. Everyone knows how to use it (and even if they don’t know, they can learn the basics within hours) – so if you get sick someone else can take over the project with ease. As long as the project is set up correctly from the get-go, and you have some kind of self control in terms of managing files, then you shouldn’t run into too many (if any!) reconnection issues. Final Cut Pro is GREAT for short projects. It’s the perfect short film tool. However for longer projects it dies. It doesn’t handle masses of footage well at all. If you have 40 or so hours of footage in the project, it can take up to 15 minutes to boot up even on the fastest Mac. If you have hundreds of sequences within a project, you can run into all kinds of “Out of Memory” problems. Sure there are workaround – such as using a different project for each scene. But that’s a pain.","Finally, I still stand by my prediction that the next version of Final Cut Studio will change EVERYTHING. I’m sorry, but there is no way in hell Apple is going to watch Avid dramatically improve their packages, lower the prices dramatically, and just do nothing. I’m extremely confident that Apple has something new and amazing hidden away in some dark and smelly room somewhere. But, that said, Avid is now a completely different company. They’ve changed. For the better. They are actually listening to their customers, and seriously improving their software.","Folder Structure","For every single project I work on, I have a Final Cut workspace folder. This contains everything to do with the project – render files, caches, stills, graphics, audio, etc. The advantage of this is that when I open up the project on another Mac, everything is there, and ready to go. No need to re-render. No need to reconnect. Everything just works. The disadvantage is that I need to change the Capture Scratch and Cache paths every time I open a project. However, this only takes about 7 seconds, so it’s not that much of a pain. I very rarely open two project files at once unless it’s a massive film I’m working on such as a feature (and almost never open two different films at the same time, so I don’t get any nasty problems like render files being saved to the wrong project workspace).","For my brothers final year of high school, he decided to do Studio Arts, and produce two short films. As he’d never really done any film-making before, and I was working full time as a lighting designer (so I had money!), I decided to go on a bit of a spending spree and purchase some things. So one day we had nothing apart from a little Sony MiniDV camera – the next we had a portable green screen, boom pole, ME66 microphone, some basic tungsten lighting, makeshift steadicam, a few Lacie drivers, and a copy of Final Cut Express 2 and DVD Studio Pro (standalone) to put on a new eMac.","Generally speaking, I think that Avid crashes just as much as Final Cut Pro – when you’re not doing “normal” stuff. For example, if I’m just doing a rough cut of DV-PAL footage on Final Cut Pro, with just simple cuts and simple dissolves, then everything will just work. No crashes, no stalls, no bizarre error messages. Everything will just work. Same as with Avid. However, as soon as you start pushing the boundaries a bit – things start going wrong. For example, in Final Cut Pro, if you’re working with heaps of different formats on your timeline, with thousands of hours of footage in your project file, and a bunch of image sequences, PSD files, etc. you’re bound to have problems. Things will go wrong. The project will take a long time to open. Obviously there are work arounds (such as splitting up your project into multiple projects, etc.) but they’re not ideal. Avid is the same. I’ve been doing some temporary visual effects compositions in Avid for an offline for a television commercial. The reason they were done in Avid was so that when we hand the EDL over to the effects company – they know what footage they need to use. Avid is FANTASTIC for this kind of thing. I love the AniMatte effect – it’s far better than anything Final Cut has. However, once you have twelve tracks of video all with a colour correction and a couple of mattes – Avid starts to panic a bit. Strange errors start popping up. Things stop working normally. Having said that though – I’ve never had Avid crash (i.e. the program close) on me before. It’s crashed a couple of times on load due to a dodgy file in the OMFI folder – but it’s never died whilst I’ve been doing something important. It’s given me lots of cryptic error messages – but so has Final Cut.","Happy Editing! Feel free to leave your comments, suggestions, abuse, ideas, etc. below! I’d love to hear from you!","Having said all that – Avid does seem a lot more stable. The timeline responsiveness is incredible. Final Cut Pro is generally pretty good when you wizz around the timeline, but at times it seems to slow down for no particular reason. Avid is fast. Always fast. I like that. I like that a lot.","I love the way Avid handles users and preferences. The fact that when you boot up Avid you’re presented with an option to select a project you wish to open, plus select a user preference is fantastic. It’s so simple, so logical, yet so incredible. Why oh why can’t Final Cut Pro introduce this? The only thing that I don’t like about Avid is the one thing that may people love about it! Whenever I change projects, I need to also change the OMFI folders around. It would be great if when you opened a project you could also select which “media folder” you wanted to use.","If you’re doing a long form project – unless you have an amazing assistant editor who’s extremely technically proficient and patient – I’d stick with Avid. It’s got an unchallenge amazing track record.","If you’re doing a short film – then maybe Final Cut Pro is the go.","If you’re working with lots of different editors, or if it’s a big project, then Avid is the winner, although you can do these kinds of projects with Final Cut Pro. Personally I prefer the ability to easily copy and paste bins than using XML files.","In terms of actual editing (i.e. the creative stuff) Avid and Final Cut are very different. It took me a while to get out of the habit of being able to quickly drag and drop like you can in Final Cut Pro, but within two or three days, I’ve quickly adapted to the new way of thinking. I really like the way Avid works and can see why editors love it (especially the more old school editors from the days were you had to physically “cut and paste” film). Avid seems hard core and industrial – whereas Final Cut seems more like a sexy new toy. That said though, I personally think a good Final Cut Pro editor can be just as quick as a really good Avid editor. I don’t think one method of working is better than the other – just different.","Just for the record – I’ve used Vegas and Premiere in the past as well – but only for individual projects. I haven’t played with the latest version of either. I also haven’t played with the latest version of Avid – although I’m really looking forward to testing out the new AMA architecture within the next few weeks.","My second favourite thing about Avid is the way it handles settings. You can easily copy and paste settings and rename them. For example, you might have a couple of different configurations for deck setups. Instead of having to change all the settings around each time you change decks, you can just uncheck one configuration and check the other. You can have multiple keyboard configurations in the one user profile. The Avid is amazingly customisable. You can basically change EVERYTHING to suit your needs.","Ok… so, one of the most common things I hear is, “Final Cut crashes all the time… but Avid is bullet proof…”. Well, although I’ve had my fair share of Final Cut Pro crashes over the years, I have to say, from my experiences, Avid is far from perfect! Admittedly I’m using 3.0.5 at work – so it’s not the latest version, but that’s really no excuse.","One thing for certain is that I think Avid will eventually get rid of the EDL Manager and DigiTranslator, and put this functionality directly into the Avid application. I think integration between ProTools and Avid will also become almost transparent. But I also think that the integration between Final Cut Pro and ProTools will become better. I finally think Avid has decided to stop fighting Apple and start working out ways to get their software in front of the eyes of Final Cut Pro fanatics.","One thing that Avid wins hand down on is the default keyboard mapping. I’ve grown up with Final Cut Pro, so I’ve never really thought too much about it. Until I started working with Avid. The default Avid layout isn’t perfect – but it’s so much better than Final Cut! Make sure you check out the Keyboard Manifesto on the ProVideo Coalition site. Scott allows you to download a great “Avid-like” keyboard layout to “fix up” Final Cut Pro. However, that said, I can see why Apple have mapped the keyboard the way they have. It’s logical. Sure, it may not be fast. But film students can literally walk up to a Final Cut Pro workstation and have a fair idea of what everything does. When they walk up to an Avid – they have no idea. Avid makes the most sense once you’ve been shown once what everything is – but Final Cut Pro makes sense from the onset.","So in conclusion… both Avid and Final Cut Pro are great tools that both can help achieve amazing works of art. Both are far from perfect. Both have bugs. Both needs improving. But I think every editor should have both on their system.","So in that sense – for my workflow – both Avid and Final Cut Pro work the same way. I keep the media in one place and never have any reconnection issues. Of course if I just drag a file from the desktop into Final Cut Pro without first moving it into my workplace – then I’m going to have reconnection issues if I move to another Mac. But I’m a fairly organised person, so I always put stuff in the right place. For those people who are too lazy or forgetful, then do yourself a favour an purchase a copy of Loader from Digital Heaven.","So what do I like about Avid much more than I do about Final Cut?","So, over the next couple of weeks, as my brother was in preproduction for his two films – I quickly got my head around both the Mac platform (as up until now we’d grown up with PCs) and Final Cut Express. To be perfectly honest, I feel instantly in love, with not only Final Cut, but also with Macs in general. They just… well, worked!","So… if Avid has all these amazing features, why don’t I just change? Well, originally it was just a matter of price. Final Cut Pro is DEAD cheap whereas Avid WAS incredibly expensive. This is changing. But, personally, I think I’m going to be one of those annoying people who is constantly switching between Avid and Final Cut Pro. Why? Because they are both fantastic tools – and they basically do exactly the same thing – it’s just that they are both better at different things.","The colour corrector in Avid is amazing. It’s so powerful and so easy to use. Apple’s 3-way Colour Corrector is a toy in comparison. However, that said, Final Cut Studio comes with Color – which despite what some people may tell you, is amazing. Sure it has some bugs in it – but they’ll be worked out in time. In the meantime there is always workarounds. Most people hate the interface – but I think it makes sense. Sure it’s not very Apple – but who really cares. As long as it creates amazing looks – which it does.","The effects in Avid are a lot better than Final Cut. I love the AniMatte. It reminds me of After Effects. I wish Final Cut Pro had something like this without having to install some expensive 3rd party plugin.","The film school I went to was a Final Cut Pro facility, and so I upgraded from Final Cut Express to Final Cut Studio – and because I already owned a copy of DVD Studio Pro – the upgrade was incredibly cheap!","There has been a lot of discussion on the Internet over the last few months in regards to Avid vs FCP. People have been blogging about it. Scott Simmons from The Editblog has written many entries over the years discussing this topic, as has Shane Ross on his blog Little Frog in High Def. There has been several sometimes heated podcast discussions about it – although when That Post Show got stuck into the topic at length (almost two train rides long!), the panel of experts remained surprisingly level headed. Although, I think it’s fair to say that John Flowers, the host of the show is very much an Avid man, and tends to show his Avid bias on nearly every episode. As Final Cut Users wait for the long awaited major update – Twitter has been flooded with discussions about what users love about Final Cut Pro and Avid, and what users really hate about both products.","Unless you’re working with a Unity – Avid pretty much works the same way. For each project you had a OMFI Media files folder (if you’re working with OMF files) or an Avid MediaFiles folder (if you’re working in MXF files). Sure you can store content for multiple projects in the same media folder, just like you can in Final Cut Pro – but that just makes life more confusing when the time comes to moving projects around. So, I much prefer to have a new OMFI folder for each project.","Up until the end of February this year, I have been a Final Cut Pro man. But just to give you some background, as a young child, well before NLEs were available cheaply on personal computers, I did editing the old fashion way between two VHS domestic recorders. Sound mixing was done “on the fly” using a cool four channel Realistic microphone mixer. It was a horrible system – but it worked. Many a Star Wars fan movie was thrown together in my grandparents back yard. As I grew older, and progressed through Primary School, I moved away from film making temporarly becoming more interested in electric guitars, amplifiers and concert lighting. Towards middle years of high school I had another bash at making films – this time I did all the editing on Premiere on a PC. We recorded everything using Panasonic handycams with VHS-C tapes, and then using one of those cool VHS tape adapters, we captured everything using a normal domestic VHS deck. Once again, I drifted away from films, becoming more interested in live productions."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"chris-featured-on-kaltura-developers-site","l":"Chris featured on Kaltura Developers Site!","p":["Kaltura has just released it’s brand new Developers Community website, and I’ve actually been fortunate enough to feature in the developers spotlight! Below is a quick little video of all the people featured in the developers spotlight (powered by the Kaltura player) – you’ll have to skip forward a couple of people to see me…","For those that don’t know, Kaltura has developed the first open source video platform for video management, creation, interaction and collaboration.

Once we’ve nailed down the SAKOOZ trailer, we may even allow users to remix some of our other projects, such as Happy Sundaes and Superb Menura – so stay tuned!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Two Fists One Heart","p":["A month or so ago, whilst doing some research for the “cut your own trailer” SAKOOZ site, we came across a film called Two Fists One Heart. This is a contemporary story set in Perth Western Australia, about Anthony Argo – a young Italian/Australian boxer played by Daniel Amalm– being pushed to the limit by his Sicilian father and trainer, Joe ( Ennio Fantastichini). Joe wants Anthony to achieve the success in the ring that he was denied as a young man. When Anthony meets Kate (played by the stunning Jessica Marais– from the television series Packed to the Rafters), he begins to see his life – and the role violence – in a different light. He loses focus on boxing and, in a confrontation with his father, learns about Joe’s painful past. Joe turns his back on his son. Anthony leaves the ring spending time with Kate in their blossoming romance. He earns his living as a nightclub bouncer . When Anthony becomes involved in a street fight at a public event Kate dumps him. Anthony reflects on who he is and all that he has recently lost. Tom (played by the amazingly talented Tim Minchin– who I had no idea actually did screen acting!), Kate’s comedian brother helps Anthony see the world and his life from a different perspective Joe is betrayed by Nico (played by Rai Fazio– who also wrote the screenplay), another boxer of Sicilian decent. Anthony, now mature enough to make his own decisions, decides to honour his father and his family and re enters the ring to fight his nemesis Nico.","Although the competition has now closed – the general idea was that the public can cut together their own scene, and submit it for review.The best five scenes will be posted on Disney’s promotional site for the film (obviously this is a great opportunity for some exposure to high-profile people in the film industry). These five best scene cuts will be selected by Bill Russo head of Editing at the AFTRS and the creative team from the film. Interestingly, Director Shawn Seet, Editor Milena Romanin and Cinematogropher Hugh Miller are all graduates from AFTRS, Australia’s premiere Film and Television school.","As we’re in the process of trying to build a similar campaign for the SAKOOZ trailer, this was a really great project to study. The fact that you could download the rushes (as opposed to editing the trailer online) is something that really interests us. However, I think by making people download large files and edit them on their own system (whether they use Mac or PC, Avid or FCP, Premiere or Vegas, Windows Movie Maker or iMovie…) as opposed to just being able to cut something together in the comfort of a web browser, means that the campaign attracts more to geeks and professionals, as opposed to just general movie goers. As a lot of geeks and professionals will probably go see the movie regardless, I’m not sure if this kind of thing will actually attract more audience numbers to the cinemas. What I’m now considering for the SAKOOZ site (and for future “cutting your own version” sites), it having the option – you can either edit online (we are currently working very closely with the team at Kaltura), or download and cut it together using your own tools.","Best Regards, Chris!","Directed by Sydney-based Shawn Seet– who traditionally has mainly done television directing and editing as well as being awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in the 2001 Queen’s New Years Honours Lis for his services to Australian society and to Australian film production – this film is sure to be a hit, especially given that At the Movies gave it some a positive review. It will be very interesting to see how this film goes at the box office…","Finally – if you edited your own version of the scenes, feel free to let us know via the comments system at the bottom of this page! We’d love to see your interpretation of the scenes!","For your viewing pleasure, here are some of the edits I threw together:","Happy editing!","I downloaded the rushes a few months ago now, and used them to really get to grips with Avid (as I’ve done most of my cutting in Final Cut Pro in the past). Trying to cut together a real scene (as opposed to some dodgy video footage supplied with most books and tutorials), was really handy. Just getting on with the job, and learning as I went, was extremely beneficial.","If you haven’t already downloaded the rushes and had a play – I highly recommend you do! They’re great for practising your craft, and would also make a terrific training tool.","Ignoring the actual film for a minute – the thing that really caught our attention was their online presence. As well as the official movie site, they also had two other promotional sites. One of them teaches you how to throw a punch, and the other features a Cut Your Own Scene competition. It’s the latter that really got us interested.","It’s really interesting watching what other people have done. For example, I just watched this version– although it’s cut together OK, it seems a bit all over the place, and doesn’t really have a nice flow to it. Also, you don’t really get an insight into the characters at all. This version of another scene is a lot better – but it seems really fast. I also don’t really like the dissolve at the start. This version of the fight scene however works HEAPS better than mine. At the time of playing with this scene, I was too afraid to use jump cuts, and I really tried to make it flow naturally – but it never really worked. I used far too many instances of the one cutaway (the young worker looking through the window). In retrospect, I think the use of fast jump cuts and really making the action zip past would have worked a lot better. I’ve also been told you should never have characters both enter and exit a sense – you should either have one or the other. This is hard when you’re only cutting one scene, with no overall context – but I think the rule is still a good one, and may have helped me with some of the other scenes.","None of these edits are particularly amazing – although I did spend a fair bit of time on Scene C to try and get it flowing a lot nicer. The lack of coverage was a bit tricky – and really added to the challenge. I didn’t have time to really fix up the audio or grade the footage either – so you’re really seeing a first pass of an offline edit.","On the site, you can download five scenes, and some sound effects and temp score and basically do what you want with it (under the condition that you link back to their site if you display it online). The footage is in “rushes” form – meaning the footage has a logo on it, isn’t colour graded and has timecode burnt into it. Although they don’t give you all the footage for each scene (and if they actually do, then they really shot VERY little coverage for each scene), and the “rushes” have been edited together to look like rushes (i.e. slates have been added in for the hell of it, random footage has been added, useful footage has been removed) – you’re still provided with some useful footage, and it’s great to play around with.","Overall – I think this campaign was a really good idea, and I’d love to see some statistics on how many people actually downloaded the rushes and submitted entries for the competition. Looking at YouTube search results, there doesn’t seem to be that many people that got into it which is a real shame. Although the fact that the site moved their rushes over to Amazon Web Services probably means that at least a lot of people were downloading the files. I guess at the end of the day any publicity is good publicity, and the most people that talk about the film the better.","Regardless of all this – we highly recommend you go and see the film at the movies and support Australian films! And when it comes out on DVD – buy that as well! I’m sure there’ll be some great special feature on that one…","Scene A (Rough Cut 001)","Scene B (Rough Cut 001)","Scene C (Rough Cut 005)","Scene E (Rough Cut 001)","You can download my Avid Project for the scene here if you like. You’ll need to download all the media yourself though and re-link it. Originally I planned to log all the clips in Final Cut Pro as well – but never got around to it. If you edited the scenes in Final Cut and want to offer your project file on this site, let me know!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"dont-worry-were-not-dead-just-busy","l":"Don’t worry… We’re not dead!

Because not only did it caught such massive reactions in the audience, despite the fact that it was a small audience. Not only is it a really great film. But it was shot in Melbourne. On a RED camera. With an Australian director. And it looked epic. It looked big. It looked as good as any other blockbuster film I’ve seen this year. Just, if not more, impressive as Watchmen. This is what excites me. It just gives me hope that one that I’ll be able to make a film like this. Massive, visually stunning films are not just restricted to America (although that said, I already knew this – I mean, just look at some of the crazy VFX driven films coming out of places like Korea and Russia!). It gives me hope. It inspires me.","For those that have been living under a rock – here’s the basic synopsis: John Koestler’s son gets the most chilling drawing from a time capsule. It contains numbers that predict deadly events that have occurred and that will occur.","From the moment this film started, to the very last title (how strange is it seeing the RED logo next to Fuji), I was engaged. I was scared shit-less in sections. I was glued to the screen. I felt the music section and score was incredible. Marco BeltramiI, was the man in front of the orchestra, who also did the original compositions for I, Robot. Michael McMenomy– an Aussie – did the sound design. From what I can gather, this is the first time he’s taken on the role of Sound Designer for a feature film – although he’s worked in the sound department for many successful Australian and Hollywood films in the past. I loved the whispering. In surround, in an VMAX theatre – well, it just sent chills down my spine. It moved me. Physically.","How can we make this happen? We need to ensure that people watch Australian films. People need to watch films like Knowing so that they can help learn to appreciate the fact that we can make big blockbusters down under. As film-makers, we really need to support our “mates” just like Alex is doing. We need to keep making Aussie films (even if they’re not set down under) so that actors like Nadia can keep growing and improving their art – because she’s one talented girl that I’m sure will go far.","I loved the acting. I know I’m in the minority – but generally speaking, I think that Nicolas Cage generally always does a good job. Sure he’s done some bad films – but just look at Lord of War, Adaptation, Con Air, Leaving Las Vegas, Next and all the other great films he’s done. In this film, I think he was superb. I think he completely got into the character, and within seconds I completely forgot he was Nicholas Cage. The kids, Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson were amazing. Throughout the film I kept on wondering what the hell I’d seen Lara in before. Funnily enough, I’ve been cutting together someone’s show reel together the last couple of days, and she features in one of the films I’ve been getting footage from. That’s right – she’s an Aussie. A Melbourne girl. And an incredible little actress.","I loved the fact that this was shot in Melbourne. It’s incredible to see locations that I’ve been to many times before, but are shown in a completely new and unexpected light. Now I know what people in The States must feel like whenever a big blockbuster is released. I think that fact that they made Melbourne look like America is incredible. Sure there were a lot of things that looked very familiar (even little things like that fact that they used “our” exit signs, “our road signs” in long shots, etc.) – but generally speaking, it certainly didn’t feel like the film took place in Australia. It felt American. It felt Hollywood. It felt blockbuster. But not in a tacky negative way. This film was good. Really good. ET and 3rd Encounters good. Hint. Hint.","I loved the look of the film. RED has done it. This film looked just as good as any other blockbuster film I’ve seen in the cinemas this year. Not once did I think, “wait a second, this is digital”. The image quality was exceptional. And that’s watching it in a shopping centre complex movie theatre, on a print that probably been played way too many times before it came before my eyes! For those that have been doubting RED, or complaining that it’s not “good enough” to compete with film – here’s your proof. The film looks incredible. Enough said.","I loved the script. I’ve seen the trailer for the film lots of times before tonight. I’d seen and read a couple of reviews on the film. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At The Movies, seemed to really like it – and generally speaking I trust at least one of their opinions at any given time. So, I thought I knew what I was in for. I was completely wrong. This is not the kind of film were you can work out exactly what’s going to happen just by looking at the poster.","I loved the visual effects. From what I can gather from the end titles – most of the companies involved were Australian – I believe the principle VFX house was Animal Logic. Some of the sequences were absolutely amazing. The only shot I didn’t fully believe was the plane crash landing – just because I thought that the plane itself looked a bit “computery” – but apart from that, I felt that everything else seemed to fit in perfectly. I think if they’d had a Qantas plane crashing, that may have sold it for me, but anyway! Everything was realistic, and in a lot of cases, faultless. To be honest, I was impressed. I was a bit sceptical coming in to the film – because the plane shot featured in all the trailers and promotional videos, and a couple of the other shots looked a bit flimsy on face value – but watching it all in context, I think everything worked, and it worked really well.","I watched this film in a VMAX (i.e. big screen at Village Cinemas) theatre at a big local shopping complex. I caught the 9:30pm session on a Sunday night – so I knew that it wasn’t going to be that crowded. There were about 30 people in the audience – so there were literally hundreds of seats free. Well before the end of the movie at least five people left and never returned. Throughout the movie people awkwardly laughed in various sections to each other saying “what were they thinking”. At the end of the film, one guy in the back row yelled out, “that was the crappiest movie I’ve ever seen”. Several people laughed, and started talking to themselves agreeing. I haven’t been to a movie that caused so many extreme emotions for quite some time – especially in the mainstream cinema. Personally, I think if you can make a film that stirs this many people up – and not simply for the sake of just stirring people up (i.e. there wasn’t extreme violence for the sake of extreme violence, or sex scenes for the sake of sex scenes – everything certainly seemed there to serve a purpose) – is doing it’s job. I don’t think anyone could have walked out of this film feeling as if they weren’t being glued to the screen. Yes, some people walked out – but I think that was more to do with the fact that it was late on a Sunday night, and that they simply didn’t appreciate how magic this film really was.","I’m inspired. I want to swear a lot. In a positive way. But I won’t. At least not at the moment. I’ve literally just got back from the cinema after watching Alex Proyas’ latest film, Knowing. All I can say is… Wow.","I’ve always wanted to do what Peter Jackson has done in New Zealand, and set up a PROPER high end film making community in Melbourne. When you watch films like this, it just makes me think that it’s all possible. We have the talent. We have the technology. There are certainly people out there that have great stories to tell. It’s really only a matter of time.","I’ve been looking forward to watching this film for a long time. There are many reason for this. Firstly, I loved I Robot. The special effects were great – plus it was just a really fantastic film in general. Great score, great script, great acting… great, well everything. Well apart from the mass amounts of product placement – but we’ll let that slip. Secondly, Alex is an Australian. Like most Aussie’s, I like to support our own. Thirdly, most of the film was shot in Melbourne – my home town. And last, but not least – this film was shot on the RED camera. Having work with the RED on the Sakooz trailer, I have a very fond spot in my heart for this unique piece of revolutionary technology. I always planned to see Knowing when it first opened at the cinemas (last Thursday), but I’ve been caught up with heaps of other things. But, tonight, I’ve finally seen it. And I’ll tell you what – the fact that I’m blogging about it late at night just goes to show how much this movie has affected me. As I said… Wow.","If you haven’t seen it – go watch it. It’s an experience. If you’ve already seen it, then leave a comment and tell me what you thought! Am I crazy? Critics seem to be on both sides of the fence.","Ok… so you get the idea that I loved the film. I loved the editing, the sound design, the cinematography, the script… I honestly thought it was a really great film.","Richard Learoyd was the editor – yet again another I, Robot survivor! I knew this is probably getting old – but I thought the editing was exceptional as well. Why you may ask? Because, just as the sound did, the editing kept me on the edge of my seat. When I was expecting one thing, I was presented with something completely different. I was shocked. I was surprised. I was… most importantly… entertained.","Seems simple enough.","Simon Duggan was the DOP – a New Zealander – and another ring-in from I, Robot. It’s great to see that Alex brought together such a tried and tested talented team. The film just looked great. Forget RED for a second. The framing and camera moves were perfect. It’s not about the technically – it’s about visually telling the story. Simon certainly does that!","So, to be honest, I don’t care if you’ve already seen this film, and think I’m on drugs, because you hated it. At least you’ve seen it. This is important. But personally, I think this is a great film. Yes the ending is a bit “out there” – but luckily, no one spoiled it for me, so as I watched it tonight (or last night technically as it’s well past midnight), everything was new and exciting. I love a movie that really moves me. I love a more that inspires me. I love a movie that makes me want to make movies. I love a movie that makes me want to talk about movies. This movie does all these things.","Thanks for reading! And sorry for getting a little carried away… But, hey! Movie making is exciting!","The best thing is, that as I was watching the film, I didn’t once notice that all these people were Aussie’s. It only dawned on me as the titles started rolling. I think this is important. I know most people already know this (especially after Heath won so many awards after his breathing performance in The Dark Knight) – but it just goes to show how much acting talent we have “down under”.","The female co-star in the film, Diana Wayland, played by the stunning Rose Byrne is also… yes, you guessed it. An Aussie – born in Sydney. I thought the chemistry between Nicolas and Rose was great – and she certainly has a lot of screen presence.","The other face that took me a while to place was the beautiful Nadia Townsend. She only plays a minor role in this film – sister to Nicolas Cage – but despite her small amount of screen time she really stands out. I used to watch her bright and early every Saturday morning on the ABC kids show, Head Start. That’s right – she’s another Aussie. Another exceptional young actress."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"the-problem-with-full-time-work","l":"The problem with full time work…","p":["I’m extremely lucky to have landed a fantastic job a few weeks ago as an assistant editor full time this year at a amazing boutique edit house in Melbourne.

After a big day at work, plus a few hours of commuting home, there’s not much time left to get fired up again about all the others things on your to-do list. As always, time in against me. But at least I’m doing something I really enjoy.","But having said all this – despite my ongoing lack of time, I’ve got a huge amount of INCREDIBLE projects in the works. The Sakooz website has been put on a temporary hold yet again – I just need a few days free to get it up and running. This will DEFINITELY be done as soon as possible. I have also just recently come up with a completely new and improved angle for the story, so I will start going back to the drawing boards in terms of the Sakooz script shortly. I’m still on the hunt for a talented script writer to jump on board this one. But all things Sakooz aside for a second, I’ve recently been in discussing with two other writing/directing teams about to very different, yet both incredibly exciting projects.","One of them is a short film adaptation of the highly successful children’s book There’s a Hippopotamus on our Roof Eating Cake. I am currently working with the team to offer them some guidance in how exactly they can get a realistic hippo onto the big screen. This is an EXTREMELY exciting project to be involved in, and although this is not technically a latenite film, we will certainly be heavily involved in the production.","We are also in the early stages of helping develop an online television show about super heroes. Again, this is not technically a latenite film – but we’ll certainly be discussing the production on our site in great detail as time goes on.","So as always – things are certainly happening! There’s never a dull moment here! Our twitter account is slowly gaining momentum as we post relevant industry news, geared towards Melbourne film-maker, and our recent blog entry on Final Cut Studio 3 predictions has been getting a massive amount of hits! Thanks to everyone who has written down a comment! It’s extremely appreciated! If you aren’t follow us on twitter yet – make sure you sign up!","We’ve also recently uploaded a whole lot of old film reviews and articles onto this blog for you all to have a look at. We hope it’s of some interest to you. As always, feel free to leave a question of comment.","Thanks for reading – and well keep you in the loop as to all the exciting things we’ve got in the works!","See you in the soup!","Best Regards, Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"so-many-things-to-do","l":"So many things to do!","p":["The last couple of weeks have been hectic, but unfortunately it’s been mainly projects outside of latenite. I’ve personally been interstate working on various live shows, and have also recently start working full time for a post house in Melbourne on top of lots of other ventures, so the Sakooz site has been put on another temporary hold, which is a bit of a pain. As much as I would love to have it all done by the end of this month (and to be honest, it’s VERY close to being finished), I just don’t think it’s going to happen – especially with the bushfires that keep creping up on us! Therefore, we will be postponing the launch till April just to be on the safe side.","The good news is that we have been working closely with the team from Kaltura, and the online trailer remix function has turned out great! Thanks to everyone who has been helping us with that element of the site!","Also good news is that our last blog entry has been getting a great amount of hits! Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read it, and also for sending us comments via twitter, Facebook and e-mail. It’s always nice to know that people are actually reading this blog! We recently been slowly getting more followers on twitter which is always nice!","And that’s about it for today! Don’t despair however, despite all these other commitments, the cogs are definitely still turning here… Nick has been working hard on several exciting initiatives, and we’re also starting to put together several teams of other people to begin work on some other new and exciting projects that we haven’t yet talked about. So stay tuned! This is going to be an very cool year…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Final Cut Studio 3 Predictions","p":["After you’ve cut together your masterpiece, you can then jump over to the Audio Room. After you’ve clicked the Audio Room tab, your timeline stays the same, but the workarea section of the application changes. Building upon the features of both Logic and Soundtrack Pro, this is were you do all your audio mastering. Any simple audio effects you applied in the Cutting Room automatically transfer over to the Audio Room. There is a powerful real-time audio mixer (with all the automated faders and knobs you can handle), support of virtual instruments, plus all the plug-ins you’ve come to expect from Logic and STP. Plugins that work in Logic, also work in FCX. The sound effects library will no doubt be HUGE – and easily searchable via the Media Room.","Although the interface will look much sexier, and modern – everything will function in a similar way to the current Final Cut Pro. Basically, if you can easily find your way around the current Final Cut application – this change over will be a non-issue. The biggest changes will be an improved Trim Tool and vastly improved Effects Engine.","Best Regards, Chris!","CinemaTools will also be integrated into the Media Room – allowing you to easily go from a ProRes offline, to a 35mm release print.","Cool new features will include a full screen bin browser (much like iMovie), new Titles, Transitions and Effects, Animated Travel Maps (available in the Effects Room – taken from iMovie), Advanced Particle Effects, Snap to Beat Markers (like iMovie), Multi-Touch Support (for laptop users), etc.","Customisation will also be a key. You’ll be able to design your own tool plugins for the Universal Timeline, which can be bought and sold as an application on the iTunes stores. If you open a project that has a whole lot of plugins you don’t have, then you’ll be given an option to download any of the free ones, or purchase any that aren’t free.","Feel free to send us any comments about our predictions! We’d be really interested to hear what you have to say! But keep in mind, that all of this is just a big GUESS – we don’t have any insider information, nor do we have any connection to anyone at Apple. But after having a good look at Apple’s track record, we think that this is something that has a huge amount of possibility. As we said – only time will tell…","Finally – we have a hunch that Apple will release several hardware addons to FCX. This will speed up renders, and transcodes dramatically. But what makes this hardware so special, is that it’s design and source-code will be released as open source allowing 3rd party developers to take on board this technology. Companies like Blackmagic Design will be able to implement this technology in their own capture cards. They will also release a FCX control surface, that allows you to easily control all the various rooms in the application.","Finally, you have the Finishing Room. This is the were you can export your timeline, clips, effects shots, etc. to web, DVD, AppleTV, iPod, etc. Taking on all the functionality of DVD Studio Pro and iDVD, plus all the power of Compressor – you can export things with one click, or customise the settings to the finest degree. Unfortunately, I suspect BluRay is dead – at least from Apple’s point of view (being a “bad of hurt” and all that!). In this room you’ll also be able to export to tape via a much improved and powerful interface.","However, we don’t think Final Cut Extreme will be designed for the extreme high-end market – we just think that they’ll rename the existing Final Cut Studio package to Final Cut Extreme and keep a similar pricing. It will still be marketed towards their current broad audience – but we also predict, that with a massive new collection of features and simplified workflows, that a lot of the high-end boys and girls will jump on board.","It’s our belief that FCX will focus on tying the professional application in with the rest of the Apple family of products. FCX will play nicely with the Xsan, Xserve, AppleTV, iPhone and iPod. It will have great connectivity with their new online “cloud”.","Next is the Effects Room. After Apple announced the end of Shake, everyone has been eagily waiting for Apple to release the code-named Phenomenon replacement. However, this, so far, has never come about. That said, a lot of the amazing features of Shake have been included in Final Cut, Motion and even iMovie. We believe that the Effects Room will be the Shake replacement. We think that it will utilise a mixture of using the Universal Timeline – but also nodes (like in Shake). You’ll be able to do everything you can currently do in Motion and LiveType – plus utilise all the plugins that Shake has to offer, but the feature set will also be expanded upon. True 3D will be integrated into the package. Using the Media Room, you’ll also easily be able to import effects shots from other packages such as After Effects, and Nuke. The current Final Cut Studio has been very much designed to keep everything in the one package. Getting from Final Cut to After Effects is not a trivial task. However – in FCX, we predict that this will change. Just like MacOS can easily open and manage PDFs, we predict that Apple will try and make everything easier and simplier. Advanced 2D and 3D Trackers, powerful roto tools, etc. will all be stock standard. Masks that are created in the Cutting Room (which you can do using the new and improved pen tool) are automatically available in the Effects Room. Obviously, there will be heaps of amazing templates and “one click” options – all available via the Media Room.","Of course, all of this is great – but we predict that the biggest changes and improvements will be behind the scenes. There will be a change over from the 32-bit Carbon backbone to the 64-bit Cocoa. Everything will be GPU Accelerated. New low bit-rate versions of ProRes will be released. Less things will need rendering (for example, no more rendering if you simply “flip” an clip), and there will be better rendering management (i.e. if you drag a clip over the top of another clip, causing it to need to render, if you drag that clip away again, the old render files will be referenced – no need to re-render). There will be full meta-data support and Spotlight integration. You will be able to have multiple instances of FCX running – as you won’t be able to load multiple projects in the same application like you currently can. Every room will support distributed/cluster rendering as well as background rendering (this includes all plugins). Up to 4:4:4 4K will be supported, plus there will be better support for proxy files. It’s our prediction that FCX will be almost written from the ground up – so the code will be a lot cleaner and more streamlined, making everything more zippy!","People are hoping for better round-tripping support, better media management, unified solid state camera support, major bug-fixes in Color, 10-bit and 4K support, GPU Acceleration, true 3D in Motion, features from Adobe Premiere (such as searchable text), features from Avid (such as script sync), features from iMovie (such as an updated trim editor), background rendering, Spotlight support inside Final Cut… the list goes on, and on!","Project Files will also be quite different to the way they are currently handled in Final Cut. They will be an archive file, which when opened will contain a logical folder structure containing any pre-production information, scripts, etc. Each bin in the Edit Room will be an individual file (much the same as Avid), allowing you to easily copy and paste individual bins if need be.","Regardless of what new and amazing features end up in Final Cut Studio 3, everyone wants to get their hands on it quick smart! Most people seem to think that Apple will showcase their new product somewhere between now and NAB (even though Apple have dropped out of NAB for the foreseeable future).","So how the hell will this actually work? We believe the key is a new Universal Timeline and a set of different Rooms.","So what will make this new FCX so different? Well, it’s our prediction that most of the Final Cut Studio (i.e. Final Cut Pro, Soundtrack Pro, Color, LiveType, etc.) will be merged into the one application. We predict a MASSIVE interface and workflow overhaul. No longer will you need to Send to Soundtrack Pro, or use XML workarounds to get your timeline into Color. Everything will be in the one “box”. In typical Apple style – we predict they’ll make things better, by making them substantially simpler.","So, given all this, what are our predictions?","So, when do we predict this will be released? We have a hunch that Apple will release a minor update to Final Cut Studio within the next couple of months (fixing some of the bugs and adding some new codecs), but will release FCX towards the end of this year along with a new range of MacPro towers. At first, users will be extremely annoyed with Apple for completely re-designing the Final Cut workflow – but soon enough, people will start to realise just how powerful the new application is. As a result, Avid will dramatically reduce their pricing further, and start to offer Media Composer and ProTools as a single package.","Some people are predicating the death of DVD Studio Pro, others are predicting that Blu-ray burning will finally become available. With Apple filing for new patents, some are predicting that Final Cut Studio will introduce some cool new storyboarding features.","The biggest and most important difference will be the Universal Timeline. This timeline will be common across all rooms. It will be very similar to the current timeline, except more powerful. Just imagine if you merged the Final Cut, After Effects, Motion and Soundtrack Pro timelines together. Audio will be vastly improved on the timeline – as you’ll be allowed to perform surround panning, etc. You’ll be able to group tracks, as well as label, colour code them, and even give them a thumbnail icon.","The Cutting Room, will be the Final Cut Pro replacement. Although Final Cut has come a very long way since it was shown in private room demonstrations as a 0.9 alpha at the National Association of Broadcasters exposition in 1998, it’s still not as “Apple” as it could be. Apple products are known for their slick interfaces, and features that “just work” – and although Final Cut is one of the more beautiful interfaces on the market, it’s still got nothing on the really cheap and friendly little brother, iMovie. It’s our prediction that the Cutting Room will have all the fantastic features of the current Final Cut Pro, but with some very major improvements.","The Grading Room will be the place to go for your final colour correction. Much as the same as the Audio Room, any colour correction effects you apply to clips in the Cutting Room will automatically be transferred over to the Grading Room. Based on Color, but with some added functionality from the Shake feature-set, this is were you can do all your grading. Tracking Data and Masks created in the Effects Room (or even the Cutting Room) are all available in the Grading Room.","The Media Room, will be a beefed up version of a mix between the Media Manager in Final Cut, and Final Cut Server. This will be were you keep track of all your video, audio, graphics and other assets. When you create a new Project, you will be asked to select a Media Collection. This will be the equivalent of your Capture Scratch, Thumbnail Cache, etc. In this file (which will be an archive, so you can right click on it and “view archive contents) will be ALL the assets for your project, all nicely organised in a logical folder structure. Each project will have it’s own Media Collection (similar to Avid’s way to dealing with things). If you delete a file from the collection on the Finder level, these changes are automatically detected by FCX (just like in Avid). You can have multiple version of the same file (ie. you might have a couple different versions of a musical score) – and this is all handled by FCX. One of the coolest features will be a video Face Recognition function, much the same as the one found in iMovie. Video clips will also be scanned, and using a new Speech-to-Text engine automatic transcripts will be written (just like in the new version of Premiere).","The name Final Cut Extreme has been around since the lead-up to NAB 2006, after ThinkSecret, writing for PCMagazine, claimed to have additional details about Final Cut Pro 6, Final Cut Extreme, and long-rumoured display upgrades. Final Cut Extreme was said to enable the most demanding users to edit uncompressed 4K and 2540p video. Compatibility was said to include Red Digital Cinema’s Red, Panavision Genesis, Dalsa Origin, Thompson Viper, Sony Cinealta, Phantom HD, and Arri D20 cameras. After this article was released, the online film community went crazy, with heaps of blog posts being written adding to the hype. Unfortunately, the rumours were false, an no Final Cut Extreme was released at NAB 2006. However, in the lead-up to NAB 2007, everything started again. There was the occasional sensible article being written, but most of it was just hype and strong wishing.","The Project Room will be the “hub” of your project. Taking media management to a new extreme, this will be were you can manage different versions of your project, keep track of scripts, storyboards, and other pre-production information. Taking on board features find in other packages such as Celtx, we predict that FCX will have a big focus on ALL stages of the film-making process, including Pre-Production.","The whole selling point of FCX will be making life quicker and easier. In typical Apple style – they’ll take features only found on extremely expensive and high-end products, and make them cool and pretty for trendy Apple users. The integration between FCX, the Internet, AppleTV and iPhones will be extremely important to the success of the product.","There has been a lot of discussion on the Internet the last few months in regards to what Apple is going to do with the seemingly out-dated Final Cut Studio package. Lots of people have written blog articles about what features they would like to see in the new versions of Final Cut Pro, Soundtrack Pro, Color, etc. The general consensus from the Internet community seems to be that Final Cut Studio is due for a very major update, or even a complete overhaul. Conversations about this are appearing wide-spread on podcasts, twitter, forums and through all the major social networks.","There will also be heaps of little extra bug fixes and improvements, such as improved speed tools in the Cutting Room, better cutting and pasting of parameters, better and more interactive bins (you’ll be able to make your clips any size, and re-arrange them any way you want). The ability to “click and drag” to enable/disable or lock/unlock tracks, or check/uncheck filters (like various Adobe applications). One of the biggest improvements will be better error explanation (i.e. instead of “General Error”, FCX will explain exactly what went wrong and suggest ways of fixing it).","Unfortunately, we still predict that FCX will be heavily based around the Quicktime Architecture, meaning that you’ll still probably have to wrap R3D files into Quicktime files. However, this process will be all done in the background. For example, if you drag a MXF file into the timeline, this file is automatically copied, logged and transcoded or wrapped to the Media Collection in the background. You can still do other things while FCX is adding new media (similar to the way Final Cut Pro handles it’s new stabilisation features).","User Management will be dramatically improved in FCX. Much like in Avid, you will be able to easily create and switch between user profiles when the application first loads, and also any time whilst you have the application running. You can easily customise the FCX interface to suit your own needs. Currently, managing user customisations in Final Cut Pro is a joke. Multiple users working on the same project will also be supported. Changes will be tracked and logged.","We predict that as an extension to their current MobileMe platform, they will release MobileMe Pro, which will easily allow you to share pre-production documents such as scripts and call sheets, as well as offer everything that Final Cut Server currently has to offer. You’ll be able to easily export rough cuts out of FCX, that will automatically be uploaded to the MobileMe platform, and then producers can access these videos on their iPhone.","We predict that the package will be AUD$1000.00, and you will not be able to upgrade to it from Final Cut Studio 2.","Well, we think sometime this year Apple will release Final Cut Extreme– a complete overhaul of the Final Cut Studio package.","Will we be right? Only time will tell! Like most people, we do honestly believe that Apple is due for a major update – especially after we’ve just started using Avid for a couple of projects, and have realised just how fantastic the backbone behind Avid is (just the way it handles user profiles and project files is great). But we have “grown up” with Final Cut (in fact, that only reason we went to Apple was due to it!), so we do really want to support it. It will certainly be interesting to see what actually happens in the next few months (especially considering the state of the world’s finances). I don’t know how many people in the world are quite ready to spend a lot of money on new software…"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"oh-look-its-2009","l":"Oh, look… It’s 2009!","p":["One minute it’s Christmas, then zap! Next minute, January is nearly over. How times flies! Hello everyone, and welcome to our very first entry for the new year – even if it is slightly late. I hope you all have a fantastic holiday break, and a terrific New Years Eve! And, if you’re in Australia – I hope you’re enjoying the ridiculously hot weather! Although we personally do love the sun and the beach – when you’ve got a week with temperatures on and above 40 degrees Celsius, things start to get a little bit scary, as the Sakooz headquarters is in the middle of the Dandenong Ranges (i.e. a forest). But as terrifying as it is, it also forces you to think about something very important – backups. What would you do if the worst happens, and your studio burns down? Do you have your camera originals off-site? Do you have backups of all your past and current projects? How quickly can you “recover” from a disaster? There are also scary, but terribly important questions we’ve been asking ourselves over the past couple of weeks. Although it’s probably not the most ideal way of handling things, we currently have a box which we call “the mobile vault”. The vault contains all our original camera tapes (MiniDV, DVCPro50, DVCProHD, etc.), DVD backups of Final Cut Project Files, printed copies of EDLs, Hard Drive’s containing project backups, an equipment inventory, copies of important documents (i.e. CVs), etc. The vault is always kept as the safest possible location – normally the grandparents, as they’re generally always home. In a perfect world, it would be great to have LTO tapes containing all this material instead of cheap hard drives and DVDs, and also to have multiple vaults, just to be extra safe. But unfortunately all these things cost money, and at the end of the day, as long as we don’t loose any “current projects” (i.e. project we’re currently working on), life will go on. Although it’s great to have the original project files of past projects – the chances of going back to them are fairly slim. So anyway… just something to keep in mind. If you are in a bush fire area, make sure you have a good strategy in place in case disaster attacks.","On a happier note – 2009 is already looking very exciting! We have been working around the clock on the Sakooz website, and everything seems to be falling into place. If all goes to plan, we should be able to go live some time in February. In other Sakooz news, we are still negotiating away with various high-profile people in regards to getting someone on board to write the feature film script. We also have a lot of other projects in the pipeline for this year, as well as a few more unique projects. Over the next couple of weeks, we’ll be fixing up the website a bit, putting more energy into our Facebook presence, and also jumping fully on board the twitter bandwagon. This year is set to be the year of “new media” – so we are definitely keeping our ear to the ground, and eyes to the sky on the lookout for new treads, technology and, well, basically just cool stuff. We’ll continue to improve upon Melbourne Rebels, and also try and come up with other ways to help Melbourne-based film-makers get their ideas off the ground. This year is all about innovation and experimentation for us. We’ll be trying and testing new things, developing as much new content as we possibly can – and maybe even consider jumping into the wonderful world of professional podcasts.","So, as always, exciting times certainly lay ahead – as we have very big plans for this year. Keep an eye out on this blog, keeping visiting our website and Facebook Group, follow our twitter, and keep in touch! If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or ideas, please, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us – especially when it’s about projects such as Melbourne Rebels. We love your input!","Until next time…","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"happy-festivus--thanks-for-all-the-fish","l":"Happy Festivus & Thanks for All the Fish!","p":["It’s amazing to think that Christmas Day has already been and gone.

Your continued assistance and support will certainly will not be forgotten!","On another note, originally we were planning to release Sakooz to the Internet community on the first day of 2009. However, we have since decided against this for a couple of reasons. The main reason for the delay is that we want to get the “trailer remix” function (a website which allows you to edit together your very own version of the Sakooz trailer and share it with the world) up-and-running from the very get-go. When we release the Sakooz trailer to the world, we want it to land with a bang – so as much as we’re so eager and excited to let it out of its cage, we need to contain ourselves, take a deep breathe, and release it at the RIGHT time, with everything ready to go. So for those that haven’t seen it yet – unfortunately you’re going to have to wait just a little bit longer.","Well… that’s all for now. Again, a MASSIVE thank you to EVERYONE that has supported us in 2008! We certainly can’t wait to see what fun and adventures lies for 2009… Exciting times certainly lay ahead!","Merry Christmas!

Have a great holiday break and we’ll catch you again in 2009!","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Post Production Workflow","p":["…and the other babies:","After principle photography was wrapped we set the MacPro to work trancoding the R3D files using REDrushes (a free application which can be downloaded from the RED site). We were transcoding the R3D files to Apple ProRes 422 HQ files at 1920×1080. We were using the full debayer quality, and REDSpace for both the Colour & Gamma spaces. This took a HUGE amount of time (almost two weeks of none stop processing), but at the end of the day we ended up with some terrific Quicktime files that we could throw into Final Cut Pro and start editing, plus we could also send these clips to the visual effects kids so that they could start playing. We did run into one slight problem after we THOUGHT that everything was done. On inspection of the transcoded files, we realised that all the Quicktimes for Day Two of shooting were EXACTLY the same as Day Four. I’m still not sure whether that was human error or REDrushes being annoying – but either way we had to re-transcode all of the day four footage. Unfortunately at this stage we had to give back the MacPro, so we had to do all of this on a stock standard first generation MacBook. It wasn’t quite as fast as the MacPro, but it got the job done. Eventually.","Although in the end we didn’t end up using any of the sync audio – we recorded audio separately to a Sound Devices 744T, which was synced to a Smart Slate. Originally we had planned to sync the camera to the 744T as well, but for some reason we couldn’t get it to work on the first day of shooting, so we gave up. I believe the problem has since been fixed with one of the RED ONE Firmware Updates. We only had one microphone on set – a Sennheiser 416 on a boom. We basically just recorded sound to use as a guide track for when it came to adding sound effects later on.","Although the plan was always to shoot to card for safety reasons (we’ve all got disaster stories to tell about Firestore’s dying and hard drives being dropped!) – we decided to gamble and record straight to the RED-DRIVE (a special drive designed for the camera which can store 320GB in a RAID 0 configuration). Not only that – but we decided to leave the dumping to the end of the day. This was a HUGE risk, because if the drive died at the end of the day, we’d potentially loose a whole days worth of shooting. However, we didn’t have the crew available to have a dedicated “data technician”, nor did we have the hardware to dump the cards on a regular basis. This may seem really silly (I mean seriously – all you need is a Mac laptop and a card reader!), but we had neither of those things at the time, and it was just easier to use what we had available. Luckily – nothing went wrong, and the RED-DRIVE was faultless – it never dropped a single frame! However, to anyone else planning to shoot on RED – I strongly recommend you do the complete opposite to what we did! Record to CF card and dump as soon as the card is full.","And that is the workflow we decided to use for Sakooz! At the moment we are just archiving all the project files to DVD, and keeping all the media on the SATAII drives. At some stage we will eventually put everything to LTO drives as a final backup – but we don’t have the money at the moment.","At the end of each shooting day we dumped the RED-DRIVE and the 744T to two seperate 1TB SATAII drives. For the duration of the shoot we managed to borrow a brand new MacPro Tower from Julian at Eidolon Creative and used this machine to do all the dumping as well as the transcoding. We put the two 1TB drives directly into the MacPro. We ended up with 508.34GB of camera footage, and a couple of GB of audio. We ended up purchasing two additional 500GB SATAII drives to make another backup of all of the R3D files – which we then stored at two separate locations away from our master edit suite, just in case. We called the drives Pinky (Master Edit), Bluey (Backup of Master Edit), Tumbles (R3D Master) and Splash (backup of R3D Master), because that’s what the names of the Sakooz creatures are called. Anyway… Now normally, on a “proper” production, you would have RAIDs and RAID 5 protection, etc. But unfortunately, we simply didn’t have the money for that, so we just had to make do with what we had. We had to manually copy and paste the files for backup purposes – we basically did this at the end of each day. We also kept a copy of the Final Cut Pro project on two USB thumbdrives just in case. Just for laughs, here’s a photo of some of the drives from our rather odd-ball collection. The top right one is Pinky. We ended up taking the covers off the enclosures as we found they got too hot when in use all day and night long.","By printing off the EDL we now had a hard copy of the trailer’s edit – which is always a good thing! But more importantly, it allowed us to easily track and manage everything. Because we couldn’t afford to purchase software such as Crimson Workflow, and we didn’t have time to write up our own proprietary software, we ended up doing a lot of things manually. For instance, we ended up going down the EDL line by line, and exporting a 1920×1080 DPX sequence from REDCINE. We made minor adjustments in REDCINE to get the most clean image and exported away. We put each shot in a different folder based on the EDL number assigned to the shot. For example, the first shot in the trailer was called 001_000001.DPX. This kept things nice and simple. Once every shot was exported out of REDCINE as DPX sequence (which took a night), it was ready for grading!","Chris!","From that Quicktime master we than could do any DVD, web, Blu-ray, etc. encodes using Compressor.","I’m not even sure how this is possible, but we were able to play one video track of 1920×1080 ProRes on the eMac over Firewire 400 in realtime without any issues. And so, we basically edited away for several weeks in Final Cut Pro 6. We ended up doing a very rough grade using the 3-way Colour Corrector just so that when we showed other people to get opinions, they were looking at something that looked half decent. We tried a huge amount of different things in terms of the edit – we used a lot of different music as guide tracks. We even copied the audio from other big Hollywood trailers (such as the Dark Knight) and cut our footage to their soundtrack just to see what we could come up with. It was a very painful, long, but fun and creative process that I certainly won’t forget any time soon!","If you have any questions about the workflow or how we did anything, feel free to post a comment. At some stage in the future we also hope to post some more detailed information on the various visual effects that featured in the trailer, so stay tuned!","In terms of Principle Photography, everything pretty much ran exactly the same as if we were shooting on film. We lit it exactly the same way, and Ben (our DOP) still had his light meter by his side. Because we needed to shoot so much very quickly (time wasn’t on our side), I decided against setting up a “video village” and even a directors monitor – preferring to be there in the action, behind Ben, peaking over his shoulder to watch the on-camera LCD. This worked really well.","Now with a whole heap of beautifully graded DPX sequences, it was time to do the online. I ended up doing this at University on a nice and speedy MacPro in After Effects CS3. I imported all of the DPX sequences, and then manually put them all in the correct places based on the printed EDL. Once that was complete I simply rendered out a Quicktime File using the Animation Codec. Here is a photo taken at about four o’clock in the morning after I’d been at uni for about fourty hours STRAIGHT working on Sakooz. You can see the insanity in my eyes.","Offlining using such high quality media may seem a little silly – I mean, really, we could have done a quarter res transcode to DV, and save a huge amount of time and disk space. Also, considering we were doing the offline on a bunch of eMac’s over Firewire 400 drives (that’s right… really old school eMac’s!), it would have also made the whole editing process a lot more fluid. However! By editing at such a great quality, it meant that whenever we did test screenings or had to show potential investors or sponsors, we could easily burn off a high-quality 1920×1080 Quicktime Movie that looks simply gorgeous even before grading. Here is a photo of our main editing machine.","Once the offline edit was complete, we tidied up the timeline so that everything was on the one track (where possible) and printed off an EDL. This then became our bible. At this stage, all the audio had been done in Final Cut Pro, with the occasional effect being done in Protools LE and Soundtrack Pro, and then exported out as an AIFF. We were still using guide track music.","Originally we had planned to do the grade at one of the major post houses in Melbourne, but due to a lack of time and money, we ended up getting a very talented film school graduate called Nick Reid to do the grade in Apple’s Color. Getting the DPX files into Color proved to be a bit more tricky than anticipated! We ended up purchasing yet another 1TB SATAII drive (called Gizmo) for the colour grade.","The only thing left to do was sound! Once Frank (our composer) finished, he simply gave us a 24-Bit 48KHz Broadcast Wave File, which we threw into Final Cut Pro. After a bit of tweaking – adjusting the sound effect levels to suit the new score, the sound was ready to rock and roll! Originally we had planned to do a quite complex 5.1 mix just for fun – but at the end of the day, no one was ever going to listen to it in surround sound anyway, so we decided to skip on that idea (for now at least). Once the sound was done, we exported an AIFF and then merged the Animation Codec video and AIFF together to create the Final Quicktime Master!","This wasn’t exactly the quickest workflow in the world (we did a lot of things manually that could have been easily avoided by using software such as Crimson Workflow, plus we used extremely old Mac’s and PC’s in a lot of cases), but a lot of it came down to money vs time. In some cases money won out, but more often than not, we decided to save money and do things the manual way. To be perfectly honest, it actually felt really nice to have a printed out EDL on which to direct everything! It felt much the same as the good old days with film!","We ended up with 16 visual effects in total (including graphics). Once a visual effect shot was completed it was exported as a 1920×1080 DPX sequence ready for grading. For your viewing pleasure, here are some photos of After Effects genius James Otter, working away! I have no idea what the cardboard cartons are for, or where he got them. Needless to say, these photos were taken at some ridiculous early hour of the morning, after James and I had been stuck at uni for AT LEAST forty hours STRAIGHT!","What we ended up doing was wrapping all the DPX files as Quicktimes manually using AJA’s free DPXtoQTTranslator utility. Once all of the DPX’s were wrapped (including all the visual effects), we manually re-created the Final Cut Pro timeline based on the printed EDL using the newly wrapped Quicktime files. We then exported out a XML file from Final Cut Pro. This XML file was brought into Color and grading could commence. Nick took a couple of days to do the grade, and once completed, he handed back Gizmo, ready for the final stages!","When we first started thinking about the best way to put together the Sakooz trailer, we originally thought that Super 16mm and a film scan route would be the most appropriate option given our budget, and the “Hollywood trailer” look that we were after. However, after various camera tests (we’ll post some further information on these tests another time), and a bit of number crunching, it became clear pretty quickly that shooting on the RED ONE was going to achieve better results, cost less and make the post production just that little bit easier (at least in theory) by keeping everything digital. And so, after getting in touch with Cail & Pete from Inspiration Studios, and doing some tests with their brand new toy camera – we decided to shoot the Sakooz trailer on RED.","Whilst I was trying to lock down the picture, others were playing around with the visual effects. Initially, tests and trials were done by the various VFX artists using the ProRes Quicktime files. However, once we had locked down the trailer in terms of the edit, we used REDCINE to export out 4K TIFF sequences and 2K/1K DPX sequences for the visual effects people to work on. Ashley Smart (who did the effects for the Shed Explosion Sequence) was using 4K TIFF Sequences in After Effects on a laptop (which is quite incredible). James Otter used 1K DPX sequences in Nuke, and After Effects to achieve a lot of the effects shots, on a PC. And I used a good old MacBook, running After Effects and Shake to do the remaining shots. I ended up using After Effect’s own tracker for most of the tracking work, although I did use PFTrack for one of the shots. I also used Syntheyes on an old Dell Laptop for a small section of another shot. For Pinky eyes, I ended up brining in 4K DPX sequences into After Effects – which was fairly interesting on the poor old MacBook! But it worked, and the shots came out OK considering…","With the grade now completed, we exported out AJA 10-bit Uncompressed RGB Quicktimes. We then used the AJA QTtoDPXTranslator to unwrap the Quicktime Files back to DPX files. As the AJA tool simply “wraps” the files – it doesn’t transcode them or anything like that, this process is really fast, although you do have to do it manually. For me, that means I have to do everything 69 times which isn’t too bad. The only annoying thing is that you have to rename all the clips again, as Color names everything sequentially, and we wanted everything named as per the bible (i.e. the EDL)."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"first-public-screenings","l":"First Public Screenings!","p":["Once again time has gotten away from me – so this news is a bit old now! But, hey – better late than never! The Sakooz trailer had it’s first official public screening on Tuesday 2nd of December 2008 at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, Australia as part of the Swinburne University Graduation Screening Program. And from all reports… everyone seemed to love it! It was a fantastic night, with so many quality films on show (12 student works in total – ranging from short films, to TV pilots, sketch comedies, etc.). Congratulations to all of the students who got to show their films at the screening, and thanks to everyone involved for putting together the event (especially James Verdon)!","To be perfectly honest, I was as nervous as all hell in the lead up to the screening. A lot of the cast and crew attending the screening hadn’t seen the trailer at this point, so I had no idea what the reaction was going to be. But luckily, no bricks have gone through my window, and everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy the trailer. The general consensus seemed to be: “I loved it! It looked so cool! I really want to see the full feature! Oh, but I had no idea what it’s about”! Now, I’m not sure if that’s a problem or not. Right throughout the editing process it’s been a constant battle between “telling too much” and “not enough” when it comes to story telling in the trailer. The fact that we don’t yet had a locked down feature film script doesn’t help – but at the same time, trailers are meant to “sell a concept”, not just give away the whole plot. The fact that people seemed to really get excited about the whole idea is great – regardless of whether or not they knew what was going on. One of the best thing about listening in to other people’s conversations after the screening was hearing people arguing with one another about what it was actually about. Everyone seems to “read” the trailer differently, and come up with a whole of unique and intriguing meanings and metaphors. But the best thing of all is, that once both parties eventually give up arguing about what the film is actually about, they just agree to disagree, and say, “I guess we’ll just have to watch the feature film to find out”! Now, this is exciting! If people actually want to watch the feature film, then we’re onto something! Oh, and the fact that the audience clapped twice after the trailer is always a good sign (especially as none of the other films recieved the double clap!).","It was fantastic to see the trailer shown in a theatrical environment at such a great cinema! ACMI has to be one of my favourite cinema’s in Melbourne, simply because the visual and audio quality is faultless, the seats and comfortable, and it’s in such a great location. The trailer was shown in HD, via a HDCAM deck, so it looked and sounded amazing! One of the biggest things I noticed was how much faster it seemed being shown on such a big screen. Having watched it a billion or so times on a 17″ monitor, and a few times on various small scale projection screens, it seemed to run so much quicker on the bigger screen – which is actually great! It seemed so Hollywood – so action packed. Even I got excited watching it!","Sakooz made it’s second public screening at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, for another Swinburne event on the 4th of December. Unfortunately, the actual screening itself was fairly horrible, as the 12 students films were just played on a looping DVD player in a small section of ACCA, on a crappy little cheap projector with an incredibly bad sound system. It certainly wasn’t the best viewing enviroment to see the trailer, but even so, when Sakooz did play it certainly got a big reaction! As a lot of the other films were dialogue driven, as no one in the audience could really hear what was going on (due to the bad sound system, but also the huge amount of people in the venue chatting away, drinking and socialising), when Sakooz popped up, I think everyone was pleasantly shocked to see a piece that was purely driven by visuals. So once again, Sakooz made a reaction, which is what it’s all about!","So what’s been happening since ACCA? In terms of Sakooz, nothing really noteworthy. To perfectly honest, after several months of hell, I just needed a little bit of a break – not that I’ve been resting! I’ve been attending a lot of the other film school screenings the last few weeks (Holmesglen, VCA, RMIT, etc.) to “check out the competition” and see what other amazing up-and-coming talents are out there. As always with these kinds of screenings, there was some really great stuff, and also some really average stuff. To be perfectly honest, and I know this is going to sound biased, but I really feel like the Swinburne University screening was by far the strongest this year overall. VCA’s work was brillant as always, but there was a lot of films that seemed quite pretentious and “out there for the sake of it”, and I was also quite shocked that not all of the films were as technically perfect as they should have been. Normally everything out of the VCA is technically spotless (i.e. perfect sound – no nasty pops or clicks, no visual artefacts, etc.), but this year there were a couple of films that obviously missed quality control. That said, a couple of the films were terrific (for those that went, I really loved the opening film on Screening A about the boxes, as well as the film starring the killer wombat!). The Holmesglen screening had some really great films on display – but it also had a lot of average content. To be honest, the majority of the films seemed really amateur – almost verging on “home movie” quality. What was most surprising however was the 3D animations. I was expecting to see some really great stuff – but with the exception of two little shorts (one involving cups, the other involving a mime artist), the overall quality was fairly poor. But, as I said, with all these kinds of screenings, you had the good, and you have the bad. The scary thing is however, I can’t believe how many new film graduates are going to be trying to get a job next year. If you add up the enrolments from all of the various film schools in Melbourne – well, you get a lot of people all looking for employment.","So what’s in store for the near future? I am currently still trying to work out a plan of attack for the Sakooz feature film concept. I had a lot of ideas in the pipeline, and a few people that might be interested in getting on board the Sakooz freight train to help it get made. We are planning to release the trailer to the world on the 1st of January 2009 – although with everything else we do with Sakooz, this is subject to change. At this stage, we’re considering releasing the trailer through YouTube first, simply because it’s got such a good community, and word tends to spread fast between users. Obviously however, this brings up a lot of copyright issues, which we are currently considering. But rest assured, we’re certainly not sleeping – and Sakooz is very much an “alive and kicking” project! We’re also hoping to get some behind the scenes footage, and also some more information on our workflow, etc. onto this blog as soon as possible.","As always, exciting times certainly lay ahead! Onward and upward!","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"done--done","l":"Done & Done!","p":["You won’t believe it – or at least, I certainly don’t! I think the trailer is actually finished. Actually scrap that – the trailer is finished! For now anyway! After many, many months of hard work, with so many ups, and so many downs, today the Sakooz trailer was officially printed onto the DVCProHD tape destined for the ACMI Screening on the 2nd of December. For those that live in Melbourne, you should definitely come along! Frank Strangio, our incredible and unstoppable composer battled illness and an ever jam-packed schedule to not only fit in the time to put together a three minute score for the trailer, but create a score that is pure gold. Despite the fact that we didn’t have any money to afford “real” instruments, the score sounds so big, so epic and just so heart felt and moving. As you can tell – I’m very happy with the end result! For anyone looking for an absolutely INCREDIBLE composer, who is also just the most lovely guy you’ll ever meet – check out Frank’s site. You can also see his huge list of credits on IMDB.","What an adventure it’s been! I never thought that post production would be as exciting, dangerous and challenging as the principle photography, but hey, you learn something new every day! I can’t tell you how glad I am to finally be able to file away all those printed EDLs, editing notes, colour grading notes, and stop thinking about DPX sequences and colour sampling! In fact, I just can’t wait to finally get some sleep! It’s been a long time coming!","So what now? Well, to be perfectly honest, I haven’t thought too much about it! I’m just glad we got through today, and everything is ready for the ACMI screening! So I guess first up on the agenda is ACMI. This will be the first semi-public screening of the trailer – so if you want to get a glimpse before the masses, I strongly suggest you come along! Then after that, we begin our big marketing campaign! Originally I had planned to launch this directly after the ACMI screening – however, I’ve since decided to push things back until either later in December or the first week of Janurary, just so that I have a little bit more time to get things organised. Oh dear! Despite the fact that I’m in DESPERATE need of a holiday, December is going to be once again a busy month it seems – website to make, DVDs to produce, meetings to organise, the list goes on! Well, at least live isn’t boring!","It’s going to be so interesting to see what reaction the trailer gets. To be honest, most people that have seen the trailer so far (before it was completely finished), have said, “Wow! It’s cool. It looks amazing! But I have absolutely no idea what its about”. Fair enough! But to be honest, I’m not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. I think I’ll have a better idea if I’ve made any horrible mistakes in the aftermath of the ACMI screening. As always, time will tell!","So once again, thank you to EVERYONE who has supported me over the last year and a bit! It’s been an AMAZING ride! I hope once you see the trailer you think it was worth the battle. Personally – I think it certainly was. I’ll be posting more over the next couple of days, and a heap more in December about the post production process and how we went about things.

The day we finish the Sakooz trailer is the day that RED and Apple release a software update that would have made my life so much easier. This update is BIG news for anyone who has to deal with RED footage on a Final Cut Pro system, as it now means you can edit R3D files natively on Final Cut Pro (in much the same way as you would edit DVCPRO HD footage coming from something like a HVX). This software is literally hot off the press, so there is bound to be bugs and issues, but from most (actually scrap that… SOME) reports, everything seems to be working as planned. For our trailer, what we ended up doing was bringing in 1920×1080 DPX Sequences into Color – now you can just “Send To” from Final Cut, and the native REDCODE timeline is re-created in Color.

The biggest worry we have currently is whether or not we’ll have the score completed by then. But fingers crossed!

One minute it’s September, and the next it’s all of a sudden October. It’s certainly been an incredible year and it’s rapidly disappearing. So what’s been happening since my last post – well, like always, lots! This week we successfully locked down the picture edit. It certainly wasn’t easy, and our Final Cut Pro project file has so many different edits and versions within it, it’s ridiculous, but we made it in the end! But, even though this is a big step in the right direction, there is still a very long way to go, and we don’t have much time to do it all. The musical score is under way, as are the many visual effects – but even after we complete these things, we still need to do the final colour grade, the sound design, edit and mastering, plus get the final product onto all the various media and formats for distribution. Although we’re not in a bad position, we’ve basically got three or so weeks to wrap everything up, so the pressure is definitely on! So with that said, I’ve got to get back to work. Eventually (probably next month in all honestly), we will get around to uploading all the things we’ve been promising for months, like some more production stills, video blogs, camera tests, etc. But in the meantime, here are some happy snaps from a recent green screen shoot for the Sakooz trailer. We had to shoot some character pick-ups for some of the visual effects. To save money, we only build one alien character (Pinky), but for the purposes of the trailer, we’re shooting some material of the Pinky character against a green screen, then grading the costume to a different character (i.e. blue) and then digitally inserting the shots into the scenes, so that there’s more than one creature. Because the additional character only appear very small in frame, we can shoot these elements on a HVX202 (as opposed to a RED, which we used for principle photography). We also used a different cast and crew for these pick-ups. A big thank you to Julia for jumping in the costume!

We’ve gone through a few drafts now, and are still experimenting trying to put together a trailer that explains the story (but doesn’t give everything away), introduces the characters, looks and sounds amazing, and isn’t boring or clichéd. It’s not an easy task, as we’re limited to what we shot on our very hectic five day shooting schedule – but it’s a lot of fun just messing around with the edit and trying new things. One of the big problems I’m finding so far is putting together a sequence that won’t confuse the audience too much – because I know the story so well, it’s easy to forget what the audience do and don’t know. Also, a lot of things that looked good on paper, simply don’t translate through to the screen – so it’s a challenge thinking outside of the box, and messing around with the edit to give certain shots new meaning and context.","I’m off to Sydney tomorrow for a few days for work (so that I can pay off some of my Sakooz debts!), but when I return it will be full steam ahead again in the edit suite.

Although I had an AMAZING response, and lots of people really wanted to help out (especially as many of them hadn’t had a chance to cut together RED footage yet), no one was willing to sign up given the deadlines. And so, after many discussion with various editors and mentors, I have decided to cut together the rough cut myself, and then get advice from various people to complete the edit. So yes, I guess I’m also going to have to add “editor” to my credit list. Luckily however, because the footage just looks so good (and I really love what footage we ended up with) – it’s quite fun to cut together.

One of the main problems I had at this stage was that due to various reasons I no longer had access to the animatronic Pinky head.

We were ready to rock and roll…","Ok… so I decided that the trailer must go ahead on the Wednesday night. That meant I had six days until day one of principle photography. Had everyone still been on the project, that deadline would have been a challenge but not impossible. Given that I was now producing, directing and art directing, this was going to be one of the toughest tasks I’d ever undertaken, but hey, I was up for it!","On the way, we grabbed an old JAG from work (thanks Frank!), and off Jacqui and I went back home to prepare for day one. At home, we started sorting through all the gear, and loading it all into a massive trailer.","Once home I unloaded everything (which was surprisingly easier than trying to get it into the van in the first place), and then dropped the van back off at work. It was now very late, but I continued on working out schedules and attempted to nail and glue back the spaceship set together. At about 4:30 in the morning I finally got around to writing an e-mail to all the cast letting them know the situation. Some of them knew already – as I had spoken to them soon after I found out that Isaac, Anli & Caithlin will no longer be continuing on – but others had no idea. It was a very tough e-mail to write – as I didn’t really know what to say. I didn’t want to scare them away from the production (as loosing the director is quite a big thing!), but at the same time, I wanted to ensure them that I was more than up for the challenge and still really believed in the concept and the belief that this could be big.","Photos and behind the scenes footage will start appearing soon, so stay tuned!","Saturday was a big day. Luckily I convinced some of my brothers friends at the party to come and help me complete the spaceship. And so, with a team of talented people, we started work. Four of us took on the spaceship outside, whilst inside my brother started cutting up foam and fabric to build Pinky’s head. It really was a race against time. I wish I had some behind the scenes footage of us building everything outside, as it would be been seriously funny. None of us were really builders (although Karen at least knew how to operate all the scary power tools!), so we were just pretty much making it up as we went along. It was fun – a little scary at times (whenever I had the jigsaw in hand!) – but certainly not a boring afternoon! By the end of the day, we had made amazing progress. Outside, the ship was starting to look as if it would actually work, and inside, Pinky’s head was slowly coming to life. Thank you to Catherine, Karen, Shaun, David, Jacqui and the rest of my supportive family for all of your help! I got about one hour sleep that night, and just my luck, during that one hour of turning my back, it started snowing!","So that pretty much wraps up this entry! In the next few entries we’ll give you a run down of what happened during the shoot – as we certainly had some exciting times!","So, we continued building in the freezing cold with snow all around us, whilst inside the nice and warm house, David continued on with Pinky’s head. Once I had done all I could do outside, I spent the rest of the day in front of the computer doing call sheets. By Sunday night everything was looking good – call sheets were done, the space ship was ready for transportation, and Pinky’s head was done except for the eyes. We hoped that we could get the eyes from the animatronics version of Pinky, but failing that we ended up just making a new pair. They’re very similar, however, not quite as good. But luckily, you can’t really notice the difference on camera.","The morning was dedicated to working out a basic plan of attack. Given that my work load has now tripled, I had to do some seriously thinking and evaluating. There was a lot of work still to be done, so I started hunting down people I could trust to pull it off given the tight deadline. Once I had a very rough plan of attack, I then headed to Animal & Odd-bod Creators to pick up the Pinky body. I must say, Colleen, Karen and everyone at this company has gone well and truly out of their way to help us out. They have been so tremendously helpful, supportive and flexible, it’s been amazing. So thank you! The Pinky body was perfect, and so off I went, with a Pink alien body on the passenger seat. The adventure continues!","Then in the afternoon I had to pick up a work van and pick up all the props, sets and other odd-ball stuff that was still at Isaac’s. This was a very strange moment – almost an ending of an era. Isaac, Caithlin and Anli were all there, and together as a team we tried to get the uncompleted space ship set into the van. Thanks to our good mate Murphy (who seems to be following me around like a stalker), the ship was about 1.5cm too big to fit into the van (“missed it by that much!”). And so, we got some hammer out, and in a typical Chris fashion, we just “bashed” it in. After a good forty minutes of near death experiences, and some serious struggles trying to get everything into the now completely jam packed van, we won – and we went for coffee to have a debrief. To be perfectly honest, it was horribly awkward. I guess this was the point of separation. Anli, Caithlin and Isaac were heading off to work on something completely new and different, and I was continuing on where we all left off. There was no yelling or screaming – and everyone looked, although very sad, fairly relieved. And so, after I had one of the most hardcore Hot Chocolates I’ve ever had (it was like drinking a block of pure chocolate that had been turned into liquid form by a bunch of high precision lasers), we all said our goodbyes and headed off in different direction. Anli went off on a train, Caithlin jumped in a car, Isaac walked home, and I drove back home in a jam packed van. But I made it!","Then Monday, the day before shooting, it was a MASSIVE day of picking up and testing gear! First up we picked up all the uni gear (which was a completely full 4WD load – actually I’m pretty sure we seriously overloaded the car but anyway). Then we headed home, unloaded, and headed back out to pick up the camera from Inspiration Studios. As always Cail and Pete were AMAZINGLY helpful and supportive. These guys are the RED gurus – so if you ever need to hire a RED in Melbourne, give them a call. They really go above and beyond! Then it was off to Frazier Film Lighting to grab some more lighting. Les is amazing, and we are so grateful for all of his assistance and support. Like everyone else, he really went out of his way to help us out. So thank you!","Unfortunately that night I didn’t get much sleep either. We just had so much to do. But, despite all odds, we got there. We were ready for day one. Despite all the obstacles, despite all the problems, we had at least got to this stage.","Until next time… Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"it-only-gets-worse-before-it-gets-better","l":"It only gets worse before it gets better…","p":["And so, Anli, Isaac and myself started rebuilding the story, character and plot outline. We started to question everything, and ask ourselves and each other heaps of questions. What would Leodore do in this situation? Why would he do it? We did pages and pages of character notes and questionnaires. If we couldn’t answer a question, we sit down as a group and run around in circles until one of us had a brainwave and everything fell into place. The process was hard work – it took a hell of a lot out of you, but it was (in my opinion at least), worth it. Not only were we creating a story that was beginning to have some kind of a backbone – but we were also learning just how hard it is to create a complex story from the ground up. I’ve read a million times just how hard the writing process is, and how much pain writers go through – but until you do it yourself, you just have no idea. Like most things, when you sit down staring at a blank screen, it all seems almost impossible. How can you possibly fill all these pages with magical words? But once you start getting into the swing of things, slowly by surely, everything starts falling into place. Of course, what you write the first time won’t be perfect – you’ll no doubt need to stop, go back, and re-write what you wrote (and probably took you three days to write!), but that’s all part of the process. It’s hard work – but someone has to do it! Flash forward to the 26th of April, and that’s when we started this blog!","And so, I had shut myself into a thoughtless capsule, in the daytime blind to the negative elements of the film of which there were so very many. I didn’t have the balls to try to escape, my thoughts were along the lines of “just finish this piece of shit and move on”. Luckily because of sickness the other creative Anli had time to herself to think clearly, she managed to rack up the courage to make the harder decision to leave while we were weakly continuing on.","And so, the start of the real adventure continued! The first step was going to be tough – real tough. I had to call up Isaac and Caithlin and explain to them, that despite everything that happened today, I had decided to take on everything myself. Isaac wasn’t impressed. It had been an incredibly tough decision for us all to throw in the towel, and he didn’t appreciate my sudden change of heart. But in my defence, at the time I didn’t really have much of an option. It was two against one, and I didn’t think I could even remotely possibly think I could do everything myself. What I didn’t realise at the time was that I wouldn’t be doing it all by myself. I would just be the “ringleader” – my fantastic cast and crew would be the one’s that would help ensure that everything goes to plan. Although neither Caithlin or Isaac liked it – they didn’t really have a choice in the matter. If I wanted to go ahead, then that was my choice. They both warned me that it was going to be hell and that I would probably end up with something that was just plain “crap” – but that didn’t really bother me. At least I’d give it my very best shot. And at the end of the day, I believed in the concept. I believed in the story. In fact, I loved the story and the characters. After all, despite the fact that Isaac, Anli and myself developed the Sakooz story as a team – at the end of the day, I felt as if it was always my story. I had worked on the Tweenies over a period of four years (I first travelled around Australia as a minder and animatronics assistant at the extremely young age of 15). It was a MASSIVE part of my life, and the experience really made me the person that I am today (for better or for worse!). Although Leodore was a fictional character, there are so many elements of him I can relate to (which is kind of scary).","And with that one short e-mail, everything started to very slowly fall apart. As soon as I read that e-mail, my mind went into overdrive. Anli deciding to leave the production was obviously a massive shock, and a big reality check. She had obviously lost complete and utter faith in the production, and more importantly, she had lost faith in the concept and the story. This was a big problem – but what scared me most of all was what Caithlin and Isaac would think. Having already lost Dave (our ex-Production Manager) earlier in the year, and now Anli, was this the end of what was heading to be an absolutely amazing production? Anli obviously takes her writing and all creative elements of film-making deadly serious. And despite all the hard work we had put into trying to get the screenplay to a point were everyone was happy and genuinely in love with the script, we obviously never reached that point. Her fears that we rushed the writing process, and were planning to shoot something that simply wasn’t ready, story wise was completely valid. At the end of the day, I guess what makes a film is STORY, STORY, STORY, and if the story is wrong – the whole film will fall apart. This is obviously what scared Anli to the point were she decided she couldn’t go on. Of course, the fact that we were only days away from shooting and there was still so much to do must have also been a deciding factor – as well as the fact that this whole venture was going to cost us so much money! And so, Anli left the project.","But why didn’t we stop and work things out? Well, here we come to the biggest problem. We are a great team here at latenite films, we have made great films and will continue to in the future. However with this film the three person creative collaboration is where we went most horribly wrong. Of the three key members of latenite, (becoming four) there are two creative minds and a technical mind. The two creative minds knew there was something wrong, we felt we couldn’t just do it as factory work. We needed to be working on something we truly believed in, something we believed in beyond the surface, beyond it’s colourful furry exterior. However the technical mind was of the mindset that if we just continue pushing and ignore the problems we will get past them. This is a great quality to posses especially as a producer; you need a person who is so stubborn who can push people through the bad times with sheer force. However, you also need to know how to stop, when you can see that things have been going in the wrong direction for a long time and that all which was the idea of the film is lost.","Caithlin and I continued building the craft on Monday, with Isaac up in Geelong continuing work on Pinky’s head. It was “full speed ahead” with the deadline looming, and still a lot to do. But despite all this – we were slowly winning. Although it was going to be tight (and by tight I mean to the nano-second), but we should have got everything built and ready for filming in time. Anli dropped in for a bit during the day, and over lunch we had some heavy discussions about the script and the overall direction of the production. She seemed to be loosing faith in the production, but given that we were only days away from shooting, and everything was gradually falling into place, I made the terrible assumption that she would just continue to ride aboard the crazy roller-coaster! I thought I’d been able to convince her once again that what we were trying to do what unique, exciting and in many respects ground-breaking. We weren’t just putting together a film for the sake of it – nor were we trying to cut corners or do things the easy way. We had a massively ambitious plan that involved lots of actors, locations, pyrotechnics, special effects, animatronics, shooting on a camera that is basically still in a prototype stage, and doing all this on basically no budget at all. The concept of Sakooz is hardly your average film student production – it’s an epic, big budget, fire, flames and smoke motion picture! Basically, we wanted to make an Australian version of The Host(visually and thematically that is), without the 10 billion won (which works out to be about $11 million Australian) in our back pockets. Challenging, yes. Impossible – hardly!","Chris, Isaac and Caithlin, I really don’t know how to say this in the best way possible, and I apologise for not being able to tell you this in person but I don’t think I could explain it properly at all. To put it simply, I can’t mentally pull myself through this project any more. After being sick and being away from you guys, I took on a different perspective about the whole project which I can’t seem to reverse no matter how hard I try. I want to be there for you guys, as your friend, to support you in everything you do, but I also really care about being a writer, and from a story point of view, through nobody’s fault except for my own, I feel like I’ve compromised too much of what I really care about. I’ve known this for a long time, but have always maintained the mentality that I can put it on the back burner and ‘fight’ my way through. But now, without a true belief in the story, I can’t physically do this. I know this will seem very unfair, selfish and weak of me to do, but I hope you somehow understand, and not take this personally.","Given that we were building the craft in the middle of suburbia, as soon as it became dark, we had to stop building, not because of the lack of light – but because I don’t think the neighbours would have been too happy with us smashing wood with hammers, attempting to use power tools and singing songs from Triple M at some ungodly hour of the morning. So at night, we put down our tools, and continued work on other things – schedules, animatronics, the Pinky baby, call sheets, etc. With only a week to go until shooting – we had a lot to do","Having read books like Rebel Without a Crew (Robert Rodriguez) and Peter Jackson, A Film-Makers Journey (Brian Sibley), I guess I’ve never seen the problem with just making the decision to just sit down and write a really cool screenplay that I for one would personally like to see. I’m a strong believer in just making films that you would like to see, as I’m sure that there are at least one or two other people in the world that have the same taste and humour as me. And if I can create a reaction from just one person, then that’s what I think it’s all about. Film-making, in my opinion is about creating reactions from your audience and about making people really think and question the world they live in. Some people may say that most films are purely just in it for the money, and they don’t change anything. I disagree! Take for instance Jurassic Park (1993). At first glances, you might wrongly assume that this movie was just solely created to sell tickets. And I guess, in some ways it was. But just like most (if not all) of Steven Spielberg’s movies, this film also addresses all kinds of things about what’s good and bad about the world we live in. Although you might not notice it at first – this movie makes you question things. Should we mess with nature? Is family the most important thing? Is your life more important that your loved ones? Although this film is a big, action-packed roller-coaster ride – it also has messages embedded into it, and morals. And I think you’ll find that with all GOOD movies, one of the key reasons that makes them good, is the fact that they question the world we live in, and make you ask questions in your head. That what I wanted to do with Sakooz! Sure I wanted to create a really “cool” movie with lots of action, explosions, cool aliens, etc. But I also wanted to create something that made you question things. I wanted a film that had the heart of Garden State (2004), with the action of Transformers (2007), and the humour and visual style of The Host (2006).","I am going to pursue some ideas I have been working on for some time and see what comes of them. Above everything I have learned to push my opinions a little harder even if it compromises relationships.","I came to my house from Clifton Springs dressed in work clothes prepped to finish the spacecraft for the film. I was blocking out all my rational thoughts as I commonly did during the daytime. Caithlin (Art Director) came to my house to work on the ship and I could tell instantly that something was wrong; she had a distressed look on her face as she explained to me that Anli had quit. When Chris arrived we sat down in my yard and had a very long discussion, going round and round in circles weighing up the pros and cons. We all decided it was best to pull out, all of us quite reluctant; knowing though it was undoubtedly the harder route, it was the smarter one.","I shut myself down and just thought of it as a shit-house ass-munching job of which I have done many. I stopped thinking about what it meant and just went along with it. It was impressive at times, I had formula pitches I would use to bullshit to people that it was a good concept. But at times it shone through, like when we pitched our final proposal to the lecturers at our university. I thought I should try to actually think about it and what I believed about it, I had nothing, and this film was no longer a positive part of me. It became a cancer, filling me with anger and rage, I began to hate everything it represented. Even beginning to hate those I worked with, though underneath the rage I loved them dearly. I went along with it during the day going about it as a job trying to distract myself from its dark side. I even enjoyed parts of it, but only because I was able to disconnect myself from the deeper elements of the film.","I was listening to a podcast the other day, from the amazing team at fxguide where they were running a fxguide/fxphd hosted a roof top party at Siggraph. Although the whole podcast was fantastic, there was one section that Mike Seymour was talking about (in which he himself was quoting Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar) that really caught my attention. He explained that: * you need really good people because the idea itself isn’t neraly as important as the execution. And a good team with a bad idea, will actually just fix it or replace it. A bad team with a good idea will just make a bad film.’* If you haven’t listened to the podcast already, I highly recommend you do, because there are some other words of wisdom that are just really helpful and inspirational. And I guess, this point perfectly sums up why I wanted to make the trailer despite all the problems. The idea was good – not perfect, but the initial concept has so much potential. However, more important than that, we have an AMAZING team working on this production. We have the most incredible DOP I could have asked for, the most amazing production team, the more incredible crew that went above and beyond, an amazing pyro and special effects team – in fact, everyone was just so terrific, and I can’t thank everyone enough for all their hard work. We ran over schedule ever day – and not once did anyone get angry or start putting up a fuss. So thank you to everyone that helped get Sakooz through principle photography!","I’ve never been one to just give up, regardless of how tough things get. It’s just not in my nature. However, this situation really put me to the test. I felt trapped – I couldn’t see a logical way out. But after discussing things with my incredibly supportive family, I started calling up friends and asking for their advice. I was still shaking like crazy. I had no idea what lay in the future. After calling up heaps of people, the general consensus was that I should just go for it. Don’t give up no matter how hard things get. Just continue on. I started thinking back to all the books and stories I’ve ever read. Every film has these kinds of issues. But they always get through it with a bit of hard work and determination. It was decided – despite loosing the Director, Art Director, and Assistant Director (and my co-writers), the show must go on!","If you made it this far down the post – thank you! This has turned into a bit of an essay!","In the space of one day, my whole world collapsed, and then I suddenly found myself no longer as just the producer of this crazy project, but also the Director, Art Director and everything else. It had gone from a group project to a solo mission. But I wasn’t alone – I had an AMAZING team behind me. I had a incredibly brilliant crew in place, and an equally impressive cast. Despite all that had happened, I all of a sudden felt like maybe, just maybe, we could pull this off. It wasn’t going to be easy – but we the support of my family, friends and the rest of Team Sakooz, I felt that we might just win the war after all…","It is nobody’s fault; the film just didn’t have any depth, heart, or substance. The primary problem behind this is that we attempted to develop the idea as a group of three, each of us taking turns at it and sometimes developing it together. With a project this big it really needs to begin as one person’s idea or baby, they can seek consultation from the people around them, but the story remains theirs enabling that person to immerse themselves entirely in the story. This film was nobody’s baby and then at the same time it was everybody’s baby. We all knew the story in different ways, which constantly caused major confusion.","It was at night when these elements caught up with me, causing me to lose many nights of sleep, fighting with my head. To a large degree it was the fault of us creative people, we tried to voice our opinions and were shut down, but we should have tried harder. I guess because we loved Chris so much we wanted to diplomatically convince him, but once you have pressed the go button on Chris there is no compromise, no change, until the project be completed, no matter what the outcome. We obviously should have tried harder, but would it have changed anything?","It was more than just this; we the creative minds should have spoken out. But we did, we tried to change the direction of things at various points along the journey. Whether it is 5-minute attempts or an hour trying to get rid of the ball and chain, which held us on this one blind path to… well? We were strongly opposed by the technical mind and were shut down, I admit after my last objection I just went back in my hole, knowing that the opposing opinions were not open to change.","Lets flash back to the start of August. Things were stressful and chaotic, but we looked as if we were heading in the right direction. During the first weekend of the month was spent urgently trying to get some of the more creative and construction elements of the production finished. Isaac and Tim (our animatronics guru) continued work trying to get Pinky’s face finished, and the rest of us frantically started building a massive space ship in Isaac’s back yard. There were a couple of trips to Bunnings, a few trips to dodgy parts of town to grab unloved furniture, lots of hammering, jig-sawing, cutting, pasting, bleeding, gluing – everything was happening! Most of the ship was constructed out of things we got for dirt cheap at the Reverse Art Truck (RAT), in Ringwood. Basically you purchase a plastic bag for $25, and then you can fill it up with whatever “junk” you want. We bought two bags and filled them up with all kinds of weird and wonderful items (bits of foam, wires, tubing, cardboard off-cuts, bottle lids, malformed containers, etc.), and also purchased some large chipboard-like panels for $2 each. Most of the wood we used for the spaceship came from one of Isaac’s old beds, however we also picked up some other bits and pieces from Bunnings, as we didn’t have the time to hunt down more free wood. Despite the fact that neither Caithlin nor myself are builders, and Isaac wasn’t around for some of the time – we did a pretty good job. Things were starting to come together!","Now to finish up this post, I’ll leave you with a blog entry that Isaac wrote the day after I decided to take on the project solo, that explains his reasons for why he chose not to complete Sakooz. It’s been really tricky writing this, as I don’t want to put words into his mouth – so hopefully this clearly states his point of view:","Ok, I’ll warn you in advance. This is going to be a BIG blog entry. Quite possibly the biggest blog entry known to man. And yes, I’ve read all the “how to write blogs” articles on the Internet, and know that blogs are unlike books and newspaper – you need to keep them short and straight to the point. Blog readers have a short attention span, bla, bla, bla. But you know what – stuff it! The whole point of this blog is to help other film-makers learn from our mistakes, so I think the more information we jam into this, the better for everyone. Besides, no one is forcing you to read this anyway! And so, with that said, lets bring you up to speed with what’s been happening over the last few weeks. Hold onto your office chairs!","On Monday night, we continued working around the clock – building, sewing, writing, calculating. And then on Tuesday, the first bombshell exploded. We were all spending the day away from each other each working on our own things – Isaac was up in Geelong working on the head, Caithlin was at home working on baby Pinky, Anli was busily trying to put together some additional script and character information for our actors, and I was also at home busily trying to work out the logistics and financial of the whole production. Then, just after midday on Tuesday, Anli sent us all an e-mail:","One of the biggest problems that Isaac and Anli have always had about this project is that they have felt as if we have been writing the script to a deadline – which is exactly what we’ve been doing. Last year we decided that we wanted to make a feature film, and after thinking about a couple of different ideas, we all decided that “TV Tubsters” (which became Sakooz), was the way to go. And so we started developing the idea. At first we started trying to put it together as a group and we did this for a couple of months. Then we decided that it was too hard to write together with three people and so we left the task to Isaac. Despite my objections, we also decided that it was going to be way too hard to complete a whole feature film in a year at University and so we scaled back our production to a three minute promotional teaser/trailer. Although I still really like the idea of the trailer, and think it will lead to bigger and better things, deep down I still believe if we just “went for it”, we could have pulled off a feature length film – but I guess we’ll never know! Isaac then spent his whole summer stuck in front of the iMac writing away. He wrote and he wrote and he wrote. At the same time I started studying every single writing book there is from Story (Robert McKee), to How to Build a Great Screenplay (David Howard) and even books like Screenwriting for Dummies (Laura Schellhardt). Having attended many, many script writing lectures at all kinds of institutions over the years (both as a student and as a technician in charge of making sure the presentation runs smoothly) – I actually have a really good understanding of the screen writing process and the techniques and principles behind it. However, I’ve never considered myself a writing, and therefore have never practised the craft. Anyway… A first draft was very close to being finished by Isaac. In March, Isaac, Anli and myself went to beautiful down-town Hong Kong for a couple of weeks for the Hong Kong International Film Festival. Of course, the plan was that when we weren’t watching films, we would be further developing the script. As could be expected, this never happened, and we spent most of our time doing touristy things and going out on the town. However, when we finally returned to uni, and Anli and myself read the draft in its latest state, I don’t think either of us understood it. It was funny, it was quirky, it was out there (one of our biggest inspirations at this stage in development was Gremlins 2), but I for one just simply didn’t “get it”. And so, I made the EXTREMELY tough decision of trying to convince Isaac that we should re-think the first draft in its current form. It was hard (especially as he had just spend weeks and weeks in front of his computer busily typing away), but eventually that’s what we decided to do. We went back to square one. And then, one more as a group, we started busily “smashing” together another feature film concept – obviously along the same lines (i.e. aliens on a kids TV show), but just with a different approach and direction.","So, despite all odds, and despite all the issues and problems, regardless of the fact that we lost our director, art director and assistant producer, the show must go on! Over the next few blog entries, I will start filling you in with what happening in the days leading up to filming, and then what happened on Day One through to Five of Principle Photography. It sure was one hell of a ride!","So, in an attempt to get this post back on track, what happened after Anli’s e-mail? Well the next day was absolute hell. It will go down in history as of my the toughest days I’ve ever had to go through. Now this might sound like an overreaction – but believe me, it wasn’t. And I’ve been through some pretty tough dates in the past, believe me! Isaac, Caithlin and I met at Isaac’s house. When I got there, I went round the back, as the original plan was that we would continue to build the spaceship all day. But when I got round, no one had hammers or glue in hand. And so, we started talking, arguing and discussing. It was like some kind of a crazy triangle. Isaac had decided that for various reasons, we shouldn’t continue on with the trailer. Caithlin was still (at this stage) in the middle. She saw everything from Isaac’s point of view, but at the same time, we’d put so much work into everything, and were so close to filming, that she also felt that it would be a shame to throw everything in. I was at the other end of the spectrum. I REALLY wanted to make Sakooz a reality. And the discussions continued. We were hitting road block after road block. I’d tried to convince them both we should just finish what we started, because despite what they might think, I still believed in the concept and story and honestly believed we were heading in the right direction. Isaac tried to convince me that we should stop now as the whole production had bad foundations from the get go. Caithlin tried to see things from both points of view. Eventually however, I lost the battle. They both decided that they definitely didn’t want to do it. I was shattered. But what could I do? Without a Director, Assistant Director or Art Director, it was just me all alone. I was outnumbered, and I lost the war. And so, in Isaac’s backyard, we made the INCREDIBLY tough decision that Sakooz was not going to be finished this year. I was devestated – seriously. After all the money, blood and effort I’d put into this production (that I TRUELY felt strongly about), everything had blown up in my face. One of my final words were “I don’t care what anyone thinks, I’m going to get this film made one day”. We decided that I would keep everything in storage at my place. And so, I left. The drive home was a so hard. At first, I just expected it. It almost felt a bit like a relief. I no longer had to worry about all the problems and issues that Sakooz brought with it. But it was an easy way out. As I got closer and closer to home however, I started to break down. To be honest, I just didn’t know what I was going to say to my family and friends. The fact that I’d have to tell my family that we’d basically just given up (and yes, I know it wasn’t as simple as that), was too much. As I got closer and closer to home, with Lovers Electric blasting through the stereo, I started to ball my eyes out. It was all too much. I nearly ran off the road a couple of times. But all I wanted to do was get home. I felt like a three year old again that had just been bullied in the playground. When I got home, my family thought something SERIOUSLY bad had happened. Had someone died? I know it seems really silly, getting so worked up about a stupid university project – but when you put so much heart and soul into something, only to have it taken away from you in one foul swoop, it’s tough. I knew deep down that it wasn’t the end of the world, and I knew that I shouldn’t be getting so worked up about it, but at the time, my body and mind just gave up. It was all too hard. But, after much calming down, and hugs from my amazing family (and yes, this all sounds very lame and stupid – but anyway!), I started to regain some kind of composure. They started to ask me serious questions – why did we decide to give up on the trailer? What needed to be done? What are the pros and cons of the situation? Could I just do it myself? Slowly but surely my brain started working again. I started to seriously consider everything.","The ringleader… Chris!","Until next time, onward and upward! ( Which reminds me – congratulations Chris Jones on all your recent success with Gone Fishing! Bring on the Oscars 2009! )…","We don’t know what will happen from here; Chris has changed his mind overnight and has chosen to pursue the film. Why? Maybe partially for fear of the alternative. This is ok, though I must admit I feel betrayed, even though I know this was not his intention. I understand why he is not ready to make such a powerfully destructive and painful decision. Whether he finishes it or not I hope he learns the many valuable lessons I have learned from this experience.","We worked like this primarily so that we could achieve the result by the deadline, this is the second problem. When developing a feature motion picture a deadline is rarely a good thing. These problems lead to the overruling problem, it became a business, it felt like we were a factory churning out a pre-packaged microwavable instant-movie-matic 3000.","Well, I am the Director of Sakooz, or at least I was the Director. Yesterday we completely scrapped the film, it was an extremely hard decision for all of us, and it would have been far easier to continue along ignoring it’s problems just to finish the damn thing. However if we were to continue along we would have not only been wasting our own time. Not that this is a problem considering the fact that we have already spent over 10 months on this project. One of the problems is that we would have been wasting many other people’s time and resources. We were lying to everybody involved, convincing them all that it was a good idea when we didn’t truly believe in it ourselves.","Well… that’s all for now!

We’ve been doing some more camera and lighting tests on location, organising all the additional paperwork that needs to be done, finialising locations, building sets, costumes and props, tinkering with animatronics, blowing things up (pyro tests!), doing special effects tests – so much stuff! We’ve literally been jamming as much stuff as we possibly can into each day, and we’re making amazing progress! But despite this, the to-do list is still very long. Some time soon we’ll post some photos of Pinky’s head being put together, and once we’ve got shooting out of the way, we might even write up some proper posts on how we went about making it.

The closer we get to shooting the more problems we solve, the more problems we discover, and the more things we try to jam into a day. When I pressed “Publish” on my last post, we only had one cast member to find. This then increased to two, but luckily, thanks to another few days of long auditions we have now OFFICIALLY cast our complete film! We even ended up creating two new characters, which is a little scary, but we honestly feel it’s for the best. That’s the beautiful thing about independent film making – you can make this kind of decisions on the spot. Casting has taken up a lot of our time over the last few weeks – just trying to lock down the very best people we can. I’m VERY happy to say, that we have an amazing cast lined up – every member is truly fantastic. We also spent a lot of time meeting up with potential crew members, and sussing out more locations, writing countless e-mails, making countless phone calls, and most challenging of all – just trying to get some kind of a schedule together. It’s so unbelievably hard to get everyone (i.e. cast) in the same place at the same time – especially when you’re not paying anyone! It really is a logistical nightmare. If one thing doesn’t go to plan (i.e. a vital cast or crew member can’t work on a specific day, or a piece of gear or location is only available at a certain time), then it really stuffs up the whole “grand plan”, and some of the time you just need to re-think everyone from scratch. It’s not a job for the light hearted!","We were originally planning to have our first day of principle photography THIS COMING WEEKEND believe it or not. But, for better or for worse (votes still to be counted), we have had to reschedule due to actors availibility. On the negative side, this has meant that we’ve had to re-think a lot of things and call up and cancel stuff, and reorganise things for another time, but on the positive side, at least we get a bit more time in pre-production. So now, our first day of shooting is on Tuesday 12th of August. We have SO much to do up until then. At least now we have our cast and locations sorted, but we still need to build sets, props and costumes – write up call sheets and schedules, do rehearsals, complete visual effects tests, and numerous other things! Some how, the list of things to do seems to get bigger day by day even though we are ticking things off at an amazing rate! The best news is that Anli is back in action, after fighting with Glandual Fever for several weeks – so it’s really nice to have her smiling and happy face back! We really missed her, and are very happy that’s she’s feeling a fair amount better (not perfect – but these things take time).","So anyway – I must be off… I have a stupidly big list of things to achieve tonight, so I’d better get back to it. Apologies for not writing more over the last few weeks, and also for not putting up many photos. We still need to upload some of the camera test footage as well – so many things to do! But all of these things will come in due course. Thanks to everyone who has spent us e-mails asking questions, and giving us positive feedback – we honestly really appreciate it!

The last two weeks just flew by. It’s scary. Seriously.","I’ve just looked through my diary, trying to remember what we’ve been doing since I last wrote on this blog, and to be honest – I have no idea. It’s been chaotic. I wish I had some exact stats – we’ve driven so many km’s, wrote thousands of e-mails, made hundreds of phone calls, seen hundreds of people, drank so much coffee, watched no TV, ate very little food, seen many fantastic locations, begged countless times, etc. over the last few weeks. I know I say this every single blog entry – but it’s true. Everything is getting rapidly more intense with every day.","Due to the fact that we’re pulling in so many favours, this also means that we are restricted to certain shooting dates (i.e. a gaffer might be willing to donate a light or two, but he can only do it on specific days when he’s got nothing else on). This has forced us to shoot even sooner than planned – our first shoot dates are now on the 26th and 27th of July! That’s not that long away… 16 days to be precise! And we’ve still got so much stuff to do before then… Luckily, however, we’re not shooting again until the 11th of August, which means we have two weeks in between to sort out everything else. It’s not a lot of time – but at least it’s something.","So where are we up to in terms of the production? Casting is now almost completely locked in. We only have one major character that we haven’t cast yet. We’ve locked in 80% of our locations. All the majors ones have been finalised – we’re now just after some of the smaller (yet still important) locations, such as hallways and store rooms. Costumes and animatronics are coming along slowly, but we should JUST make the deadline. Set Construction is a big issue at the moment – we have a lot to do in this department, and not a lot of time (or money!) to do it. Which brings me to our biggest issue at the moment: money! It’s so incredibly hard to find the funds to get things off the ground.","This is one of the biggest problems with university courses. Sure you get access to all this great gear – but, as a student, you are not allowed to apply for any of the various federal, state or local government grants. This seems really stupid! Surely the whole point of all these grants is to help create the best possible content possible? If students could get access to these grants, then not only would they have access to all of the great university facilities, but all the money they save in equipment hire could be devoted to other departments. The result? Vastly better production values! Also, because students would have to spend less time trying to find money for their products, they can spend more time actually making their films!","I think that’s one of the primary reasons why a lot of crap comes out of film schools – students simply don’t have the funds to boost their production values. Now I’m sure I’m going to get e-mail after e-mail abusing me about all this. Everyone’s going to say, “you don’t need a lot of money to make a good film”, “you just need a good story”, “you just need a good script”, “a good story shot on a mobile phone is better than a bad film shot on 35mm”, etc. And of course, this is all true! But I’m not suggesting that governments just throw money at any old project! Obviously there would be very strict guidelines and procedures, and only the best scripts would get green-lit and funded. And for this simple reason, I think this would push students to spend more time creating beautiful scripts, simply so they can get the funding to make the film. As sad and bad as it is, money is always such a strong driving force. I think if there was some kind of funding incentive, then it would help force students to really fine tune their script drafts, and help ensure that the shooting script is really at the best it can be.","Anyway – this isn’t going to happen in the short term, so in our case there’s no point worrying about it! What we need to do is focus our attention on finding money via untraditional means. We have a couple of tricks up our sleeves, but the biggest enemy is time. As we’re shooting very shortly, and we have so much other stuff do it, we simply don’t have time to pursue our other money-making ventures. It’s such a difficult thing to try and juggle!","I guess the one thing we’ve all learnt so far this year, is that in the film world, a year isn’t a very long time. We’ve been working much more than full time on this production all year, and yet we’re still so far behind. Now I really do understand why it takes so many years from concept to creation to get a film up. And we’ve made it a lot harder for ourselves – even though we’re only doing a two and a half minute teaser/trailer, we have to basically treat it like a feature film. We need to work everything out – and then only shoot sections of it. But I guess, all this work means that when it eventually becomes time to make the feature film, we’re going to be so prepared it’s not funny… Well, I say this, but no doubt when it comes to making it we’ll have 9 billion new problems!","So what’s in store in the weeks ahead. Lots. We need to get so much done, it’s really not funny. But at the end of the day, it’s just a matter of doing it. Some might say it’s impossible. Some might say it’s crazy. But we tend to keep our mouths shut, and just get on with it! Oh, of course with the exception of keeping you all informed via this blog!","Finally, to wrap things up, for those that haven’t already, make sure you sign up for the Red Centre podcast, courtesy of the team at fxguide/fxphd.

It’s really scary to think that we’re pretty much in the middle of the year now. I’m a little bit scared that if I blink it will suddenly be September, and if I blink again it will be January 2009! So as a way to combat that I’ve gaffer taped my eye lids open. It doesn’t seem to be working – time literally is zooming past my eyes!","So what’s been happening since my last confession? Well, as I’m sure you can imagine, a lot! After writing the last blog entry it was straight into “fundraiser” mode – all hands on deck were devoted to ensuring that the Lens Flair event at loop bar was going to go to plan. That meant sending THOUSANDS of e-mailing, ringing up HUNDREDS of people, and biting our lips and approaching hundreds of shop owners face to face, to see if they would be interested in donating anything towards our little event. Anli and myself literally just drove to big shopping complexes (such as Chadstone) and one by one visted every single store in the complex “selling” our story. And it was hard. We got rejected a lot – which was demoralising! But for every five or so rejections, one person felt sorry for us, or got honestly excited about the project and gave us a small donation. So we walked away with quite a lot of stuff – from shampoos, to gift vouchers, towels, chocolates, books, free hair cuts, all kinds of weird and wonderful things! If you were one of the people who donated something to us – THANK YOU! It’s actually quite incredible the quantity and quality of “free stuff” we actually got! So for all the other film makers out there looking at ways to raise money for your film – don’t be afraid to ask for free stuff and then auction or sell it off! If you’re persistant and hard working, the amount of items you can get is quite high.","As I said, the rest of that week was just getting everything organised for the big Thursday night event! Putting together hampers, encoding videos for the DVD screenings, doing sound checks, printing labels, etc. It was one crazy week – there was so much to do, and to be perfectly honest, just not enough people to do it, which meant everyone had to work around the clock pulling everything together. But soon enough it was Thursday, and we got everything done in time! To start things off, here are some photos of the event:","Overall, I think we can classify the event as a success. We had a massive turn out – probably around 200 people at it’s peak, although we had people coming and going all night. Not sure how many unique people turned up, but I would imagine it would be around the 300-350 mark. A lot of the people that were there for the first screening didn’t hang around for the second screening, but luckily were replaced by new people! From all reports, everyone had a fantastic time! We’ve recieved quite a few e-mails saying “thank you” for putting on the night, and saying how much fun they had which is great! Word has even got out into the “low budget” film making community in Melbourne saying how fun the event was – and a lot of people who didn’t attend for whatever reason have said to me they wish they made the extra effort, or changed their schedule around to fit it in.","However! The only downside to the night, and it is quite a big downside unfortuantely is that we didn’t make a huge amount of money. Don’t get me wrong, we turned over an OK profit – but we didn’t get the numbers we were hoping for. Unfortunately for us, it seemed that most of the people that came along were poor. No one could afford to spend big money on anything. It’s almost criminal, but some people walked away with some of the most amazing auction items for so cheap! For instance, in one of our hampers, not only was it jam packed with so many great things (the whole hamper value was estimated at around $200) , but it also contained a $50 Sanity voucher, and the hamper only sold for $40. Even if you just consider the Sanity voucher, the punter did well – but when you take into account everything else that was in there, but person did fantastically! One of the biggest issues for us what that in regards to the silent auction, the few people in the audience that did actually have money got everything for cheap because no one was up for bidding against them! Despite all our best efforts to attract the more wealthy crowd, it just didn’t work out that way at the end of the day. In retrospect, instead of putting on a really fun and cool event (which was focussed primarily at “art” people – as we had a film screening and auctioned off lots of artwork), next time we should do something unique and “out there” that reflects the film. I don’t think we took enough risks, and by having a very “safe” event, there was not enough reason for people to come along. I think we also went about raising money the wrong way. All our income was coming from raffles, the silent auction and a lucky dip box (full of brand new CDs!). If instead we had a book charge, and we took some of the profits from the bar, I think we would have done a lot better. However, that said, if we had a door charge, then we may not have attracted the large crowd that we did. It’s a bit of a catch 22!","So, at the end of the day, we are still in need of more funds to get this trailer off the ground. As I said, we did make a fair amount of money, but no were near enough to cover all the expenses of the trailer. We still have a lot of work to do!","The day after Lens Flair we had yet another road bump – one of our key production team members has pulled out of the production for various reasons. Although we can “live without him” it just means that individually, we now all have even more work to complete – which is tough. We may find someone to fill his place, although it could be quite tricky considering our time frame. Which brings me to a very good point – the hardest thing about film making (especially in the low-budget world) is finding great people who can work happily together, and then keeping everyone happy and together! As the producer, I spend a lot of my precious time just keeping everyone motivated and excited about the production. You become even kind of like a “mother goose” type figure – you’re responsible to cheering everyone up when they get depressed about the production, and generally just try and keep everyone on the right track. It’s hard when the hours are horrible, the work load is huge, and no one is getting paid. Personal life vs The Film is always a big issue. But the show must go on!","After several deep and meaning fulls, I then had to head off to Sydney for the week for work. The timing couldn’t have been worse, but there was no way out of it! So I spend a week away from the production – but meanwhile, back at base camp, lots of things were happening! The animatronic head continued to be work on, as did all the costumes. Special effects tests were completed. Despite my absence, the show certainly continued!","But when I got back at the start of this week, I fly into yet another road block – but this time an even bigger one than last! One of our key production members, Anli, has “Glandual Fever” and will be out of action for several weeks. Now with two key production members down and out, it meant that we had to push back our shooting schedule. Originally, we were planning to shoot in July – but with Anli sick and David off doing other things, we had no choice but to slam on the brakes. This is quite a big pain – as it means that we have all kinds of new issues, especially in regards to equipment availibility.","Step forward into the present – today. We obviously have a lot of work to do, and now with Anli sick, it means that everyone else has to do even more work. But, with a little bit of luck, we’ll survive! We still have a huge amount to do, but I guess one bonus is that we have a little bit more time to do it now. We’re planning to shoot in the middle of August. Exact shooting dates have not yet been confirmed, but we’re trying to work them out as I type.","So that’s what’s been happening the last couple of weeks! It really has been a bumpy ride so far! Whenever we think we’re starting to win the war, something else comes and bites us in the butt! But I guess that’s what film-making is all about! You just need to push your way through regardless of what happens and get your vision up there on the screen, regardless of the obstacles.","I’m still planning to upload some of our camera test material on the blog – hopefully we’ll have something up by the end of this week. But I’m also going to start posting other intersting things as they pop up – like links to cool websites, and podcasts. So keep an eye out on this blog (or subscribe via RSS), as I’ll start posting more and more in the coming weeks, months (and if I survive that long) years.","That’s all for now!

But with all our university assignments due on the Friday – Wednesday and Thursday was dedicated solely to getting all that work done. Again, two nights of very little sleep – if any. Then Friday was the day all the work was due. We all got it in – just. We did some good stuff – and some bad. But we survived – and that’s the main thing! In the middle of all the mayhem, we also had a meeting with Loop Bar to discuss our fund-raiser night – which is THIS COMING THURSDAY! Make sure you come along – it should be a great night!","And the day continued to be fun and exciting! After playing around with the RED for a few hours, and having some “training lessons” on how the whole post production workflow takes place, we headed off to Digital Pictures to do a one-light telecine session of our 16mm tests. On a properly calibrated big monitor, the footage looked incredible – especially the 500T VISION3 stock, which was virtually grain-less considering the scene was only lit by candle light! Again, at SOME stage, we’ll post some stills of the footage, so that you can compare the RED to the Super 16mm footage.","In the morning we met up with Cail & Pete from Inspiration Studios to try out their new RED camera. If you don’t know what a RED camera is, and you’ve got anything to with the Film & Television industry, then stop right now, and check out the RED website, because RED is BIG!","Last weekend was then a chance to recover from the pitch – we really needed a break! Although, I don’t think any of us really had a break – we just continued on doing all our other stuff that needs to be done, that isn’t Sakooz related. We still had all our individual university projects and assignments to do – so all of our “to do” lists were quite full up! Which brings me to lesson number three for today – if you want a life, then don’t go into film making – it takes up EVERY single moment of your time. Seriously! But I guess, if you’re crazy enough to be reading this blog entry, then there is probably very little chance of convincing you that the film industry is a horrible place to get into. Anyway!","Now, exclusive to all you blog readers, I’m going to show you something very special to end this post! Here is a sketch of “Pinky” (one of the Sakooz characters) for your viewing pleasure!

Enjoy!","Pinky","RED Camera Tests RED Camera Tests","Right through pre-production for Sakooz, we have very much loved the idea of shooting Super 16mm, because it looks fantastic! However, there has always been a whisper that if there was anyway we could shoot on a RED, then it would DEFINITELY be worth looking into! There are only a very limited number of them in Melbourne at the moment – and not even that many in Australia as a whole, so just getting hold of one is quite a challenge at the moment, because there under so much demand! But luckily for us, Cail & Pete had a rare day when the camera wasn’t booked out, so we jumped at the opportunity to do some tests! To start things off, here are some photos!","So that basically sums up what we’ve been doing lately, and why you haven’t heard much from us! Busy! Busy! But despite all this whining, and despite all the problems and complications, it’s all a lot of fun! I wouldn’t recommend it to ANYONE – but if you’ve got the film-making bug (and you’ll know if you’ve got it), then you can’t live without the thrill and excitement of trying to make the impossible possible.","The last two weeks have been MASSIVE! After my last blog entry, we have had so many fantastic ups and so many depressing downs! It really has been an emotional roller-coaster of a couple of weeks! Now all I have to do now is try to remember everything that has happened…","The Monday after location scouting was the start of an exceptionally big week ahead. On the upcoming Friday, we had our “pitch” for university, so before that, we had a lot of work to do! The whole week was basically dedicated to putting together pre-production documentation – scene breakdowns, location documentation, post production pathways, schedules, budgets, bla, bla, bla! So much work to do, and so very little time! Of course, this was mainly our fault – as we left a lot of it to the last minute. But we’ve also been so flat out with other things – location scouting, organising costumes, casting auditions, camera tests, and the list goes on, and on! Time is just ALWAYS against us. Lesson to new film makers – not matter how much time you think you have, you’ll always need more! Monday through to Thursday we just kept our heads down and kept on working away with very little, if no sleep. On Thursday, Isaac and Anli came over to my house, and we continued to just throw together our “production bible”. After Anli left in the afternoon, Isaac and myself kept on smashing away, and soon it became 4:00am on Friday morning – another night of no sleep! After an hour of shut eye, it was time for breakfast, and then off we went to uni – slightly exhausted, but we had put together our production bible – mostly finished. To be perfectly honest, the pitch went pretty horrible. I’m still not sure whether I should be saying this in our blog, for the whole world to read, but I guess when we decided to start this blog, we made the decision to keep it honest, as it’s primary purpose is to help out others by explaining what we’ve done and tried, and also failed, so that you can learn from our mistakes (and so that you don’t have to do them as well!). So, anyway – the pitch was bad. Not only were we under prepared, but due to the fact that our brains were all running at half speed (if at all), we couldn’t answer even the most simple of questions. What’s worse is that the only things we were asked, were about story – and we’ve spend so much time, energy and resources on the feature film story and concept development! The main problem was that we were having serious trouble expressing our ideas out loud – mainly because we were tired, but also because some of us were sick. We knew all the answers, and despite our best efforts, we just couldn’t convince the panel of four that we knew what we were talking about. Lesson number one, never go in to anything under prepared! Lesson number two, never go into a pitch exhausted – as you’ll need your brain! It went bad – we stuffed up – but the show must go on! We all knew were we went wrong, and we now all know how NOT to do things. On a positive note, despite the bashing, the panel didn’t really question anything BUT our story, which means at least we have the production side of things remotely under control. We also have a huge amount of faith and belief in the concept, so we’ve taken there hints and suggestions on board, and are continuing on the adventure as per planned! Just a minor little speed hump, but I think we came off OK…","Then on last Friday night – it was finally a chance to let our hair down. We all went out to a local pub near uni and celebrated with everyone the fact that we survived the week! And what a week it was!","This weekend we’ve just been concentrating on getting things ready for the fund-raiser. Again, like always, so much to do and so very little time!","We all hoped that the new week would bring with it a new slate. But the Monday after was a disaster as well. It seemed like everything was against us! We had to pick up gear in the morning, and just ran into problem after problem! Then in the afternoon, it just got even worse! Everything just went WRONG! But somehow, we survived the day – JUST. But luckily for everyone Tuesday was a FANTASTIC day – the complete polar opposite! Finally!","We basically just followed the same procedure as per our 16mm tests. At some stage in the near future we’ll upload some of the footage from the tests for your viewing pleasure! But we also did some slow motion passes, which looked amazing! Overall, we had a really fun and educational morning playing with the RED camera – and we must say, even with the stock standard RED zoom lens, the results from the camera are incredible!

I have no idea how you not only find the time, but also write stuff that actually makes sense, and has good spelling and grammar! OK, so now I have to find back to what has actually happened over the last week…","Well, as I said previously, Saturday was camera test day. We piled up James and Doris (the names of my 4WD and Isaac’s van), and headed to a football grandstand in Melbourne to test some Super 16 stock. We shot several different things (colour charts, grey scale charts, city skyline, people running, etc.) using the different stocks (specifically Kodak 50D VISION2, 200T VISION2 and 500T VISION3) at different exposures, and using different filters. We also shot the exact same material using a Panasonic HVX202 and Sony Z1P (using the fixed lenses) to use as a comparison. Originally we intended to use a P+S adapter on both the digital cameras, however we couldn’t get one that weekend. The day went pretty much as planned – although the weather was horrible and freezing! Here are some photos of the day for your viewing pleasure:","Camera Tests Camera Tests","As you can see, we had a lot of fun! Especially when Anli and myself had to run around pretending to be Sakooz creatures! After many hours of freezing and burning film, we wrapped for the day. On Sunday, with a substantially smaller crew, as a lot of people got sick on the Saturday, we headed off to Lara (near Geelong) to find a location for our big “crash landing” sequence. After much searching, we eventually came across a road that, although not perfect, seemed to look pretty good. We shot some camera tests at the location, and then when it got dark, we did some night fire camera tests. We especially wanted to test out how the new Kodak 500T VISION3 stock compares to the VISION2. And all of a sudden, the weekend was gone! Dear, oh dear!","Monday through to Friday was pretty much, what is becoming a stock standard week. Meeting after meeting, discussion after discussion, no food, no sleep, millions of e-mails! Who would want to live this life? Really! It’s all so crazy! Thursday was probably one of the bigger days, with meetings non-stop all day at various places around Melbourne for all different things. It was great though – we got to meet up with so many interesting and diverse people, all interested in what we are trying to achieve.","This weekend, it was all about location scouting. Anli, Isaac and I jumped in Doris (the 4WD) and zoomed around Victoria looking for suitable spots to film. Yesterday (Saturday), we mainly looked around the Geelong side of the world looking for “places in the middle of no-where” for the dramatic opening of the film. Then today, we headed down Mornington way, and around Portsea and Phillip Island, looking for the epic ending location. All things considered, we did quite well – we’ve found two locations that are almost exactly what we’re after, which is fantastic! They’re still not locked in 100% as of yet, but they certainly look the part. So we’re getting closer – which is great, as we haven’t got that long to go till we need to start shooting!","But there’s also been some huge announcements recently! Singer-songwriter Katie Weston is now opening our fund-raising night with an acoustic set, which is fantastic! But also, we’ve made the Nigel blog live! There currently only one episode online (plus a bunch of random blogs) – but another is coming online very soon (maybe even tonight). The production values aren’t great – but it’s quite funny, and well worth a look and listen! As the weeks go on, there will be more and more stuff appearing on Nigel’s site, so stay tuned!","So what’s in store for this coming week? A lot! A hell of a lot! On Friday we will be pitching our concept to our university, so that we can get “green lit” and given official permission to hire the gear required for the teaser/trailer. We have a lot of work to do up until then! Storyboards, shot lists, budgets, bla, bla, bla! The list goes on and on! We also need to lock in the final Sakooz costume designs, continue work on the animatronics, start building sets, etc. So more work to do, and so little time! What’s even more annoying is that now I’m starting to get sick! How annoying! It’s only a cold – but it’s not something you want when you need to get so much done. But I’ll survive! Unfortunately however, Anli and Isaac are also both still slowly recovering from their various bugs.","Anyway, I must be off! As always, if you have any questions or queries, feel free to either post a comment on this blog, or send us an e-mail! We’re ALWAYS more than happy to answer any questions you have about us, our work or about movie making in general. Until next time…","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"another-day-another-dollar","l":"Another day another dollar…","p":["A lot has happening this week – and boy, oh boy do I mean a lot! When you’re only getting around two hours sleep a night (maximum) you sure do get a lot done. But regardless of how much coffee you drink to keep you awake, you still seem to just run out of time. In film making, time is your number one enemy. It’s always against you, and it’s always looking for ways to make your life a living hell. But enough bitching about time…","Monday brought with it a whole heap of meetings. We met up with a whole collection of extremely talented costume design students, and other people interested in helping out with the Sakooz characters. You’ve really got to be careful when you do meetings all day, as you really do intake a massive amount of caffeine, simply because generally speaking we’ve been having crew meetings at the local coffee shop. After a very massive day, and exactly 318 e-mails later (for me alone that is!), after a quick two hours sleep, it was suddenly Tuesday! Once again, we had more meetings and discussions. This time with actual costume builders (more about this in the coming weeks!) and sound designers. I can’t really go into too much detail at this stage, but all the meetings went exceptionally well! Everyone seems genuinely excited about our concept, and they all really want to help us transform our idea into an actual feature film! It’s actually really inspiring to see people get inspired themselves, from an idea that we came up with. It really makes our day, when the eyes light up of the people we are pitching to – and start getting carried away thinking about how we can various bits and pieces to make the film happen. We’ve had so many great ideas and suggestions!","Wednesday was audition day again! 9:00am till 6:00pm – one audition every half hour. It’s only just longer than your standard working day – but I’ll tell you what, sitting in the one place for 9 hours straight, having to repeat yourself over-and-over again, and having to really concentrate on what in front of you, really takes it out of you! It’s just so exhausting! Once again, we had a great mix of audition’s, and some more interstate travellers. Unfortunately though, by the end of the day, our fearless leader, Director Isaac’s body had finally given up – and he started getting really sick again. Unfortunately he was too ill to make it on Thursday, so Anli and myself had to do it alone. But, as we’ve been developing the script and story together, this wasn’t a big deal, as we all equally know the every aspect of the production and story back-to-front. Despite the fact that Isaac had to take a “sickie” – despite the doctors request – he still continued to work at home. I’m not sure if it’s just a complete and utter devotion to the project, or whether he’s just clinically insane. Probably a bit of both. And then, he did something even more crazy – he still went to work on Thursday night, despite nearly being on his death bed. Unstoppable!","Today it was back to uni for a rarely attended class or two – and we also had to pick up gear, as we’re doing camera tests this weekend. We’re planning to do some tests using different stocks (Kodak 50D, 200T, 500T VISION3, etc.) on both a ARRI SRII 16:9 16mm and AATON A-Minima 16mm camera. We’re also going to have a Sony Z1P and Panasonic HVX202 set up for comparison. More on the camera tests in the coming days!","There’s lots of exciting things coming up as well! Within the next few days, we’ll be introducing a new blog to the site! I don’t want to give away too much just yet, but I can tell you now, that a person called “Nigel” has joined the team, and will be following us around. So keep and eye out on our website, as Nigel will soon be here to entertain and inform all! We’re also running a fund-raiser night at Loop Bar in Melbourne on the 12th of June. We’ll post information about it on the website soon – but in the meantime, if you join our Facebook Group, you’ll see the event we’re talking about. It’s going to be a fantastic night, with a silent auction, DJ, raffles, and lots more! So please, if you live in Melbourne, come along and help support our film! We’re planning to raise around $15,000 to help make the best possible trailer we can.","We’ve also been getting a lot of e-mails asking us various questions about the production, and why we’re doing certain things. Over the coming weeks I’ll explain all as to why exactly we are making a trailer, and not just a short film. I’ll also talk at some stage about our marketing strategies, and how we think we can actually achieve in making Sakooz a commercial success.","Ok… That’s about all I’ve got time for tonight! I need to start getting ready for a weekend of extensive camera tests and potentially heated discussions about how we intend to film the trailer, etc. I leave you today, with some photos of the week that was. Have a great weekend readers! And thanks to everyone who has sent us e-mails of support and encouragement! Already this blog is getting a massive number of hits, so thank you! But also, please tell your friends about it – as the more the merrier!","Sakooz Auditions Sakooz Auditions"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"everything-is-going-exactly-according-to-plan","l":"Everything is going exactly according to plan…","p":["Ok, so there may be a slight hint of sarcasm in the title for today. Unfortunately everything is not going exactly according to plan – but it’s not a complete disaster either! Yet – anyway! Nah, I’m kidding. We’re seriously heading in the right direction – a lot slower than we hoped, but on course none-the-less.","Boy, oh, boy! What a week it’s been! On Tuesday it was back to uni for our production class. We had a discussion on post production, which was actually really helpful for us. Of course, once class was over it was just back to work – replying to e-mails, working on the script, completing documentation, drawing up costume designs, researching, the list goes on! Looking back in my diary, the “to-do list” which came out of Tuesday completely filled the page from top to bottom, and there was even righting horizontal on the page. So many things to do – so little time!","Then Wednesday it was all about meetings! I had to get up really early to pick up Anli, and Isaac (we all live on different corners of the globe!), and off we headed to having a meeting with Frank Strangio, an extremely talented and well respected composer. Rather than write for hours about all the amazing stuff Frank has done in the past, it’s probably best if you just check out his website. Apparently it’s a bit out-of-date (as he’s done heaps more in recent times), but it still gives you a very good idea of just how talented and remarkable this bloke really is! We spent nearly two and a half hours in his beautiful studio just chatting about each others projects. He’s one of the most lovely people I’ve ever had the pleasure of meeting – and I mean this in all honesty. He has such a passion for film making, and the industry – it’s very inspiring! I’m sure we’ll be talking much more about Frank over the next few months on this blog!","After meeting with Frank, it was off to Digital Pictures to talk about all things post! At this stage, we are looking at shooting the Sakooz trailer on Super 16mm using an ARRI SRII film camera – so we need to somehow get the footage from film to our editing system. This is done through a process called telecine. For those that have never been to Digital Pictures – the facilities are incredible and very much world class. The staff are fantastic, and they all genuinely got excited about our project.","Then it was off to Soundfirm– another leader in their field. Once again, the staff are not only the very best at what they do, but extremely friendly, and excited about what we are trying to achieve.","In an effort to jam as much as we possibly could in the one day, we then headed off to Federation Square to attend a special industry forum called MINDSHIFT, run by Film Victoria. Although it was a very interesting discussion – and lots of good points were raised, the fact that there wasn’t any young up-and-coming film makers on the board, nor was there any full-time script writers, was kind of a disappointment as the purpose of the event was to talk about the future of the industry, and about the lack of good ideas and concepts coming out of Victoria.","So, after a very busy day, it was time to head home for a couple of hours sleep and get ready for another day of auditions! Thursday brought with it another 18 auditions… Like previous days, there was an amazing array of different talents! There a few people that you knew straight away, when they walked in the room, that they could just play their chosen part. It’s a fantastic feeling to know that this up-and-coming actor could one day be the next Hollywood icon! After a very long day, and another night of very little sleep, it was Friday…","After some great acting workshops at uni, we headed off to have a meeting with Chris and Tim – our animatronic gurus. After a lengthy discussion at a pub in Richmond (next to Barnes), we finally got to a point were the duo are ready to actually start making something! Exciting times!","Friday night was set aside to finally catch up again with our own family and friends. However, even when we decided to have a break from one another – for just a night – we still end up running into one another! Out of all the venues in all of Melbourne, amazingly I still ended up running into Isaac completely randomly. I guess after spending two weeks together stuck in the same hotel room in Hong Kong, we are just drawn together whenever the alcohol is flowing – weird! Eventually, Friday became Saturday. We continued work in the comfort of our own homes, and Saturday soon become today – Sunday!","What was on today? Well, despite the fact that it was mothers day – we had auditions from 9:00am to 5:30pm! Sorry mums! As always, we had a great mix of different peoples, auditioning for different roles. For some reason, we also had a large amount of people travel from interstate today – some from Perth, others from Brisbane, and a couple from Sydney! It’s absolutely terrific that people get so excited about Sakooz, that they are willing to fly down to Melbourne, at their own expense, just to attend a half hour audition. I’ve been thinking a lot about why people actually do this – I mean, seriously, it’s only an unpaid student film after all! But, I guess, at the end of the day, you never know where one of these unpaid jobs may lead. In our case, we are confident that we’re going to get Sakooz “off the ground”, into a feature film and onto theatre screens world wide. In fact, we’re almost certain – it’s just a matter of when! So I guess, keeping this in mind, auditioning for a freebie gig could lead to something big and amazing. It’s probably worth the risk! So, a MASSIVE thank you to everyone that flew in today to audition! And I guess, at the end of the day, I’d personally be more than happy to fly to New Zealand to work for free on any Peter Jackson projects! But yeah, I guess we’re not exactly Peter Jackson… yet!","So anyway, I must be off! Since I started writing, my computer has already beeped about fifteen times – signifying fifteen e-mails to read and reply to. The fun never ends! And I leave you with some snap shots, of the auditions from today… Enjoy!","Sakooz Auditions Sakooz Auditions","Auditions Meetings Photos Post Production"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"zhan-gu--the-drummer","l":"Zhan. Gu / The Drummer","p":["Not to be confused with Yang Chuan’s 1980 film, also set in Hong Kong and as of the same English translation, Kenneth Bi’s “Zhan. Gu (The Drummer)” is his third feature film (despite popular belief, as his first feature film, “A Small Miracle” only received a straight to video release). Nominated for the Sundance Grand Jury Prize, this film is the first from Hong Kong and Taiwan to be selected for competition in the festival, and is already gaining positives reviews all around the world, no doubt helped by Tony Leung Ka Fai receiving the “best supporting actor” award at Taiwan’s highly acclaimed Golden Horse Film Festival. However, the film is not without its critics – with many describing it as “ill-conceived” and “unconvincing”.","The Drummer tells the story of Sid, a pompous drummer in a rock band by night, and an insufferable pain during the day, played by Jaycee Chan – the son of one of Hong Kong’s greatest talents, Jackie Chan.","After eyeing off a beautiful woman during a sold out gig, Sid ends up sleeping with Carmen (played by Hong Kong pop sensation, Yumiko Cheng Hei-Yi), despite knowing that she’s having a relationship with Stephen Ma (Kenneth Tsang) – a triad kingpin. However, even when Sid is caught messing around with Carmen in a hotel hot tub by a very infuriated Mr. Ma – accompanied by his nasty looking henchmen – Sid just yells at the top of his voice, “You have to deal with my father if you hurt me”.","However, even though Sid’s father, Kwan (played by a typecast Tony Leung Ka Fai) is also a triad leader, unlike Ma, he doesn’t wear a suit – and in these underground societies, a suit signifies a lot more power than those who wear gold chains. Incidentally, Kwan also owes Ma from a previous triad-related encounter, and is suddenly thrown into an incredibly difficult situation, as Ma wants Sid’s hands – quite literally. Unfortunately for Sid, his usual “get out of jail card” is of no use this time round, and ends up taking refuge in his sister’s veterinarian clinic. But he’s soon discovered when he stumbles out of hiding to his sister’s rescue, after Kwan goes mental and starts bashing his daughter and destroying her practice. Despite objections from the rest of his gang – who would much rather Kwan hand his sons fingers and palms over to Ma for the good of the team – Kwan decides to sneak Sid out of the country to Taiwan, while he tries to smooth things over in Hong Kong.","Accompanied by his official triad babysitter Chiu (Roy Cheung), Sid finds himself stuck in a beautiful Taiwanese town, with nothing to do. Chiu even resorts to joining a small adult school where they teach you how to be a “better person”. However, one morning Sid is awaken by the distant sound of drumming, coming from the nearby mountain. Together, Sid and Chiu hike up hill to investigate, and come across a group of Zen Drummers. Instantly, Sid is enchanted by their powerful rhythmic drumming, and he entices them to allow him to audition, despite Chiu’s prior objections. Put head to head with the youngest group member, a fiery and stunning young lady called Hong Dou (Angelica Lee), who Sid has already had an altercation with back in town, he soon gets bored of following her lead. Holding up the audition, while he rearranges several other drums around him, he then decides to improvise, smashing them as if they were a drum kit and he was back at home in a dingy nightclub. Despite the noise pollution, the group decides to let Sid join (much to Hong Dou’s disgust), supposedly because he has talent, but more probably because they want to teach him a lesson in humility.","He moves up to the mountains to receive his drumming training, but soon realises that it’s not all fun and games. Before he can put stick to canvas, he must earn their respect and learn to “drum without drumming”. Following along the same lines to movies such as “The Karate Kid”, Sid also endures several “wax on wax off” moments, as he learns virtues like patience, discipline, hard work and perseverance from his wise and patient teachers.","This section of the film, as Sid truly become at one with himself and the world around him, is truly beautiful. The cinematography is stunning, despite the fact that it’s Sam Koa’s first time in the role of director of photography – although, thanks to a picturesque location, it would have been very hard to mess up. Chan’s acting is impressive, especially during his character’s spiritual transformation, and he certainly proves his come a long way since his debut on “Twins Effect 2”.","However, once Sid finally becomes “one with the moment” and masters the art of Zen drumming, the movie takes, what most critics describe as a turn for the worst. Leaving the breathtaking scenery of the Taiwanese mountains, the film heads back to pollution filled Hong Kong, for clashes with treacherous triads and ham-handed moralizing.","However, despite the many complaints from reviewers and film critics, I for one personally agree with the directors choices. Although there is a good argument that this film could have really be made into two completely separate films – one a film about triads in Hong Kong, and another about Zen drummers – by combining the two very different worlds together in the one motion pictures creates a very unique piece of work. Although the differences between the two worlds are almost jarring, this adds to the impact to the film, in what I believe is a positive way. In essence this is a very simple coming of age story, of an impatient youth, and in many ways a lot of the plot and subplots are almost clichéd in nature. However, by dramatically contrasting the fast paced and dangerous Hong Kong streets with the serenity of the Taiwan mountains, the director has created a whole bunch of visual and aural metaphors, which help add many extra layers of meaning onto the quite simple framework.","But one of the biggest things going for this film is the score by Andre Matthias, and the sound design by Du-Che Tu. When viewed in a surround sound environment, the scenes with the Zen drumming are just absolutely spectacular – the beautiful and organic sound just floats all around you. But then in more dramatic scenes, the score (which also features a lot of unique drum sounds) builds dramatically in tension to reveal a whole orchestral score. Obviously the fact that the director has actually won several awards for his composing work on previous films has meant that he put a lot of importance into getting the sound elements of this film just perfect. Continuing to follow the same path as past films, Kenneth Bi also took on the roll of editor for The Drummer – he really is the kind of director who likes to retain absolute creative control over all elements of his production.","Internationally speaking, this movie should do quite well for several reasons. Firstly, it stars Jackie Chan’s son – and for this reason alone, it will draw a big Western crowd. But by also merging two very visually strong and bold worlds together (the land of the gangsters and the land of the Zen drummers, high up in the mountains), the audience is really taken on a journey of stunning proportions. Forgetting about the story for just a second – the sound design and cinematography alone is reason enough to watch this film. That said, I still don’t agree that it was necessarily a poor script (as some critics have suggested – although notably a lot of them were actually from Hong Kong) – I just think that maybe the director decided to go down an unconventional route when it came time to making the film. And of course, the U-Theatre fans will obviously come flocking to the theatres to see these amazing drummers up there on the big screen.","In conclusion, The Drummer is an amazingly beautiful film – with visuals that easily rival the very best BBC documentaries and Hollywood blockbusters such as Lord of the Rings. However, the highlight of this film is by far the music and the drumming. The soundscape that is created by the filmmakers is truly incredible. It’s also great to see Jackie Chan’s son up there on the big screen – as well as a host of other fantastic actors. Although the script may not be as tight and exciting as some might have liked – it really doesn’t matter. You have to sit down in the theatre, relax, and become at one with the drumming…"]},{"l":"References","p":["Bi, K (2007), Zhan. gu, DVD, Kenbiroli Films, Hong Kong.","Making Of, DVD (Special Feature), Kenbiroli Films, Hong Kong.","Zhan.

You’re on candid camera!","p":["It’s extremely hard to believe it’s already been four days since I last updated this blog! Where the hell does time go? No really – I honestly want to know! So what’s been happening since my last message, well, quite a lot! Last Saturday we had more auditions – eighteen of them to be precise. Everything went smoothly, and there was some great talent in the mix! On Sunday we met up with Ben Hidalgo – our amazing DOP for the Sakooz project. We talked all things light, around a coffee table in Prahran, and started to put together a game plan for this epic adventure. Then on Monday is was back to uni, and a meeting with another Chris – an animatronics expert that studied at the VCA. After another discussion around the coffee table, and some more discussions and planning – we walked away a lot more confident than what we were on Friday. Everything seems to be heading in the right direction. Our DOP is the best (and I honestly mean it), so we have little to worry about in terms of that department. And now with another Chris on the team – we’ve got animatronics covered. So despite all odds – at the moment, we appear to be winning the war. Of course it’s still very early stages, and there are a lot more battles to go… Money is probably one of the biggest issues. Oh, if you’re rich, and have some cash to spare – then get in touch with us!

Thing is, we are absolutely flat out! And to make matters worse, our whole team seems to be getting ill in one way, shape or form! Isaac has bronchitis. David has tonsillitis. Caithlin is having surgery on her back. And Anli has been sick now with some kind of bug for the past couple of weeks. I just haven’t been sleeping… pretty much at all, so although I may not be ill, yet, I still look a little worse for wear!","So anyway, illness’ aside – what have we been doing since last Saturday? Why haven’t we been sleeping? Why are we so stressed? One simple answer – casting! We started advertising early in the week, and since then it’s really been “all hands on deck”! We had a MASSIVE response – I’m generally getting around 60+ e-mails a day from people all over Australia. To be perfectly honest, we’re really surprised! We knew our concept was pretty unique and exciting, but we had no idea people would be willing to fly interstate (at their OWN expensive) just to attend a half an hour audition! It’s all been really exciting! We had our first auditions yesterday (as it’s now after mid-night), and it all went very smooth considering Isaac’s lovely cough. We did plan to get some behind the scenes footage, but unfortunately, we just ran out of time. We really need to get someone on board to just take care of all our behind the scenes stuff! Anyone interested? Well, if you’re one of the few people who actually read this, and you are interested in documenting this – lets face it – AMAZING adventure, then get in touch!","So what else has been happening? Well, the search continues for costume designers/builders for our Pinky character. So far we’ve had quotes ranging from $60,000 – $3,000. We’ve been in touch with so many different costumes companies, it’s been incredible.","We’ve also been hunting down crew, further developing the feature film concept, working on the trailer script, doing budgets, schedules, and generally sending and replying to HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of e-mails each day, not to mention many, many phone calls and SMS’. And it never stops. However, at least we’re not alone – believe it or not, but when we put up our first online ad for casting at 3:00 in the morning, we had a reply by 3:30 am! Seems actors don’t sleep either…","So what’s in store for the next few days? More auditions! Meetings with various post production houses, costume design companies, composers, crew, etc. Script sessions and internal production meetings. Really – it just never stops. And it’s not going to stop for a while – we have so much work to do over the next couple of months (and of course, years).","So stay tuned! Lots more exciting things to come! We’ll TRY and get around to recording some video footage at our auditions on Saturday and post it up here on the blog, or at least some photos so you can see how lovely we all look.","Over the next few weeks we’ll also start posting up information on the production and the story on this blog, as well as some of our development documentation and drawings, so you can start to piece together how this whole nightmare came to be. Lots of things planned – and we WILL actually get around to it at some stage.","Ok… I’ve now got 45 unread e-mails sitting in my inbox.

What kind of crazy nut-case film are we trying to bring to life? Well, a quite a big one actually. At the end of last year we were worked on a documentary called “Superb Menura”. It was a major step up from our previous 16mm short, “Happy Sundaes”. And whilst we were busy filming doco footage, and getting surround sound recordings at absolutely crazy hours of the night, we were always plotting and planning for what we would do this year.","One thing that I’ve always wanted to do, ever since working on the BBC Kids show “ Tweenies“, is create a movie about a bunch of kids show characters that are actually aliens. And so we started work on “TV Tubsters” – a full length feature film concept. However, due to the fact that our doco took over our lives for a lengthy period of time, the first story outline wasn’t completed until the start of November. It was also hopeless and massively incomplete. Then throughout November and December we continued, as a team to build upon the general outline. It grew and evolved. Characters were introduced, and then destroyed. Plot outlines grew in size. What started out as a 1000 word outline became a 2000 word outline, and then 4000 word outline. Ideas were accepted, and rejected. Christmas and New Years came and went. Then in the new year, despite our better judgement, we decided to stop trying to develop the story as a team, and sent Isaac to work solo on a first draft of the script. While he went absolutely crazy writing like a mad man, the rest of the time started organising all the pre-production elements – despite the fact that we didn’t have a completed script. After a few weeks or writing it became very clear that we were never going to pull off a feature film script in the time that we had. As heart breaking as this reality was, we decided to press on writing the script, and actually produce a teaser/trailer this year to use as a promotional tool to get the funding required to get the feature film script off the ground the following year. Everything continued along slowly but smoothly. The script grew in size and complexity.","And then Anli, Isaac and myself went to Hong Kong for the International Film Festival. We all had an amazing time – saw lots of great films, and also got to see all the sights and sounds. But when we came back, after some quite intensive script sessions, we came to the conclusion that we were in the world of shit. Because Isaac was writing solo, the idea was morphing, re-shaping and changing – which is fine, as it was definitely turning into a really fantastic script – however, Anli and myself just weren’t involved enough. We didn’t really know the characters on the page – nor could we relate to a lot of events that were taking place. This normally wouldn’t be a problem, as the writer could have continued to do his or her thing, and after a few rewrites, the director could then bring the script to life in their own special way. But because we’re really building this film “as a team” from scratch, everyone needed to be across everything.","We learnt a valuable lesson – in our case, we needed to do everything as a team to achieve the best results in the given timetable. Sure, if we had years to write the script that Isaac could have taken the first pass, then we could discuss it, make changes, move on to the next draft and continue along like that. We also made the fatal mistake of tackling the first draft without a clear plan of attack. We had a beginning and a middle, but no end. I don’t think you should start writing a draft without any idea of what direction you want the film to go.","So, despite having written thousands and thousands of words already, we made the tough decision to go back to the start, and revisit the story from line one. It was tough. We spent several weeks going back to basics and seriously reviewing all our decisions. What’s the story about? Who’s story is it? We started re-reading scriptwriting books, and re-visiting fantastic movies from the past. We spent a lot of time locked in confined spaces, forced to just put pen to paper and come up with something of value. Slowly but surely, things started falling into place.","Now it’s time to step into the present. Where are we up to now? What’s going on? Well, the good news is that we have a completed story outline – it has a very well defined beginning, middle and end. The characters have been completely built from the ground up, and we basically know everything there is to know about them. We’ve started work on the teaser/trailer script (based on the story outline) and everything is heading in the right direction. Costume design is under way, and next week we start meeting up with our Director of Photography, and other key crew members to start working out how exactly we’re going to pull this off.","This really isn’t the right way to make a movie. You shouldn’t really “force” a script out of people – although it seemed to work. Ideally, we would have loved to have spent two of three years developing the feature film script, spent all of last year getting funding, and then actually made the feature film this year. But that just didn’t happen. So the plan is, to create the basis for a feature film concept NOW, produce and shoot a teaser/trailer this year (to mainly use as a promotional tool), and at the same time start writing the 1st draft of the full length feature film so that it’s ready for a re-write later in the year. The aim is to have a completed teaser/trailer, as well as a feature film script, promotional website, and extensive marketing tools all in operation by the end of the year. Can we pull this off? Only time will tell…","But by far the most frequent question we get asked, is why are we “jumping the queue” and working on a feature film now? Seeing as we’re studying 3rd year university – why not just produce an amazing short film? If it’s really good then we’ll get into all kind of fantastic International festivals, and who knows were we’ll end up… Well, that all very well and good, and sure it works for some people, but we don’t want to head down that route. Why make shorts when you can make a feature? We’ve very much of the opinion that if you want to do something, then just get out there and do it. I’m personally a huge fan of Peter Jackson – despite all the limitations, he just pushed every boundary and made amazing films. Sure, he made a hell of a lot of short films before he started work on the bigger features – but so have we. Although Happy Sundaes is the first narrative film under the latenite banner, individually, we’ve all worked on well over one hundred short films, video clips, television commercials, low-budget/independent and professional feature films, etc.","Don’t take me the wrong way, we haven’t learnt everything – and we’re by no means experts when it comes to film making. But, we think, for better or for worse, we’re ready for the next step. It’s time to make a feature film! Unfortunately it’s going to take a bit longer than we originally hoped (as we’re making the teaser/trailer before the full length feature this time round), but that’s all part of the fun.","So that’s the current situation! It hasn’t been an easy ride so far. Ignoring all the script/story problems, we’ve also had many other unavoidable set backs: marriage break-ups, couples break-ups, team member partings, sickness, car crashes… the list goes on. But we’re all alive (although you probably wouldn’t think it by looking), and feeling great about the project thus far! It’s not going to be easy – but that should at least mean that this blog will be half interesting…","As Chris Jones always says, Onward & Upward!","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"lets-start-at-the-very-beginning","l":"Let’s start at the very beginning…","p":["Aren’t there already enough blogs on the web? I’m mean seriously, if you type the word “blog” into Google, you get well over two BILLION results. Why on earth would we want to start another one? There’s already thousands of film making blogs scattered around the place… So what’s the deal?","Well firstly, I must say that I’m a huge fan of them. Take for example HD For Indies. Written by Mike Curtis, a film post production and workflow guru, this site dedicated to providing independent film-makers with all the latest information on affordable digital technology. He’s now moving a lot of his new content over to the ProVideo Coalition– a fantastic new site which brings together the industry’s best writers, bloggers and video gurus under one website. Because technology changes so rapidly, and new products hit the market quicker than ever before, site’s like Mike’s help keep you in the loop. And because it’s written from his point of view – not just a whole heap of marketing crap – it helps answer a lot of questions and also helps make you question the way you think about new technology.","And then there’s blog like Stu Maschwitz’s, ProLost. Writer of one of my all time favourite tech books, The DV Rebel’s Guide. co-founder of The Orphanage(one of the best visual effects and production companies in the world), ex-employee of George Lucas’ Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM), creator of the award-winning Magic Bullet software and overall nice guy – Stu’s blog is jam packed with technical wonders. If you’re into After Effects, then you really have to take a walk around through his blog.","But my favourite blog at the moment has got to be Chris Jones’. Founder of Living Spirit, and author of the Guerilla Film Makers Book series – this guy is an absolute low-budget film-making legend! His books are priceless (I have all of them sitting in front of me as I type), and his blog (which is currently following him while he puts together a short film called Gone Fishing), is so easy to read, so jam packed with useful hints and information, and so interesting, it’s amazing.","So anyway, it’s pretty clear that I like blogs. But why start up one for latenite films? Well, mainly because film making is all about community and teamwork. It’s all about sharing information – and what better way to do that than by documenting everything we do, and publishing it free of charge on our website? Just like Chris Jones site, Peter Jackson’s various production diaries (such as Kong Is King), and Melbourne own Gravediggers Blog, we hope to have a site that people will occasionally have a read through, to not only see how we’re going, but to also learn about film-making through our experiences and mistakes. Although the best way to learn about movie making is by actually getting out there and making films, in your down time, it’s always nice to read up on how others have gone about things. And secondly, for more selfish reasons, we are putting up this blog so that we can actually keep track of what we’ve done in the past! Even now, there are so many times when we’ve been working non-stop without sleep for a couple of weeks, and we completely loose track of what happened and in which order. Film making is so intense and takes up so much of your life and time, that it’s so easy to just loose large chunks of time in the abyss. So hopefully, this blog will help us keep a diary of what we’ve done and when we did it so that when we’re grumpy (ok… even grumpier) old men and woman, we have some record of the past (because lets face it – whatever memory isn’t destroyed by drugs and alcohol, will no doubt be wrecked by our crazy no sleeping, no eating, hard working lifestyle).","So what exactly are we going to put up on this blog? Well, good question! The aim is to just keep it updated with what we’re working on and how it’s all going. We’ll post lots photos and videos were relevant. Basically, we’re after a site that’s very similar to Chris Jones and the Gravediggers site – except we’re a lot more indie, a lot more low budget and a lot less experienced! So this site will probably contain a lot of information that’s REALLY useful to budding student film makers who also don’t have access to huge budgets and fancy gear.","So welcome to the blog! We really hope you enjoy reading through it and learning about all our fun, tears and adventures. Let me rest assure you know – at least this site won’t be boring! With every shoot we do, the stories get more exciting and, let’s face it, scary, so who knows what amazing things will happen this year round!","Stay tuned!","Chris!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Ladri di biciclette","p":["Vittorio De Sica’s ninth film as director, Ladri di biciclette, has been widely cited as one of the finest films ever made and has helped cement the Italian-born actor/writer/director, as one of the world’s most influential and remarkable filmmakers of all time. Released in 1948, The Bicycle Thief, as it was titled in the US (or more accurately “Bicycle Thieves” if you go with the literal translation), is a seemingly simple film that has made and continues to achieve a massive impact on cinema viewers worldwide.","Similar to his earlier work Sciuscià in many ways, Ladri di biciclette is also set in the ravages of post-war Italy, and features non-actors (De Sica cast Lamberto Maggiorani over Cary Grant and Henry Forda because of the way he walked – preferring realism over profile) to tell an unpretentious story about ordinary people struggling in an extremely challenging time where poverty was a dire reality. It’s the tale of Antonio Ricci– just an average man, trying to earn enough money to keep his family alive. Every day he waits outside a government employment agency in Rome alongside fellow unemployed labourers, hoping that there will be a job out there with his name on it. He gets lucky, and is selected for a duty that requires him to hang posters around the city. It’s nothing fancy, but it will earn him enough money for his family to get by. Unfortunately though, this position requires a bicycle – a possession he has previously submitted to a pawn shop to sustain his family’s meagre existence for just a couple more days. Trapped in a helpless situation where he needs a bicycle to get money, but needs money to get to his bicycle, Antonio returns to the pawn shop with his extremely supportive wife Maria by his side, and forfeits one of their family’s last remaining possessions, their matrimonial linen, in order to redeem the bicycle. Now with a bike and a job, things are looking up for Antonio. He’s truly happy for the first time in years – but as the title suggests, it’s going to be far from easy riding.","It takes a little while for one of the “title” characters to make an appearance. There are a few “trick starts”, where you think Antonio’s bicycle is going to be taken away from him, but it isn’t the case. He leaves his bike outside a fortune teller’s house under the supervision of an unidentified local boy, whilst he goes upstairs to find his wife – but the lad is surprisingly trustworthy after all. The suspense rises! Soon enough, the thief makes his big debut on Antonio’s first day on the job. Whilst Antonio is up a ladder gracelessly plastering posters promoting Rita Hayworth’s latest film Gilda around town (an image that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding Antonio, and a constant reminder of his own lowly status) two men are plotting to steal his bicycle. They succeed, and as the stolen bike heads off into the distance, Antonio does everything in his power to try and chase after him, but he has been outsmarted, and his only means of earnings is swiftly lost in an endless sea of nondescript bicycles (a large proportion of which are presumably stolen). He goes to the police – but they are very little help, not appreciating how much the bike means to him and his family’s continued existence – after all, it’s just a bicycle! With nothing more to pawn, and very little chance of obtaining another job, with the help of his completely & utterly devoted son Bruno, and assistance from close friend Baiocco, he is forced to comb the city to try and find the elusive bicycle and bring the thief to justice in order to save not only his pride, but also quite possibly his family from starvation.","He gets close to catching the criminal! Chasing down an old man he spotted talking with the thief, Antonio eventually finds the bandit himself only to discover he’s a pathetic epileptic, just as destitute as the rest of them. Beaten, and aimlessly wondering through the city streets, Antonio finally snaps and in a moment of sheer desperation he dashes to steal a lone bicycle, but is immediately caught. Humiliated, frustrated, and saved from prosecution solely because of the owner’s compassion, in tears, Antonio and his loyal son continue on the uphill journey that is life…","The premise to this film is extremely simple – so much so that the title reveals the whole story line – but as this film clearly demonstrates, even the most unremarkable foundation can result in a masterpiece which forces to the viewer to re-evaluate the way in which they view the world (if only for a minute). This is not so much a story about a man loosing a something important to him and then searching for it, but a tale of hope and despair, loss and redemption (the bicycle is simply a metaphor). It is the honest examination of a person who is torn by moral consequence and responsibility for not only his family, but also himself.","What makes this film stand out from the rest of the contemporary Hollywood films of the time (apart from the fact that it doesn’t conclude with a happy ending), is that De Sica’s tells the story through subtle actions, and sparse words, without the necessity of glittering production values or convoluted editing. But this wasn’t just a creative decision. As with a most of the films that followed during the Italian neorealism movement, there simply wasn’t the money available to use established locations and professional actors. Compromises had to be made, such as using natural lighting, and documentary “run and gun” techniques – a look which well suited the gritty and searing stories they “needed” to tell (as De Sica said himself, “the urge to tell the truth stirred in us”). And although Ladri di biciclette gives the impression of a lack of concern for technical matters to the indiscriminate eye, De Sica planned his work with extreme attention to every infinitesimal detail of camera techniques, mise en scène, musical score and especially characterisation.","Italy was a mess after World War II, and directors such as De Sica decided to produce films such as Sciuscià and Ladri di biciclette, to give the world spectators a glimpse into the harsh conditions and unsympathetic realities of war imposed upon everyday people in everyday settings. Films such as this not only represented a radical break from traditional filmmaking conventions, but also brought a lot of hostile social and political issues to the big screen for the first time. However, these were not documentaries – they were fictional stories, with undaunted honesty and untiring compassion, about the “little people” that the universe has long forgotten about: the paper-hanger who has to sell his nuptial lien to buy a bicycle and the shoeshine boys of Rome. These are stories about life and humanity. Ordinary people trapped in tough situations forced to make real decisions (some of which they’ll no doubt regret), with real emotion, struggling for life and self respect. De Sica doesn’t pretend to offer any answers, but tries to show it as it is in all its imperfect beauty and tear-jerking cruelty using the power of simplicity to drive his point home.","There are many stunning and moving sequences in Ladri di biciclette in which De Sica has carefully and skilfully crafted, designed to make the audience really think about the situations his characters have been place into. With a montage of human faces and thousands of various different bicycle parts (whilst Antonio and Bruno search the open markets for a trace of evidence), De Sica expertly contrasts the world’s apparent abundance with Antonio’s own desperate need, just as he did with the earlier pawn shop scene, slowly panning the camera up a mountain of submitted linens. The goods are all there, but just out of arms reach…","Another powerful visual is when Antonio is interrogating the old man in the Church. Clearly commenting on the role of the Catholic Church during that period, De Sica obviously believes that in a time when recovery of a bicycle means the different between starvation and prosperity, where an old man cares more about what’s to eat than what’s happening around him, the priest’s promises of “soothed spirits” means very little. He pushes this point further when he shows a line of Roman women lining up to spend their last lira on a clairvoyant (having already given up on the good Lord). This is a service that even Antonio resorts to when he completely losses hope, only to be rewarded with metaphoric and cryptic answers – it would seem that no one, not even the all powerful and knowing God, has the answers…","But by far the most memorable scene is that of the restaurant. After an emotional rollercoaster ride, Antonio and Bruno finally get a chance to sit down, eat some real food and forget about their troubles for just a very brief moment. But it’s awfully short-lived! Both are rapidly reminded of their poor social status, when a rich and arrogant child sitting across from Bruno starts eyeing him off in disgust. This is a time when it’s truly man versus the elements. There’s no one to help – it’s every man, woman and child for themselves. The poor versus the rich!","To fund most of his films, De Sica worked as an actor right throughout his 150+ movie career. “All my good films, which I financed myself, made nothing. Only my bad films made money. Money has been my ruin” ( Woman Times Seven is an obvious example). This also goes to show that in order to make an absolutely amazing film you don’t need high paid actors, or a studio space full of expensive lights. With Ladri di biciclette, De Sica had a story he felt he needed the world to know. His openness to form and versatility, allowed him to experiment with untried methods to ensure the technology matched the content and not the other way around. With the assistance of one of the most distinguished and experienced cinematographers in Italy, Carlo Montuori, together they proved that even with natural lighting you can still achieve images that look far more beautiful than some of the garbage coming out of Hollywood. The romantic Italianesque score by Alessandro Cicognini (who went on to do many other well respected Italian films) helps provides real emotional depth in a most subliminal way – as opposed to the emotional manipulation music performs on many mainstream films – truly adding to the magic on screen.","Long before life was beautiful, and only shortly after the city was open, Ladri di biciclette shows that there are no heroes, and that not all criminals are evil; that people are simply human – flawed and corruptible. But it’s not all negative – even in the direst of times, with the right person by your side, you can slog your way through anything…"]},{"i":"references","l":"References:","p":["De Sica, V (1948), Ladri di biciclette, DVD, Compass Film SRL, Italy.","That’s Life!, DVD (Special Feature), Compass Film SRL, Italy.","Thomas Samuels, C 1987, Encountering Directors, Da Capo Pr, New York.","Cheshire, G 2006, Bicycle Thieves, The Criterion Collection, viewed 1st October 2007, http://www.criterion.com/asp/release.asp?id=374eid=522section=essaypage=3","Ladri di biciclette (1948), Internet Movie Database Inc., viewed 1st October 2007, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040522/.","Vittorio De Sica, Internet Movie Database Inc., viewed 1st October 2007, http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001120/.","Wikipedia contributors 2007, Bicycle Thieves, Wikipedia, viewed 1st October 2007, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Thieves","Wikipedia contributors 2007, Vittorio De Sica, Wikipedia, viewed 1st October 2007, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_De_Sica"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days","l":"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days","p":["I must have completely zoned out when I read the description of this film. If I had consciously known it was about an abortion, there is no way in hell I would have gone and seen it. I must have also tuned out when people were talking about this film they’ve seen with a drawn out abortion scene in it. For some reason, I was sure this title referred to a movie about a marriage – but I was completely wrong. Set in the Soviet block during the final days of communism, this is a gritty tale about two female students in Bucharest, one of whom is pregnant. Rather than give birth to the child, she has decided to ask her friend for help in organising an illegal termination. With an extremely limited budget, the girls are forced to call on the services of a dodgy backyard operator, in a hotel room. As I said, this is not the sort of film I’d normally go and see. I hate blood, and medical procedures. The thought of watching a poor and desperate young student go through a risky, prohibited and life threatening procedure in a dirty hotel room gives me the chills. However, this was a really good film. It still scared the hell out of me, and was seriously depressing, moving and hard to watch – but the characters and situations seemed so unfortunately real and the film had such well scripted dialogue, that it’s very hard not to appreciate how great a film this really is. It’s not a complex film – there are only a few key characters and a very simple plot, however it’s incredibly dramatic. Watching a dubious abortion take place was too much for a lot of people – there were several that left the theatre near the start of the movie; they obviously didn’t pay attention to the blurb either. But luckily, because I’m too stubborn, I stayed till the end. Although hard to watch, I felt it was an important movie to stick with for some reason. I think I just really cared about the characters (or at least just Otilia). I never want to watch it again – but I’m glad I made it to the end without fainting."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"a-walk-into-the-sea-danny-williams-and-the-warhol-factory","l":"A Walk into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory","p":["This is a documentary about the mystery disappearance of the Warhol Factory’s Danny Williams in 1966.

It’s a film that sets out to discover what really happened the night he left his car on a cliff face, by looking over never-seen-before footage, including many films Williams made at the Factory, and interviewing friends, family and co-workers, about his past. It’s an interesting insight into a man’s life. Personally, I found it a tad boring – as I didn’t really know much about Williams coming into the film, and the way he was portrayed, meant that I didn’t really care to learn more.

Visually, the film is shot in stunning monochrome, with striking faded, dirty and rough production design. This is a very slow film. We just stick with the grandma as she slowly stumbles around the camp. Everyone in the film seems exhausted. It successfully portrays that war is far from exciting – it’s extremely tough work and essentially soul destroying. That said, it’s not strictly anti-war – it more of an observational piece. Take out of it what you will. Personally, although I respected the acting, directing, cinematography, production design and sound design, I found this film to be too humdrum and long-winded. I fell asleep a couple of times, and didn’t really pay that much attention when I was actually awake.

The whole film has been designed to look as if it’s done in a single steady cam take, which gives you a very painstaking detailed view of every single thing that happens in the story. It’s made to look as if it’s playing out in real time – and it works. The start seems a tad slow – as we watch Chris, the main character prepare, but things quickly speed up as the other characters are introduced. When the truth about the new boyfriend is reveal tension soon hits an all time high. At first I thought the acting was pretty average – the dialogue seemed very unnatural. However, I soon came to the realisation that in this situation, this is how these people would have really talked. The sound design was pretty average – it felt as if a whole lot of stock standard “outdoor sounds” were playing in repeat mode. The cinematography was basic – yet impressive, if only because it was using natural lighting, and yet you never saw a stray boom or crew shadow. This film was pretty good.

I remember watching an interview with David Lynch a couple of months back and thinking, “this guy is an idiot”. He completely ignored the intelligent Italian interviewer, claiming he couldn’t understand him, despite the fact that the TV host spoke better English than Lynch. This movie was horrible. The only problem is that I feel a little bit guilty bagging the crap out of it because I had to leave early and haven’t actually seen the end. But that’s Lynch’s fault as well! The film ran for way too long – so long that it went well past the departure time of the last train out of the city, much to my dismay. Then again, what I did see was dreadful, so there was no real way it could have recovered itself. This film was obviously just made to be different and challenge its viewers. It was certainly different – but not in a good way. The photography was uncomfortable with extreme close ups and badly framed images. The editing was sometimes predictable but mostly seemingly random and without real motive. A lot of the shots were out of focus for no particular reason. Everything about this film was random and completely over the top. From rabbits speaking gibberish to prostitutes singing and dancing – this film really had it all. But it was really boring to watch. It did have some funny moments and some good characters. I really loved the producer character as he tried to collect money from crew in charity. The lead lady was acted incredibly well – she must have gone through hell making this film. But the film itself, and admittedly I haven’t seen the end – was just a complete and utter waste of time. I’m sure some boring film geek could make up reasons for why every shot was there, but I honestly think this was just a lot stuff thrown on paper for just the hell of it.

He’s instantly attracted to her, and when she suggests that he should come back with her to a self-sufficient community far away, “where no one gets old” and she lives with her husband Charlie Chaplin, daughter Shirley Temple, plus a host of other phoney celebrities, he decides to pack up and come along for the ride. The film is primarily about a three way relationship between Michael, Marilyn and Charlie and their crazy lifestyle. However, it also follows a separate and completely unrelated story about nuns jumping out of planes and surviving. It’s almost like watching a feature film on the TV and having strange ads in between. This film is very bizarre, but as the characters are all so fascinating, the film really hooks you in. It’s not a comedy in the traditional sense – although there are some funny moments. There is a lot of drama and heartache, as we watch these unusual characters go about their strange existence. To be honest, I’m not sure if I understood “the bigger picture” of this film – or even if there was a common theme throughout the whole film.

He forces his daughter to play the piano, not allowing her to play her own thing as well as forcing both his children to run for quite a distance to ensure they keep healthy. His persistence turns to violence if they don’t play by his rules. This is a tale about two siblings who eventually team together, as brother and sister should, to overcome their fears and obstacles. Some of the acting in this film seemed a little bit suspect; although it’s hard to tell if that was due to bad acting, or whether the characters would actually be like that in a real world situation.

This is a really exciting film, with some very fascinating concepts, as well as some great and exceptionally funny dialogue. The relationship between the two children, whom have never met before, and are not related by blood, is very intriguing as they become closer and closer. The lead character is fantastic. She’s very unpredictable – one minute she’s the perfect spy, and you’re confident she could kill anyone, and the next you realise that she’s still human – and can make mistakes. Although there is a lot of suspense and action right throughout the film, the film also strongly focuses on the three main characters and their relationships together. I really enjoyed this film – it was very exciting and surprisingly funny."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Advantage","p":["This is a truly fantastic short film about a man and women who stumble home drunk, after an obviously fun and alcohol filled night. Everything is going to plan for the two, as they enter an unlocked tennis court (after taking of their shoes as per the sign) and start making out passionately, until the lights turn on and all hell brakes loose. This film has a killer punch line and a completely unpredictable little twist. The sound design and musical score is fantastic – and is absolutely terrifying in sections. The acting is fantastic – you really love these characters even though this is a short film. The script and concept, although simple, is extremely effective. The visual effects are terrific, and are another stand out of the film. Overall, this is an amazingly faultless film and is truly entertaining."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Black Sheep","p":["Essentially this is a New Zealand film about a whole lot of mutant sheep that go on a rampage to try and kill everyone, due to a generic engineering experiment going horribly wrong. It’s tremendously funny, and gives the audience exactly what they want – sheep killing people. The visual effects are fantastic, and are so real that they’re funny. To be honest, I don’t know what else to write. It’s a lot of sheep killing people – nothing more, nothing less! It’s completely mad, and very fun! Everything is tongue in cheek. The story isn’t hugely complex, or that well written, but it doesn’t really matter. No one really cares about these things when there’s some sheep killing to be had! Very sick – very funny!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Bug","p":["Set mainly in a single location, Bug is an American horror/thriller essentially about two people who believe bugs are invading their home and their bodies. An exceptionally strange, yet pleasant man is brought along to a woman’s hotel room, and despite all odds, the two quickly become friends. Basically, the woman is lonely, and this man actually listens to her and talks to her as a normal human being. The man obviously has a few loose screws, and convinces the lady of all kinds of weird and absolutely crazy things – mainly revolving around information transmitting bugs. This is a seriously strange movie. It builds up as this very scary and ghastly horror film, but ends up being more silly and funny than anything else. It does have some very gory and gruesome movements, but even they are so over-the-top, that you can’t help but laugh. The film introduces several characters into the story – the girls best friend, and ex-husband, however they really only play minor roles. This is mainly a film about a guy and a girl, and one insane person can make another sane person crazy! The cinematography and set design is fantastic! Despite the fact that there was really only one location, it was never visually boring – in fact it was the polar opposite. Towards the end of the film, when everyone was pretty much raving mad, the whole hotel suite was covered in aluminium foil – which looked absolutely magnificent! The sound design was also noteworthy – surround sound was used to great effect. It was an entertaining film I must admit – it was never dull or boring – however, it was just a little too weird and over-the-top. I was expecting this very serious, very dark and very scary film, and instead I got this strangely humorous and very sick thing instead. The female lead was acted very well, despite the eccentric script. I honestly don’t know what to make of this film. I don’t exactly know what it was trying to be. It certainly wasn’t a horror film in the traditional sense. And it wasn’t an all-out comedy by any stretch of the imagination. I really like the concept – your brain convincing you that bugs are everywhere – however, this film was just a little too odd for me. Never-the-less, it kept you interested, and will no doubt be a good discussion point once the film festival is over."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Cages","p":["I went into this film, just purely out of luck. I had a space free, and this film seemed the best out of the bunch in that timeslot. Luck was on my side this time, as Cages is a truly fantastic Belgium film, and is up there in my list of favourite films so far at the festival. The film opens by introducing Eve and Damien – two people who are obviously both passionately in love. Eve is a ambulance medic, who spends her work hours saving lives. Damien runs an unusual pub called The Zoo, where they host an annual content for the best animal noise. Their world is turned completely up-side-down when Eve is involved in an accident whilst at work, which results in her loosing her ability to speak. The silence soon becomes too much for Damien, and their relationship is seriously put to the test. He starts secretly seeing someone else. When their relationship is on the verge of suffocation, Eve takes drastic action, and in desperation to hang onto Damien she takes him prisoner – locking him up in his own home. This is an absolute thriller of a film, with some many things that are just completely unexpected. When the film looks as if it’s heading in one direction, it quickly surprises you and heads off somewhere else. From the moment the film starts, I feel in love with Eve. I think it was something about her eyes. She’s an amazing actor; her ability to say so much with no auditable words is truly incredible. The actor who played Damien was also spot on, although you can’t help but to feel strongly against his character as Eve is clearly the “good guy” despite her shady methods. This is also a really bizarre film – the animal mimicking show is seriously out there. The cinematography is fantastic – especially during these scenes. Some of the crane/helicopter shots of Eve and Damien on the hill overlooking the ocean are also breathtaking. The sound design was marvellous and did a great job and manipulating the audience’s perceptions. The blend between musical score, sound effects and live action was also incredible. I really loved the audio in one of the opening scenes, when the music suddenly dissipated, to reveal the sound of Eve performing CPR. The transition was great. I really enjoyed this film but there were some uncomfortable scenes – at one stage Eve pretty much rapes her husband, which seriously pushes her “good guy” status. This film was completely not what I expected – even when I was watching it, I kept thinking I had it all figured out, only to be proven seriously wrong. I find it really hard to fault this film. It’s an incredibly unique film, with a great script, executed perfectly."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"catch fish","p":["This is a film about a reclusive Chinese harp player who purchases a dead fish from a sexy lady at a seafood market, places it in his bath and lets his imagination run wild. This is a typical VCA film – very arty, with a rather unclear message. The cinematography and sound design are good – although they are pretty much like every other VCA film of this variety. To be perfectly honest, I don’t like this type of film. It’s just all a bit too weird for me."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Clean Linen","p":["A New Zealand film, Clean Linen is a peculiar film about two children who spend their days doing chores around the house and secretly watching their father’s pornography video collection. When they are caught by their mother, things are a bit heated in the house. Despite the fact that this was an interesting film to watch, I think I may have missed the point. I didn’t really get what the message behind the film was. None of the acting seemed that terrific, although there wasn’t much dialogue or action. The cinematography was noteworthy, with some very nice visuals of the house. Overall, this was a slightly entertaining piece – although not really my cup of tea."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Crossbow","p":["This is a fantastic Australian film narrated by a teenager who tells a story from the past, about his neighbours – a similarly aged boy, with a Bogan father and a sexy mother that everyone wants to sleep with (especially the narrator himself). Told from the perspective of the narrator, this is a story of a confused boy, surrounded by sex and drugs, with no love in sight. The parents are always having sex (in easy hearing distance of their unfortunate child), and are constantly throwing huge parties, with all their Bogan friends. Things turn nasty with the cops turn up to one of the usual afternoon drinks, and the boy greets the cops with a crossbow. The acting in this film is superb, but what’s even more impressive is the narration. The film is gritty in style, with a very real suburban feel. You never quite know where the film is heading, or whether it going to end up happy or sad – it’s unpredictable and very well written. It’s a very cleaver concept that is executed perfectly."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Day Watch","p":["I’ve never seen the first instalment of this Russian trilogy before, so maybe I’ve missed a lot of the back story to the Matrix-like film, Day Watch. Essentially, it’s a film about an age old battle between good vs. evil – light vs. dark. Anton (from the light side) wrestles with his loyalty to his dark-sided son and his loyalty to the Night Watch team (the good guys). Set in modern day Moscow, when vampires belonging to the Dark side start mysteriously being killed, and Anton is framed for their murders, he must forget about saving his son from the clutches of the baddies, and try and escape the Day Watch, which is looking for his blood. This is an ultra-modern film, with some amazing special effects. The computer generated landscapes are breathtaking, and the epic battles easily rival those of movies such as Lord of the Rings. Although the film is spoken in Russian, the subtitles are perhaps the highlight of the film. Unlike traditional subtitles, these ones interact with the action of the film, and help to propel the story along. The amazing use of type would make any typography teacher go bananas. There were some jokes throughout the film, that I think were “in jokes” – either referencing to previous films, or very specifically Russian jokes. However, there were plenty of moments for new-to-the-series viewers to enjoy. There was also perhaps the most amazing fast car sequence I’ve ever seen – although all visual effects, it was really impressive to see a car slide so unnaturally around corners, fly effortlessly through the air, drive around the walls of a building, smash through the window, and then hoon around the hallways. The look of the film was very unique, very modern, very bold and very prominent. It looked like a real action movie. The sound design was also really impressive – we great use of surround sound, especially when viewed in a big venue like The Regent. I must say, even without seeing the previous film, this is a really standout movie at the film festival – if only for the special effects alone."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"everythings-gone-green","l":"Everything’s Gone Green","p":["I actually stumbled into this film by accident, as the many days of movie watching finally took a toll on my brain and logical thinking. However, it was a great mistake to make as Everything’s Gone Green is a really good film. This is a very Garden State-like film about a guy called Ryan. In one unfortunate day, he is dumped by his girlfriend, kicked out of his house, fired from his job, told his family has won the lottery, and then finds out it’s a mistake. Nothing seems to be going right for the poor man. Things start to look up when, by chance he meets a beautiful film set-dresser named Ming, at the site of a dead whale on a beach. But, as fate would have it, Ming is already dating a shady entrepreneur named Bryce. Things start to look up for young Ryan when he finds himself a job at the National Lottery Corporation, and his brother hooks him up with a fantastic apartment. When Bryce proposes a bizarre money-laundering scheme, Ryan ignores his ethics, signs up and is on the fast track to wealth. After all, everyone is doing something dodgy to make a living! Even his apparently innocent parents are selling dope to make a lot of cash quickly. This is a very light hearted comical critique of our notions of corruption and success. It has some pure gold moments in it. The cast is fantastic – there is some great chemistry between Ryan and Ming, as well as an interesting four way relationship when you include Bryce and Ming’s traditionally Chinese mother. Ryan’s best friend, parents, brother, and boss are also fantastic characters that really make this film stand out. It’s very quirky, with some funny yet eccentric moments thrown in for good measure."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Exit","p":["Exit, a Swedish film directed by Peter Lindmark, is probably one of the most thrilling and exciting films I’ve seen at MIFF so far. Thomas is a successful venture capitalist, with a beautiful wife and daughter, and a high-flying business that is making a tonne of cash. Everything is travelling along perfectly until on the eve of closing a lucrative financial deal, his business partner, close friend and mentor, Wihelm is killed and Thomas is framed for his murder. A mix between the Bourne series and The Fugitive, this is an simmering, multi-layered thriller, jam-packed with complex plots, unexpected twists and turns, and non-stop action. The cast in this film is fantastic. Mads Mikkelsen, who plays Thomas, carries with him all the signature traits of a hero, and yet, you always have the feeling that he’s not the good guy he may seem. This is probably due to his previous roles in movies such as Casino Royale, but he has the degree of danger in his eye, that always makes you wonder if you’re batting for the right person. The villains in this film are also brilliant, and actually remind me of some of the corporate criminals in the Bond series. Overall, this is a great movie that honestly keeps you at the end of your seat. There are some very hard to watch moments – such as one involving an air-compressed nail gun as a torture device – but it’s not overly gory. Thomas is forced to rely only on his wits to protect himself and his family, and I think that’s what makes this film so great. All the pressure is on his shoulders, so he has to do some amazing things to ensure his family lives to see another day."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Exterminating Angels","p":["Walking into the theatre, I really didn’t know what to expect from this film. Featuring in the “Forbidden Pleasures” section of the festival, I was sure that I was going to get a fair bit of nudity and adult themes. Hell, to be perfectly honest, I was even expecting to see a fair bit of soft-core porn. Well, with that in mind, this film didn’t disappoint. There was a lot of nudity, adult themes, and soft-core porn – although in some cases it was pushing its “soft” classification. This is a bizarre, yet extremely entertaining film about a trusting French director who is trying to make a film exploring all aspects of female pleasure. While he amazingly finds actresses to star in his movie (although many people do refuse), what he gets in return is more than just naughty acts caught on celluloid, rather a very complicated multi-way relationship. If you don’t like watching young, very desirable, girls playing with themselves under the table of a fancy restaurant, this film is not for you. If you’re not attracted by beautifully filmed sapphic lovers in a hotel corridor, this film is not for you either. But this film is honestly not just an excuse for showing off a lot of breasts and lesbian love scenes. It’s a dark and intense tale examining how we can become completely blinded by our passions instead of using our head and the advice received from our trusted friends. In the case of this film, the director chooses to ignore the wise words from his loving wife and dead grandmother, and the consequences are ghastly. Right throughout the film there is a lot of strange voiceovers, with dialogue such as “their blue desert is only a circle ringed by hell”. There is also several characters that hide in the shadows; athletic female angels, who describe themselves as “not angels anymore, but not witches yet either”, looking over the events that unfold. To be honest, I’m not exactly sure what to make of this film. It’s seriously weird. But it’s very interesting to watch. The director is basically moulding and manipulating these girls, to make his movie come to life, despite claiming that he only has the very best intentions. It’s going to be one of those films that you’re either going to love or hate – I don’t think there is any middle ground. Personally, I found this film really unique, and I’ll admit, having a lot of beautiful women making love to each other didn’t hurt, but there was more to this film than just that."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Falkenberg Farewell","p":["This film is a snapshot into a lives of several young people holed up in a small town called Falkenberg. It’s not a traditional narrative – but more a mood piece, trying to capture what it’s like growing up in that seemingly boring environment, and how these people deal with crossing over from adolescence to adulthood. This is a very slow and almost observatory film, with lots of shots of scenery, and people just hanging about. It tries to evoke emotion, not through dialogue, but more beautiful images of mundane things. It does have one tragic scene, which adds some more energy to the film, but for the most part, this is just a very measured and leisurely film about growing up."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Fast Lane","p":["Fast Lane is a suburb Australian short film about a boy who returns home from a party one night clammy and pale. His mum knows that something is wrong, but Ash doesn’t want to reveal that he may have killed someone by throwing a rock onto a busy freeway. This is an excellent moving story about the relationship between two young teenage boys, and how they deal with growing up and what happens when they egg each other on to do stupid things. The acting is terrific, both by the two boys and by Ash’s mother. This is a really moving short film with a satisfying ending."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"forbidden-lie","l":"Forbidden Lie$","p":["This is probably on of the greatest documentaries I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching. What’s even better is that it’s Australian! It’s the story of Norma Khouri, the author of a best-selling book, Forbidden Love. After the book sold millions right around the globe, and Norma achieved fame and fortune, people started to do a bit of research, and came to the conclusion that the book was fiction – not fact as originally thought. As the filmmaker digs deeper, Norma isn’t the Jordanian virgin on the run from Islamic extremists, she makes out to be. She under investigation from the FBI, has a husband with supposed connections to the mafia, three children, and a whole lot of lies relating to her book. This film is really exciting. It starts off all “Norma is a hero”. It builds her up as some kind of angel. But then, all of a sudden, it shows another side of the story. Her opposition are given room to argue. It’s soon shown that not much in her book is truthful. In fact, a lot of the so-called facts are blatant lies. The filmmaker then goes on a journey to try and uncover the truth. They travel to Jordon with Norma, in an attempt to clear her name, but just end up digging up more dirt. This is a really entertaining documentary, with tremendous production values. Visually, the film is pristine, with great interview backdrops, and vivid locations. The audio design is fantastic, with appropriate music, crystal clear interviews, and some killer and appropriate sound effects. The graphics are very nice – I really love the “smoking title card”; the text looks fantastic. I also feel the filmmakers made a very honest film. They showed all sides and angles of the story, and basically let the audience decide what’s what. I can’t fault this film – it’s absolutely perfect!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Forever Never Anywhere","p":["This film has a very strange beginning in retrospect. It opens with a comedy performer getting lost in the backstage maze of corridors, as he tries to find the stage door. I have absolutely no idea what relevance this has to anything. The comedian eventually finds the stage, and performs his work to a very unsatisfied crowd. After his show he tries to chat up a young women at the bar – but is quickly rejected. On his drive home, he drives past her, and tries again – but still no dice. In frustration he starts masturbating, and runs off the road. His car is stuck in a ditch, so he gets a ride off two men, who are on their way home from a bar opening. As they drive along, the driver doesn’t see the same women running in the middle of the road until the last minute, quickly turns and runs off the road, and down through the forest. The car gets jammed between two trees. No one is hurt – but they’re stuck. The windows are bullet proof, so they can’t smash them. This is a hilarious film about three men, stuck in a car. After several days with no help in sight, a young boy discovers them – but instead of helping, he treats them as a science experiment. Despite the fact that it’s a fairly unbelievable concept, it’s surprisingly realistic, and incredibly funny. Trapped together, they are forced to share unwanted intimacies, and do some pretty disgusting things just to survive. I really enjoyed this movie. It was fairly simple (most of it was filmed in a stationary car), but incredibly effective. The only complaint I have, is that the ending was slightly sudden – with no real resolution. However, it didn’t really matter. This was a really simple idea, shot incredibly well with a great cast, and fantastic script fully of genuinely funny moments."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"how-is-your-fish-today","l":"How Is Your Fish Today?","p":["This is a very strange and unconventional film about a screenwriter who is trying to write a screenplay about a young man who is on the run after he murdered his lover. The film constantly switches between fantasy and reality, as we move from the screenwriters world into the world of his character. The journey the screenwriter designs for his character, inspires him to take the same voyage himself. The film is narrated right throughout the whole movie by the screenwriter, which helps seamlessly blend the two worlds together. This is a very odd movie. At times it’s very hard to work out what it’s all about. However, due to the complex nature of the film, it’s quite an interesting watch. Some of the locations are very beautiful – featuring vast snowy mountains. This film almost feels like a strange dream. It just floats around, with no strict story or structure. It feels as if the director is making it up as he goes along. Although some sections of the film were a tad uninteresting – most of the film was enjoyable and entertaining. It had a lot of film and television references and jokes in it, which is always interesting. Overall, a very strange film – but worth watching!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"I served the King of England","p":["This is a seriously funny and very peculiar film about an old man reminiscing about how, from a very young age, all he wanted in life was to become a millionaire. Over four decades, we watch him transform from a cunning hot dog vendor, to a man of great fortune and eventually a hermit, in constant pursuit of money and women. Full of fantastic slapstick comedy, with some dark political and social satire, this is an enthralling and action-packed film about a vertically challenged man’s life. From a technical point of view, the lighting and photography in this film is fantastic – it has a very fairy tale, yet at the same time realistic look about it. The camera work is also very noteworthy – with some great shots of tables spinning to portray time passing. The story is completely engrossing and enchanting, with some fantastic and extremely unique characters. The way it blends history and fiction is also very cleaver. A very funny film that is very colourful, with some of the most amazing set designs I’ve seen.

Everything looks as if it’s going to plan until one of the girl’s falls quickly and deeply in love with a new man to the town. This newly formed relationship essentially destroys the tight bond between the girls. The acting and casting for this short film is perfect – both lead ladies are such lovable and real characters. The supporting cast is also spot on, and adds such a great degree of realism to the film. The locations are beautiful. The cinematography is superb, although I think there may have been something wrong with the projection as the whole film appeared to be slightly soft in focus. It looks like it was shot and projected on film, despite the fact that the images looked as if they had very little resolution. Regardless, the film was so good that any technical glitches didn’t matter in the slightest. The musical score was suburb and really added to the mood of the film. This is a film essentially about friendship, about how a friendship can suddenly end, and about growing up. This is one of my favourable short films, simply because it’s so beautiful to watch thanks to a fantastic location and a fantastic cast."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Maborosi","p":["Directed by Tokyo born Hirokazu Kore-eda, Maborosi is an extremely slow, yet visually pleasing film about a young women’s struggle to get on with life after her husband commits suicide by jumping in front of a train – leaving their child fatherless. After her husband’s death, she is “set up” with another man who lives on the coast with a child of his own. Made in 1995, this film has a classically Japanese style to it. The cinematography is very lush – however I found the film just too slow to seriously concentrate. Nothing really seemed to happen during the whole 110 minutes! There were a lot of scenery shots, and one scene where the new husband is eating fish at the kitchen table for about 10 minutes! Why this scene was included, and why it went for so long remains a mystery to me! The music throughout the film was very beautiful and lovely to listen to, however there wasn’t enough of it to keep me awake. I’m also not completely sure whether I fell asleep in sections and missed bits of the plot, or whether some sections of the stories just didn’t connect together – but I found this film very hard to follow. The characters in the film where very powerful, and the way the director used light and space to convey emotions was very interesting, however, I just honestly thought this film had no real point to it – and if it did, it could have been compressed into a 5 minute short film. Obviously I wasn’t its biggest fan."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"manufacturing-dissent-michael-moore-and-the-media","l":"Manufacturing Dissent: Michael Moore and the Media","p":["Documentary filmmakers Debbie Melnyck and Rick Caine set out to make a relatively simple and straightforward documentary about their hero Michael Moore, but as they start filming and putting together the film, they soon discover that the Mr Moore isn’t all he’s cracked up to be. Just like Moore’s own film, Roger & Me, this film sees the filmmakers chasing an ever elusive interview with the man himself, facing obstacles and bulky body guards, as well as uncovering hidden and damning truths from opponents, collaborators and even friends. It’s really great to see someone has taken all of Moore’s tricks and methods, and then applied them to Moore himself. It’s also great to see that someone is challenging Moore and the way he makes films in a very intelligent and appropriate manner. This is a really clever concept, which is executed perfectly. It has some really great interviews with people that love and hate Moore, and challenges everything Moore has to say, and has said in the past. Although I wouldn’t say this film is unbiased – I’m sure the filmmakers got pretty pissed off with Mr Moore when he wouldn’t give them a proper sit down interview – it seems to simply give you the facts, and let you as the audience decide whether Moore is a goodie or a baddie.

Whilst he is busy doing his thing, everyone else in Soweto are struggling during tough times, as rent costs are getting higher and the police lock and more and more innocent people. Inevitably, Panic is caught up in the growing anti-apartheid struggle, having to choose between individual gain, and a united stand against the system. This film gives you an inside look into what it was like during this period in Soweto, and also gives you a glimpse of what it was like to be a struggling Black South African in a world controlled by uncaring Whites. What amazes me with this film, is how accurately it captures what Soweto is like (sadly in both past and present), and also the relationship between the lower class Blacks and the upper class Whites. This film gives you a great insight into the township life, and is a great little history lesson into the Apartheid fight. Despite its age, this film is extremely powerful and is sadly still relevant today. One of my favourite films of the festival thus far."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Men at Work","p":["Nothing really beats a film about some good old fashion rock rolling. As four men drive home after a failed skiing trip, they make a quick toilet stop along the way. This is where they discover the rock – a lanky bolder sitting on the edge of a cliff just waiting to be pushed over and sent down the hundreds of kilometres of mountain into a lake. But this particular rock just doesn’t want to budge. Apparently people have been trying to move it for years. But male pride prevents the team from giving up. This is a film about male bonding, and male ego, as the four are put to a series of physical and psychological tests as they try and send the rock flying. More and more cars pull up full of additional male arrogance, shovels and chain saws are obtained, even a donkey steps up to the challenge – but the bastard just won’t budge. I really enjoyed this film. Starting off as a human interest drama, as soon as the rock appears, classic comedy moments surface. This is a movie that I can really relate to. Right throughout the film I was honestly thinking – now, how would I move this rock? I’m not quite sure what it is about a rock sitting on the top of a hill, but for some reason it seems like human instinct to want to push it down. The only negative thing I have to say about this film was the subtitles. They were incredibly hard to read. But apart from that, this was a great film! Very simple – the look of the film was very rough, and gritty, as was the soundtrack, but it was a film about men trying to get a rock to roll so it was very appropriate. A masterpiece of Iran cinema!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"MIFF 2007 Animation Shorts Programme","p":["This year’s animation shorts programme offered a great deal of variety. Norbot, an Australian short animation, told the story of a child that was born with huge ears, and his fight to find his place in the world. This was a very funny film, with some very cute animations. Horn OK Please, a UK animation, offered a day in the life of a Mumbai taxi driver, as he struggled to raise enough money to upgrade his ageing car to a shiny new model. It had fantastic animation, and some very funny moments. Adjustment was what I would regard as an experimental short film that used a whole heap of different stop motion animation techniques to fell the story of an obsessive visual diarist, who documents the disintegration of his relationship. It mixed normal video footage with stop frame animation, as well as photo realistic 3D graphics, and traditional flip book animation to great effect. I felt like this short film was more about the techniques than the story, but never-the-less, I was very impressed. I really loved the flip book style animation using a toilet paper roll, and also the section where they mixed current video footage, with flip book animation from the past. The Lady on the Threshold, was a bizarre animation, about a sea captain who arrives home and is intrigued by a mysterious beautiful women. He soon finds out the woman is married to another sea caption, who has be involved in an accident in the past that has resulted in a loss of his legs and hands. As the story continues, we learn what really happened to the sea captain. This was a very dark piece, with a very satisfying, although slightly sick conclusion. The Bronze Mirror is a very funny short film about some villagers in ancient Korea, who stumble across a mirror – a piece of technology that is not yet known to the masses. They get quite a shock when they see a familiar face in the piece of glass in front of them! Fetch, is a great, yet really short, film about a man trying to get his dog to fetch a stick. Slightly sick, but very funny! Lapsus, was also another funny, yet very simple animation about a nervous nun, a white space and a black void. Driven purely by visual humour, the nun is forced to explore the dark and the light side of the screen. Despite its simplicity, this is very cleaver concept that is executed perfectly! The only other film work mentioning (although there were several other films shown), was Ark. This was a very dark film, about an unknown virus that has destroyed almost the entire human population. Unsure of why all this is happening, the remaining survivors escape via the sea to a far away island. Although the ending is a bit of a letdown in some ways, the 3D animation is some of the best I’ve ever seen. It has a very dark, and almost Matrix feel to it, but it’s extremely realistic."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"MIFF 2007 Australian Short Stories","p":["Australian Short Stories is a collection of Australian Indigenous films of all different shapes and sizes. It opened with Hush – a fantastic and very funny little film about a mother who works as a phone sex person during the night, and is eventually found out by her outraged daughter. Backseat, is a moving film about a young girl who is reunited with her real family, courtesy of her foster parents. Custard, is a cute and peculiar film about a teenage Aboriginal girl, and her grandmother as they deal with the death of her grandfather. Nana, was my favourite film of the screening. It’s a very simple little film, narrated by a young girl as she explains what she loves about her Nana. What makes this film so funny is that the Nana does a lot of crazy things, which you just don’t imagine Nana’s should or could do! The young girl telling the story is so innocent, and full of love for her Nana, and yet the old Nana is so not innocent and full of hate for the drunks that come to her town! When the Natives Get Restless is a 28 minute documentary that explores the lives of an aboriginal community living in a housing estate in Dubbo. This is a very moving documentary that captures some amazing interviews from kids who are causing trouble simply because they’ve got nothing else to do. It also gives you a revealing insight into what the people are going through as they are effectively kick out of their homes and are forced to relocate. The filmmakers obviously spend a great deal of time in Dubbo, as they have obtained a great deal of trust from the people they speak to. There was also a collection of ABC funded animations, which tell different Aboriginal dreamtime stories – although to be perfectly honest, despite the fact that they were of the highest production values, and utilised some fantastic and varied animation techniques I wasn’t the biggest fan. Everything was a bit too “arty” for me, and I found it hard to really connect with the story. Finally, Crocodile Dreaming is a fantastic short film about another dreamtime story, of a man who loses a stone containing all of the tribe’s ancestor’s stories, and as a result angers the crocodile spirits. When a crocodile kills his daughter in a normally safe lagoon, the community is forced to send someone to try and find the rock and return it to the rightful place. This film had some absolutely amazing visual effects that were incredibly realistic. It successfully merged reality with fantasy to great effect. The soundtrack was also amazing – with some great creepy sound effects."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"MIFF 2007 Documentary Shorts Programme 2","p":["I Want to Be a Pilot, is a depressing and eye-opening film about a 12-year-old boy who lives in the slums of East Africa, and only has one dream in life – to become a pilot, so that he can escape the world he’s grown up in, and fly away to see his parents. The narration right throughout the film, by the boy, is incredibly effective. The visuals, showing the wasteland that he lives in is dirty and grotty film that really fits in with the whole theme of the film. It’s a sad film, for obvious reasons, but is very powerful, and is a great film for highlighting the poverty problems in Africa.","Human Performance and Limitations, is an odd film that has lots of observational footage of an aircraft, with a voice over from a supposedly very skilled and experienced neurologist who believed his pilot on a recent flight was either on drugs or mentally unstable. However, it reveals that this was not the case – the pilot was drug free and mentally healthy. Although it was interesting the watch, the conclusion pretty much destroyed the film. I think I missed the point of it. It apparently is supposed to reflect the anxiety surrounding plane travel after September the 11th, but it doesn’t make any reference to what year it was supposed to be, so that’s pretty useless.","Passage, a Brazilian film, is the story of a person walking along a highway that never ends, with no destination in mind. It’s basically just a whole lot of footage of a man walking, with his voice over talking about what it was like to film the film. I didn’t really find a point to it, and found it incredibly boring.","The Butcher’s Wife, is a fantastic and powerful VCA documentary, about a female filmmakers who confronts her mother, to reveal an open and extremely intimate account of personal meaning, and the awful impact of domestic abuse. This was an incredibly brave thing to do, for both the mother, and her filmmaker child. All of their darkest family secrets are now captured on tape forever. The production values weren’t great – it was shot on a consumer video camera, and the audio was pretty rough in places, but what was captured was raw, real and very moving.","Lipari, is a day in the life of a crew aboard a fishing boat. It has no dialogue, and is basically just observational footage of their day. The film is slow and observational, but not boring. The footage is all fantastic, and really captures what it is like to be on their boat. The sound design is simple, basically just a whole lot of atmosphere noises, however it really works.","The Fighting Cholitas, is a great Bolivian film about a group of bold and resilient female Bolivian wrestlers. Each week, these women jump into the ring in their traditional and vibrant multi-layered skirts and beat the crap out of each other, all for the good of the audience. It’s really bizarre seeing these seemingly un-athletic people, perform amazing wrestling moves in totally unsuited attire. You get a great insight into why these women do what they do, and what they do when they’re not fighting. An extraordinary and extremely fascinating film!","Finally, Untold is a six part short film that uses a lot of archive footage to tell, well, I’m not exactly sure. This was probably one of the most uninteresting films I’ve ever seen. The footage was quite interesting, and the way it was edited together was fine – however, the story it produced was too boring to even think about. I couldn’t concentrate for a second, as the narration was just so monotonous. I have no idea what the point of the film was – all I know is that as soon as it started, I really wanted it to end!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"miff-2007-experimental--conceptual-shorts-programme","l":"MIFF 2007 Experimental & Conceptual Shorts Programme","p":["When you walk into this programme, you know you’re going to witness some pretty abstract and crazy things. This was no exception. From strobing dots to 20 minutes of naked stop frame animation, to random lost film footage, to sped up and reversed footage of wheels rolling down hills – this collection had it all. I won’t describe each film individually, because everything all kind of melted into one horrible nightmare. There was some great stuff in there. I really loved the concept of having multiple layers of paper, and as each layer is ripped off, a different image is revealed. I also loved some of the stop frame animation techniques. However, most of the films had sequences which were incredibly repetitive, and a sound track that made you go a little bit loopy. Everything was very random and obviously had no real purpose or story. There was a lot of storing, but that was bearable compared to the horrible loud sounds coming from some of the films. Most of the films went for too long. You could easily hear the audience getting more and more frustrated and impatient as some of the films just didn’t know when to stop. Seventeen minutes of repeating footage of scary clowns, and other swaying items is really enough to make you sick. It’s worth watching this programme, if only to take away a couple of technical ideas and concepts – but I never (and I really mean never!), want to see any of these films again."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"miff-2007-short--local","l":"MIFF 2007 Short & Local","p":["I was really impressed with the Short & Local films this year. It opened with Sian Davies film, Poetry, a beautiful, yet shadowy film about two teenage girls struggling with the complexities of the schoolyard, relationships and growing up. The acting in this film was spot on – you really felt for and believed these characters. The portrayal of the school was also extremely realistic. Unlike a lot of films, this really felt, looked and sounded like a high school environment. The bullying scattered right throughout the film is exactly the kind of stuff that happens in schools right throughout Australia every day – it’s captured with extreme accuracy. Nothing was sugar coated, everything was spot on. The cinematography, colour grading and set design of the film was very appropriate and helped compliment the dark mood of the film. I really loved the colour scheme of the film – nothing was bright and friendly, but instead dark and contrasty. The sound design was also subtle, yet extremely effective. It’s hard to re-create what a school yard sounds like, and yet this film pulled it off. Technically, I felt this film was a great achievement. However, the story for me seemed to lack any real depth. I didn’t really understand what the two girls were going through – but maybe that’s simply because I’m a boy, I’m not sure.","Kindle was another very fascinating film. It told the story of a troubled young man and an equally distressed young lady who reside in a community share house. Both of them obviously have had very complicated and distressing lives, and neither of them are quite sure of who they are. However, they both have one thing in common at least – their amazement for one of the world’s natural wonders…fire. I really enjoyed this short film. It was simple – yet incredibly effective.","Dance Like Your Old Man, was a incredibly cleaver concept, which had women of all ages, dancing like their fathers, whilst a voice over interview took place as they talked about their relationship with their father. It was a very cleaver combination of visual humour (it was great to see all these women doing all these very daggy Dad dancing moves) and very heart felt interviews. Visually, the film was very simple – people dancing in front of a white backdrop. The sound component was also uncomplicated; just people talking about their Dads. However, mix the two and you’ve got a very fascinating short film!","The Postman, was what I would call a typical film school type short film. It had very high production values, and a good script. But it had that film school feel to it. It was a simple story about a lonely elderly postman, who finds a friend in his young next-door neighbour over games of chess. It has a very cute and appropriate ending. Visually, the film looks great. The sound design is also very subtle, yet powerful, as this is not a film driven by dialogue.","I’m not sure what the film Dugong had to do with Dugong’s, but never-the-less it was a great film. All though, maybe I missed the point! Maybe it was about Dugong’s after all, and I just didn’t get it. Either way, I enjoyed it. It was about an older brother dropping in on his younger brother’s wedding after disappearing away from the family for several years prior. It had some great little visual jokes in it, as well as a really cool dog. Mixed with some great underwater photography of Dugongs – and you can’t go wrong!","Punch, was a short film set in France, with English subtitles that followed around a clown as he walked around the city reminiscing of the good old days when everyone loved him. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t get what this film was really about. The look of the film was very nice – I loved the contrast between the locations and the red hair and boots of the clown.","In Absentia was an experimental film that made absolutely no sense to me, and by the sounds of it, nor anyone else in the screening. As most experimental films are – this was just a whole lot of footage thrown together. They would have spent a fair bit of money on the sound design; however it didn’t help make the film any better. I have no idea what this film was about – if anything – nor do I have any idea why the director made it.","Finally, Remember My Name was the highlight of the section. It was a documentary building up to a big public performance on Bourke Street mall. The film starts with a whole lot of interviews. All the people explain they are involved in something “big” and potentially controversial, however no one reveals the secret. This film had a whole lot of very funny and unrevealing interviews, until it leads up to the main event – the huge and very funny public performance. I really loved the structure of this film. It was really exciting to watch. The build up was very stirring, and the climax hilarious!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"miff-2007-world-fiction-shorts---programme-2","l":"MIFF 2007 World Fiction Shorts - Programme 2","p":["Once again, the short film sessions at MIFF this year have all been extremely impressive. Caught, is a short and simple one gag film about a man who sleeps over at a woman’s house, and is unfortunately greeted by a not-so-impressed boyfriend as he tries to leave. The film is beautifully acted and directed, and has a killer punch line. This is a really great little rollercoaster ride, despite only lasting three minutes. It has an absolutely fantastic ending.","Jamaica, is the story of two lovers stuck in the middle of an unknown war zone, in an undefined era, who are trying to escape the realities of the outside world. In this truly beautiful Spanish film, the two lovers perform their own wedding ceremony, and relish their final moments together as the looming and anonymous threat of interruption and danger draws nearer. The cinematography in this film is fantastic. They use the lack of depth of field to great effect. The acting is superb, and despite only being a fifth teen minute film, you really feel attached to the two characters. There is a great deal of mystery and suspense in this film, as the enemy is faceless and unknown. In fact, the audience know very little about either of these peoples past or what lies ahead in the future. This is a great film that will make you laugh, make you cry, and gets your brain running as to why the situation is as it is.","Fair Trade, a German film, is a story about child trade between two very close countries in Europe. A desperate lady makes a trip overseas to meet up with her future child. After meeting with the baby, and witnessing the very distressed and extremely young mother, she decides to go along with the purchase. She agrees to meet the seller at a specific location back in her country the next day. Unfortunately though, as the smuggler tries to transport the baby via the sea, things don’t go exactly to plan. This is a tragic and moving story, about something that happens quite regularly. It’s very hard to watch, as a baby is affectively getting stolen from its mother, despite assurances that it will get a better life, and also because not everything goes to plan in this film. The locations are picturesque, and the photography is striking. It’s a great film, which really makes you think about the child smuggling business.","True Colours, is a British film about a loving family man with an implied susceptibility to violence, trip to the supermarket with his wife and child which goes horribly and tragically wrong. This is a really sad film to watch. At the beginning of the film, the husband tries hard to win his wife’s trust as he reveals a swollen and cut up lip, presumably due to fighting. But as he goes into the shop to pick up some ice cream for his adorable little boy, all that trust is quickly lost due to unfortunate bad luck and judgement. The casting and acting in this film is on the mark; the husband is very true to life, and the child is very cute. Essentially this is a very compelling film about fate, and also about perceptions.","Wrestling, is a very odd, yet extremely interesting and entertaining Iceland film about two men wrestling with the challenges of their constrictive world. The two men, one a farmer, the other a tunnel worker are having a relationship together, despite one of them already being married with a young child. When the drill finally breaks through the rock, signalling the end of the tunnel, this is also the end of the friendship between the two men. But, before one of them leaves, he decides to settle the matter over an unconventional wrestling match. This is a very visual film that uses images to explain the story, as opposed to lots of dialogue. The cruel and hostile landscape is the perfect backdrop, for a relationship that is laced with problems from the get go. The tunnel drilling and the wrestling is all a visual metaphor for what these people are going through. The wrestling, though is the standout component of the film, as it’s just so funny to watch – but again, it’s a ironic that a sport based on fighting, could actually bring two people closer together.","Fog, is another visually appealing film about a teenage boy called Ricky, who lives in a small fishing community in New Zealand, and is hindered by the expectations of his overbearing father. He is heavily attracted to an eccentric and outrageous girl who lives in the town, and decides to take her out on his father’s boat, late at night, under the protection of a blanket of thick fog. This is a really fascinating short film that really explores the relationship between the two young potential lovers. A lot of money has obviously gone into the production of this film, as it looks and sounds fantastic; especially the heavy fog scenes, set out at sea. The story is very entertaining, with a very appropriate, and satisfying conclusion.","Coco-Nuts, is a crazy Norway film, that mixes and matches documentary and fiction. As two girlfriends meet up at a coconut cake factory and store, they break in and out of song as they talk about their boyfriends, and potential lovers. Meanwhile, behind the counter, the owner of the shop is struggling to tell the documentary team about his apparently successful business. This is a seriously odd and playful film, which no real point to it, apart from pure entertainment. It does make you laugh – although you seriously have to wonder what it was really all about!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Radiant City","p":["I’m not quite sure if you can call it a documentary, as it seriously pushes the boundaries of the genre, so I’ll just call it a film about suburbs. In documentary style, it examines the attraction and the bleak realities of suburban living. Focussing mainly on a typical suburban family going through their daily life, this film also has many interviews with developers and cultural theorists, all discussing the one thing – suburbs. This film is also all an illusion. It drags you in, claiming to be a doco, only to reveal that the characters you have grown to love and trust and simply actors. But the beautiful thing is, even after you are told that everyone was following a script, you quickly discover that the actors are just as down to earth and lovely as the characters they portrayed. This is subtly funny and incredibly well scripted film. In retrospect, everything was a little bit too perfect at the beginning. All the characters were just too perfect. The kids also didn’t look anything like their parents – and were more a Hollywood family than real life. It’s a film that really makes you think about urban growth and sprawl, but also about the nature of documentary film making. I really enjoyed this film – despite being tricked by the directors. It’s a very cleaver concept, which reveals what it’s really like to like in the suburbs, even though we were only watching actors."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Red Road","p":["Red Road is a dark thriller about Jackie, a surveillance camera officer, who watches over the dangerous streets of Glasgow on a matrix of television screens. One day, she recognises a man whose past collides traumatically with her own. She begins to stalk him. After following him under the security of closed circuit surveillance cameras, she takes the next step, and integrates herself into his life. As she becomes closer to him, and the stakes becomes much higher, we start to learn the facts behind why she is so intent of hunting down this man. This film starts off really slow. We observe Jackie watching camera footage of uneventful streets and shop fronts. But, as she becomes more obsessed with keeping tabs on the mystery man, the film gains momentum, and doesn’t stop until the very end. Jackie is thrown into a dangerous world, full of dodgy people. But we don’t understand why she puts herself in this situation until the very end, and by then, everything is quite intense. Although I wouldn’t say this is one of my favourite films, it certainly isn’t boring by the end. In fact, it becomes quite disturbing and almost terrifying in sections. Incredibly well acted – this film really takes you on a journey through some quite scary territory. The look of the film is very rough and gritty, to match the tough neighbourhood. The sound design is very minimal, with no music throughout the whole film. A bit slow in places, but waiting till the end is worth it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Rescue Dawn","p":["At the time, I really enjoyed this film. It was exciting, it was interested, and I actually cared for the characters. I thought the opening special effects were a bit suss, but apart from that, I thought it was a good fun, and dramatic movie. But, in retrospect, I have a lot of issues with this film. That said, I still like the film – it kept me entertained for 126 minutes, but it does have its floors. This film is based on a true story of a US air pilot who was shot down while flying over Laos, during a classified mission during the Vietnam War. After the plane comes crashing to the ground, within no time at all, he’s captured and put into a prisoners camp – no surprise there! Not accepting the certain death ahead, he decides to craft a plan to escape with the several other American prisoners of War. This film was full of clichés. It started off very predictably, with US soldiers, being very cocky and arrogant, as they fool around before their mission. But the main problem I had was that the film was pretty unrealistic. Who shot down the plane? The whole opening happened so fast, that you didn’t have a chance to work out why it happened. The main character looked and acted as if he was enjoying his time at the prison. He was also very healthy looking, considering none of the prisoners ate anything of real substance. Why did the locals randomly kill the American solider with machetes? Why not kill them both? Why did the American’s throw away their guns? Why didn’t they capture the local who caught the fish, seeing as they had weapons, they were starving, and the man had nothing to protect him? Why was the ending so “this man’s a hero”? It was a bit over-the-top! I know this is supposed to be based on a true story – but there are just so many things I can’t see as really happening. Although a lot of people seem to disagree with me, I also feel this is a very “pro America” film. The American’s were “so good” and the people of the Vietnamese jungle “so bad”. I’m sure they weren’t the nicest people on earth – they did torture him after all, but the way the script was structured kind of disturbed me. I didn’t feel as if the enemy were real people, but instead, just the enemy. As I said, at the time, I really enjoyed watching it. Even after, I felt satisfied. I rate this film highly. It’s just that there were a lot of things that didn’t sit right. The actor behind Dengler was the main issue. He always seemed more “drunk” than someone who’s just been tortured and locked up. Finally, there was no perspective of time. The characters seemed to know what day it was, but the audience had no idea. Either way, I still liked it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Shahram and Abbas","p":["This witty yet tragic longish short film is about two Iranian refugees – a journalist in his 40s and an adventurous yet lonely man in his late 20s – who pretend to be a gay couple in order to obtain asylum. What starts off as a relatively straight forward plan becomes slightly more complicated when the younger man falls in love with an African lady with a child in the refugee camp. Things are further complicated when their documents claim they were whipped by the authorities prior to their leaving of the country due to their sexuality. This is a really entertaining short film. The acting by the “odd couple” is great; there is a real chemistry between the two men. The cinematography is excellent – I especially loved the look of the snow scene. There are some really funny moments in this film, although all of them are quite subtle. It also has a very cleaver and satisfying ending."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Snow Angels","p":["Snow Angels is a naturalistic Canadian film that explores several different relationships that all interconnect in one way or another. Arthur is a trombonist for the high school, who is exploring his first real relationship with a new girl to the school, a photographer named Lila, while his parents are battling their way through a patchy separation. Meanwhile, Arthur’s co-worker and childhood baby sitter Annie is fighting off her alcoholic and potentially suicidal ex-husband who persists in re-entering her life, and that of their daughter. To add to the complications, Annie is sleeping with her best friend’s husband – her best friend also working with her and Arthur. This is an ultimately sad and depressing film about human suffering, personal connections, and the complexities of love and relationships. The film has an almost “Garden State” feel too it, without the comedy. Although there are some funny moments – most of which come from Arthur – this is essentially a sad story with a large amount of death involved. You become instantly attached to all of the characters, despite their obvious flaws. The acting is fantastic – you almost feel as if you’re watching real events, rather than a fictional story. This is a film about people, so you don’t really pay that much attention to the visuals, although everything is very beautiful – set in lush snowy locations. I really liked this film – although it’s hard to say that I enjoyed it. It was tremendously sad and gloomy, although there were signs of life and happiness. The music was very appropriate and added to the beauty of the film, but the characters are what made this film so special for me."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Soft Words","p":["Soft Words is a very political film about how John Howard and the government misuse the English language for political gain.

It has several key moments where things just don’t happen as planed – leaving the audience in complete and utter shock. The events are so unpredictable and heart breaking, that they’re funny. The film looks great – despite the fact that most of it takes place in a single location – a car. The characters and acting are superb, especially the extras (specifically the two Indian men who work in the petrol station). This film has some fantastic visual effects, which look completely realistic. Overall, this is just a really entertaining film. A great concept that was filmed perfectly!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Bet Collector","p":["The Bet Collector, a Philippines film, follows the life of Amy, an uncanny saleswoman who runs around town convincing people to part with their hard earned cast by placing bets on the illegal game of Jueteng, or by collecting money for the families of recently deceased locals to cover the funeral costs. This film had a really great central topic to base its story around – Jueteng. Despite the fact that it’s banned, everyone it seems is addicted to it, even the police who are responsible for ensuring it doesn’t take place. However, although the game is referenced to right throughout the film, it doesn’t play as bigger role as I would have hoped. Instead, the film is basically about Amy’s troubles – endless cycles of poverty, corruption, and trying to avoid the cops. It has some funny moments – Amy is constantly working out potentially winning numbers based on situations that happen around her (for instance, when a boy gets scared by a frog he thinks is a snake, she puts a bet on 12 and 9 for frog and coward). There is also some humorous chase and hiding sequences, as the Jueteng players and bookies think that the police are near. By overall, this was a pretty disappointing film. There seemed to be not point to the film – or at least, if there was one, I didn’t pick up. The film made reference to Amy’s dead son quite a bit, but I’m not exactly sure why. The film had a very documentary feel to it – especially at the beginning, and as a result, everything looked very real and natural. It had some dramatic moments – for example, there was a shooting sequence – but it didn’t really seem to help propel the story. It felt like more of an observational film about a whole lot of people addicted to a game they called Jueteng."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Boss of it All","p":["This is a very funny and essentially harmless film about the owner of an IT company that decides to sell up and move on, forcing to wheel out the CEO to sign on the dotted line, sealing the deal. Trouble is the supposed America-based CEO doesn’t really exist. He’s basically just an e-mail address that is created to take the blame for unpopular decisions. The solution that the owner comes up with, who claims to be just another white collar worker in the film, is to hire an actor to play the part in his devious charade. But, as the actor begins to slowly fit into his character, he becomes attached to his associates, and tries to convince the owner not to sell up. This is a very strange, yet incredibly entertaining film. Using a lot of very random camera angles and shots, as well as opening and closing with narration which talks about the fact that the film is a comedy – this is not your conventional film. The characters are all completely over-the-top, and definitely completely-and-utterly crazy – but are all very likable in a strange office co-worker kind of way. This is a very unique film, with a very unusual style. I really enjoyed it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Hottest State","p":["This is without a doubt, my favourite film of the festival so far. It tells the story of William, an aspiring actor, who meets and falls quickly and madly in love with Sara, a seductive singer/songwriter, just a few days before his 21st birthday. William convinces Sara to come away with him to Mexico, while he works on a feature film. During their time away, William becomes completely and utterly devoted and obsessed with Sara. They are both caught up in the giddy flutter of young love. However, Sara goes home early, and by the time William gets back to the women of his dreams, she has decided that the relationship is over. William is devastated. His perfect world comes quickly crashing to a halt. Having never experienced the pain of love and heartbreak, he takes things a little hard (well, really hard), and ends up fleeing home to Texas in search for answers. Yearning for someone to love him the way he loved Sara, William’s journey to his birthplace forces him to come to terms with his own past. This is a coming of age tale of first love and heartbreak, but it’s also the story of a wounded young boy searching for a father he never knew. I guess what made this film so special for me, was that it felt so real. As someone that’s in the same age bracket as the characters in this film, I can honestly relate to them and recognised a lot of the emotional patterns they went through. Everything in this film felt so authentic and close to home. William’s tragic descent into desperation and despair, and his increasingly chaotic and manic behaviour, although slightly scary, felt perfectly understandable, and although the scenes were he left messages on Sara’s answering machine were extremely uncomfortable to watch – you could understand why William was leaving them, even though you knew he shouldn’t be. From the beginning of this film, you knew where everything was heading. The reality is that all of this stuff happens on a day to day basis. Young lovers are constantly going through these exact same scenarios. This is what made this film so interesting to me. I could relate to it, and although I didn’t necessarily learn from it – it was nice to know that this kind of situation is normal, and is all part of growing up. The acting in this film was phenomenal. Mark Webber, who played William, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, who played Sara, has an amazing chemistry in this film. When they fall in love – you honestly believe that the actors are in love. When they break up, the tears and frustration are so real, that you completely forget you are watching a fictional film. The soundtrack in this film was also a highlight. It really complimented the emotion of the scenes, in much the same way as in films such as Garden State. Visually, the film looks absolutely beautiful, with a very country USA tone to the images. As I said, this is by far my favourite film of the festival thus far."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Mourning Forest","p":["Directed by Naomi Kawase, The Mourning Forest is a visually and emotionally beautiful film about a young lady called Machiko, who works at a retirement home nearby a vast forest.

Although the relationship starts off badly – Machiko gets struck down by Shigeki after she tries touches one of his possessions, which she shouldn’t have – the two quickly become attached to one another, as they play games in the fields. Despite the fact that there is a huge age difference between the two, they have a common love for childish games such as hide and seek. When Machiko takes Shigeki on a drive in the country as a birthday present, things don’t exactly go to plan when the car gets stuck in a ditch. Shigeki runs off, as the two continue a more serious version of hide and seek in the forest. During their time under the canopy of trees, they learn a lot more about themselves and each other.","There is a strange sexual tension between Machiko and Shigeki, which makes the film so interesting to watch. Both characters are tremendously well acted, as you really feel for them and understand the connection they appear to have. The sound design is amazing, and is a highlight of this film. As there is minimal dialogue in this film, a lot is driven by the vivid visuals of lush landscapes and a subtle musical score and soundscape.","Despite the fact that this is a really slow movie, with not a huge amount of action, the characters keep you interested. I strongly recommend watching it – if only to see the chemistry between the lead actors."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Signal","p":["This is a very low budget independent film – but in the best possible way. Full of blood and guts – this is a film, split into three parts by three different filmmakers, about a mysterious signal that gets sent out around an American city, taking over every electronic device, and wreaking psychological pandemonium. All of a sudden, the signal turns normal people into homicidal maniacs. Amongst all the mayhem is a woman that is cheating on her husband. As people are killing each other left, right and centre, a three way relationship is battling out till the death. I’m not normally a fan of horror films – nor am I a fan of blood in any shape or form. However, this is a really entertaining film. It starts off looking as if it’s going to be absolutely terrifying. I was honestly thinking that I was going to freak out catching the train home alone late at night. However, as the movie progressed, the gore factor rose, but with it, so did the humour. The horrific events that took place, where just so outrageous and surreal, that you couldn’t help but laugh. Maybe it was laughing in fear – but it was laughing never-the-less. This wasn’t your traditional zombie comedy, nor was it an apocalyptic horror film – it was in a league of its own. The special effects were crud – but effective. There were plenty of moments that made you jump – and lots of movements where I was forced to look away in disgust. Overall, this was an entertaining film. I didn’t leave the theatre looking over my shoulder, which was a good thing. The film messed around with time as well, turning back on itself, and also played around with what is real, and what is in the mind. I don’t think I’d watch it again any time soon – but I’m glad I’ve seen it once."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Waimate Conspiracy","p":["This is an extremely entertaining and obviously no-budget mockumentary about a fictional land rights claim in the town of Waimate, New Zealand. The Maori locals have been fighting for decades to regain their land, which they believe they were forcefully removed from in a bloody battle back in 1866. Unfortunately, when they take their views to the courtroom, they have no evidence to back them up, and their court claim is rejected. However, they decided to appeal the decision after they find a supposed 138 year old cannonball buried in a paddock, which they believe confirms their case. Just when they think they’ve finally got everything sorted, the cannonball goes missing, and they are forced to come up with some new evidence. This film is basically a war between the Maori locals and an evil farmer who currently has ownership of the land and isn’t afraid to do anything he can to make sure it stays under his name. All of this action, including interviews with other locals is captured by Dave, a documentary filmmaker, who takes you along this hilarious journey. This film is a mixture between Kenny and The Castle. Every single character is completely eccentric, and tremendously funny. The Maori people will do everything in their power to try and get their land back – even if it means breaking all the rules. The production values of this film are horrible – it’s very much a no-budget documentary, shot on a handycam – but the people and the script are so perfect, that it really doesn’t matter. This film treats a normally controversial topic with a very new and very funny angle. Although there are some moments in the movie which are painful to watch (simply because the characters are so nutty – kind of like The Office), most of the time you simply can’t look away and stop laughing. Overall, this is a pretty good movie considering – although I’m sure with a slightly bigger budget, some more jokes and funny moments could have been thrown in."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Vengeance Is Mine","p":["Shohei Imamura’s 1979 film, Vengeance Is Mine, tells the story of a 78-day crime spree by a serial killer who is constantly evading police in Japan. The film constantly jumps too and fro in time; one moment the killer is locked up, the next we are seeing the crimes he has committed in the past. This is a very powerful and dramatic film, with some very graphic images of people getting murder in cold blood. Its action packed from start to finished, and hasn’t really aged. I really liked this movie – although it’s hard to say that I enjoyed it. There are some really tough moments to watch. The characters in this film are very well acted, and portray some very mysterious and intriguing relationships between each other. Right throughout the movie you, as a viewer, are constantly trying to work out what the main character is thinking, and why he does the horrible things he does – it very rarely gives you a second to relax, and absorb the information. The only think I disliked about the film was the very bizarre ending. Maybe there is some kind of religious message throughout the whole film that I simply didn’t get."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Wolfsbergen","p":["What are the chances? The film I hated the most has been the only film with projection problems, forcing the screening to run for even longer. I think the projectionist fell asleep. I don’t know what it was about this film, but it was incredibly boring. It opened with a five minute wide shot of a forest. Nothing happened. Nothing at all! The rest of the film wasn’t that much better. Stuff happened, but it was so tedious, that I didn’t take any of it in. It shouldn’t have been boring. It had people dieing, wives creating on husbands, husbands sleeping with wives sisters, child dramas, and all that. But it was just really, really uninteresting. Everything was so slow. All the shots ran for a minute longer than they needed to. The acting was probably OK, but there was so much space between words, that you couldn’t take in the dialogue, and therefore didn’t even concentrate on what the actors were doing, let alone saying. The young girl was a good actor – I noticed that. She was very believable, and despite the fact she didn’t say much, her presence on the screen was very powerful. But that was the only positive thing I got out of this film."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"you-the-living","l":"You, the Living","p":["This is one of the more bizarre films I’ve seen at the festival. I’m not exactly sure what it was about. It wasn’t your traditional narrative. It was basically just a whole lot of beautifully crafted, and precisely framed long-takes of awkward, although mostly humorous, encounters involving a series of equally strange characters. The look and style of the film was very plain, minimal, and almost like that of a really low budget uncreative student film. Everything looked as if it was a studio set, and was purposely placed. This film was already incredibly funny – in a very weird sense. It reminded me of the great “cow bell” skit. These filmmakers must have had some serious patience and persistence. All of their jokes were incredibly subtle, and everything ran on for just those few minutes too long – but it uncomfortable to watch, yet at the same time, absolutely perplexing. I really enjoyed this film, and it’s very dry humour. It was seriously unusual – but very funny and unpredictable."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Severance","p":["Another Bloody Office Outing.","The Company Is Making Cutbacks.","If you put The Office (2001) and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) in a blender, the end result would be something quite similar to writer/director Christopher Smith’s second feature film, Severance (2006). Moving onward and upward from his first feature, Creep (2004), Smith has decided to expand upon his horror/thriller repertoire, adding comedy to the mix. However, unlike other British horror/comedy films such as the highly successful Shaun of the Dead (2004)– which is without doubts side-splittingly hilarious, but honestly not bloodcurdling in the slightest (despite a lot of airborne blood) – this film successfully oscillates between the two genres; it makes you laugh and yet still gives you the absolute creeps. The story is simple: a team of sales executives from Palisade Defence, a multi-national weapons company, head to a corporate retreat in the forests of Hungary as a team and morale building exercise. When they come across a road block due to a suspiciously fallen tree, and their foreign speaking bus driver refuses to go an alternate route, they are forced to walk to their secluded lodge. They make it safely (although much to their dismay, their supposed luxurious lodge is more like a haunted mansion), but are soon hunted down one by one by merciless masked assailants in the woods for reasons that are never fully explained – although a lot of hypothetical theories are thrown out there.","The first half of the film exists purely to build up the suspense, primarily through extremely witty humour and clever visual gags. Walking into the theatre, you already know you are going to see a lot of gore, but the blood and guts don’t really start flying until you’re sunk quite comfortably in your seat. Smith skilfully leads the audience in one direction, and then recklessly puts on the handbrake so that you end up heading on a completely different course. One minute you’re laughing – the next you’re covering you’re eyes. When people start dieing, you start doing both.","The characters in this film feel like they’ve just come off the set of The Office. The reactions they have with the horror in front of them are both credible and fun. Danny Dyer’s character is a highlight – a lovable loafer, who spends most of the first part of the movie in a magic mushroom induced frenzy. Although some might call these kinds of “drugs jokes” effortless adolescence humour, judging from the reaction of a wide ranged audience at MIFF, this is clearly not the case.","Once the killing starts, the comedy is put on hold and is only given out again in prescribed doses when you least expect it. The gore factor is extremely high – with some massively disturbing and terrifying scenes. Some of the more sane characters are deliberately destroyed in very moving, and immensely horrific ways. The special and visual effects are both realistic and gruesome. Political undertones, as well as the fact that the film deliberately pays tribute and pushes the boundaries of specific genres, gives the film an extra element of intrigue.","This is a very enjoyable and unpredictable film, with some tremendous high production values. The musical score by John Frankish(who also wrote the score for MIFF 2006’s Opal Dream), as well as a terrific sound design helps keeps the audience going. The photography and images are both beautiful and petrifying – which is a great accomplishment considering this is Ed Wild’s first feature film as cinematographer.","You will be either clutching the person next to you or weeping with laughter as Smith takes you on an increasingly insane roller-coaster ride with everything you want in this kind of film – it even has a bear!"]},{"l":"References","p":["Severance (2006), Internet Movie Database Inc., viewed 15 August 2007, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464196/.","Severance (2006), Melbourne International Film Festival, viewed 15 August 2007, http://www.melbournefilmfestival.com.au/2007/film?film_id=7394"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"its-a-wonderful-life","l":"It’s a Wonderful Life…","p":["This film truly takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. It’ll make you laugh and it will [almost] bring a tear to your eye. But what I really liked about this film was that it was surprisingly unpredictable. I was absolutely sure that Potter was going to “do the right thing” and give back the money. Even when the whole town converged at the Bailey residence, I was just waiting for the villain to make an appearance and profess to his sins. But, it just never happened. Potter was just bad to the bone – pure evil (“Happy New Year to you…in jail”)! Ebenezer Scrooge should take lessons. The highlight for me though was the enormously outdated special effects. They really added an extra degree of humour to the film – although I have a strange feeling that even back in 1946 it still would have made the kids laugh. Despite the fact that the whole film looked like it was shot in a Hollywood studio, visually the film was quite beautiful. Shooting in Black & White was a great move – even though they had colour at that stage. I loved the old broken down house Mary and George eventually moved into. It kind of reminded me of the Adam’s Family house – so much character, so much history, and so much potential! Something else that stood out for me was the minimal use of music. Unlike a lot of films today – especially Christmas films – were the audience is bombarded with audio content, “It’s a Wonderful Life” only made use of an orchestral score when it really needed to for propelling the story along. Although I must admit, that some of the Foley work really reminded me about the whole “shooting in a studio” thing – which was kind of distracting. This is one of those “feel good” movies, which seems almost typical now days. It’s a magnificent Christmas movie – even though the message behind the screenplay isn’t really about the holiday season at all – although it still has NOTHING on Brian Henson’s 1992 “The Muppet Christmas Carol”. I mean, how can James Stewart possibly compete with Rizzo the Rat (“Mother always taught me…never eat singing food”)!

After Joel comes to the realisation that Clementine, being the spontaneous women that she is, has actually erased all memories of him, in an act of self-gratification, he decides to do exactly the same. But as the technicians carefully eradicate his past, he begins to realise that despite all the fights and unpleasant moments the couple has been through, there were also so many wonderful and breathtaking memories that he never wants to forget. So, in an effort to stop the irreversible damage, with the assistance of his minds recreation of Clementine (an interesting notion in itself!), together they try and hide from the erasing technicians in a surreal pursuit through Joel’s mind.","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Internet Movie Database Inc., viewed 23 October 2006, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338013/.","Every once in a while you sit down on your couch, fire up the DVD player and watch something that completely blows you away. It doesn’t happen very often, but when it does, it truly affects you as a human being. It takes a lot of extraordinary ingredients to pull off a masterpiece; a lot of sheer talent and a huge amount of luck (just look at the circus parade scene!). The first element you need is a great idea – something that sparks intrigue and imagination. A concept that is simple yet can be built upon to create a complex and intricate screenplay. When a friend of Michel Gondry(the director of Eternal Sunshine) came to him with the idea that someone sends you a letter informing you that you’ve been erased from their memory, his mind raced into action. He contacted Charlie Kaufman, the Academy Award-nominated screenwriter of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, who took up the challenge and helped transform that simple notion into an exhilarating and multifaceted screenplay. Once the words were on the page, it was then time to convert them into something that an audience can watch, listen and most importantly, feel.","Feld, R 2004, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Shooting Script, Newmarket, USA.","Gondry, M 2004, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, DVD, Focus Features, USA.","How happy is the blameless Vestal’s lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray’r accepted, and each wish resign’d.","Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, despite a tremendously challenging and demanding screenplay exceeds expectations in all departments. The script has so many challenges, (for example, if you have somebody having their memories erased how can they still be cognizant of their memories that were erased so that there’s a smooth flow to the story?), and yet Kaufman and Gondry pull it off without a hitch. The film explores some very relevant and very real issues in regards to love, relationships and life in general. As human beings we seem to instantly think about the negative aspects of a person when a relationship comes to an end, as Joel did, in an attempt to make everything “right” in our own minds. What this movie suggests is that most of the time, when breaking down a relationship moment by moment, the good outweighs the bad. Too many moments in life are wasted on logic and commonsense. When it comes to love, one must live in the moment. You’ve only got one shot at life – so you have to live every second like it will be your last. Eternal Sunshine promotes the philosophy of living in the present and not getting caught up in the past. Whether or not you agree with Kaufman and Gondry is up to personal opinion, but there is no disagreement that a lot of time, love and heartache have been injected into this masterpiece of a film.","References:","Set in New York, the film centres on the life of Joel, your average kind of guy, although very shy and almost socially inept, especially when it comes to communicating with the opposite sex. He’s also not one to run on impulses or gut feelings, but rather relies on logic and common sense. Played by Jim Carrey, this is a character that is very enclosed, only revealing his true feelings and emotions to the confines of his journal. Although he has had girlfriends in the past (his previous partner Naomi is mentioned in the film), they have never really meant anything to him. It would seem that he has never had a serious relationship in his life. This all changes when Clementine enters his normally self-contained world. “No jokes about my name” she warms him when they first meet. He doesn’t know any (a subtle clue that reveals its significance later). Played by Kate Winslet, Clementine is almost the complete opposite of Joel – she’s feisty, impulsive, immature and brutally honest. But despite their obvious differences, they fall madly in love with each other. Things start off great, but like in so many relationships, the initial flame slowly fades away. After a period of trying to get their relationship working fluidly, they take a turn for the worst and following a heated argument, Clementine leaves Joel. But, this is nothing new to moviegoers as most love stories follow this familiar path. However, the film then takes the audience by surprise when Clementine acts as if she doesn’t even recognise her former lover when he visits her at the bookstore she works at. Completely devastated, Joel soon discovers that Clementine has had her memory of Joel completely erased.","Some of the lighting techniques are truly incredible, such as when only a small spotlight is attached to the camera allowing the operator to focus intensively on individual objects and people. Another example of clever lighting design is when Clementine appears to be erased into darkness during the train station scene in Joel’s mind. By simply using one soft edged profile light, the director and cinematographer achieve a look in camera that looks amazing and complex.","The acting in this film is something to be admired. Both Carrey and Winslet totally escape their usual typecasts, and do an exceptional job of bringing the convoluted story concept to life with characters that are believable, endearing, and scarily familiar. The fact that Gonry is able to create a believable and solid relationship between Mr. Ace Ventura and Mrs. Rose DeWitt Bukater is a true credit to him, as at first glances, the two actors seem very incompatible. But that’s exactly the point of the film! It is not the stuff on the outside that counts; it’s the memories and the experiences that should define a relationship. The supporting cast are just as impressive, with Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood(straight from the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and Kiersten Dunst helping propel the plot acting as staff members from Lacuna Inc. Rob and Carrie, played by David Cross and Jane Adams add some comic relief to the film; a couple that seems to be suffering from similar issues as the main protagonists.","The cinematography of the film (led by Ellen Kuras) is yet another strong point of the film. Most of the camera shots used are either handheld or steady-cam, which gives the movie a very realistic and natural feel. The camera frame is constantly changing, which gives the images an added degree of life. It is also quite jerky in scenes, but for some reason it doesn’t distract. The vibrant costume design helps bring out some fantastic colours – the bold orange colour of Clementine’s jumper and her flamboyant hair dyes give her character another dimension of intrigue and make her standout from the natural, yet very beautiful locations. Dr. Howard’s blue tie is another example of a skilful costume decision that comes out magnificently on film. The way both Kuras and Gondry experiment with the focus of shots is also most interesting, as they tend to use a shallow depth of field for some of the more close up and personal shots, even if that means one of the key actors in the scene is out of focus. The focus is also very slow at adjusting in some of the close up shots when the actor gets closer or further away to/from the camera, which is a welcome change from the always perfect focus selection of most Hollywood films.","The musical score, put together by Joh Brion(who previously composed the music for films such as Magnolia), is one of the more subtle aspects of the film, but actually plays one of the most important roles. The recurring musical motif that first appears at the very start of the film helps set the tone of the film and strongly compliments the pictures on the screen. It’s a very friendly and simple piano melody, which is also terribly catchy. The musical score is very appropriate to the style of the film, and never detracts or interferes from the images on screen. But at the same time it is very manipulative, as it seriously plays with the emotions of its listeners. It really makes you feel for the characters.","This is one of the most brilliant stories to ever hit the big screen. The concepts and feelings built into the complex script are both perplexing and rewarding. But not only does Kaufman and Gondry tell the story of Joel and Clementine, whilst one plotline is taking place in the mind of Joel, back in the “real world” a whole additional subplot is developed exploring the complicated relationships between the staff of Lacuna Inc. This is a film that carefully bounces between several different time zones. It opens with a scene from the present, jumps back to the past to when the couple have just broken up, then goes further into the past via Joel’s memory, whilst continually cutting back to outside of Joel’s mind. It then repeats the opening scenes and continues the story. But, the beautiful thing is that despite the fact that the timeline is disjoined, and basically complete and utter chaos, as a viewer you never get lost. Kaufman is truly the master of time travel.","Ultimately, Eternal Sunshine is a story about love – an experience that everyone will no doubt face at some stage in their journey through life. Inevitably we will one day come across someone that fascinates us so deeply that we feel as though we could spend the rest of your life with this magnetic and seemingly irreplaceable individual. No one can truthfully claim to understand the exact science of love, and in most cases it appears to be more irrational, illogical and unreasonable than anything else. Why we find ourselves attracted to people who are almost the polar opposite of ourselves remains one of life’s little mysteries. Love is completely bewildering and yet at the same token, absolutely fulfilling. It has also been done to death in the movie making world. But unlike the multitude of traditional love stories you see in video stores, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind skilfully dodges all clichés.","Visually and technically speaking this film is also brilliant. Instead of relying on fancy digital special effects like so many other Hollywood films, Gondry uses more traditional methods to achieve amazing results. Instead of using a blue screen, he chose to do the majority of his effects on camera, by manipulating the perspective and position of objects, making use of trapdoors in custom build sets and quickly changing things when they go briefly off-camera. Even when digital effects are used, such as when Joel drives after Clementine following their final dispute, the computer effects are minimal and are mostly used to composite several different sections of video footage together as opposed to recreating a whole scene artificially. This helps to reaffirm that the footage is believable, despite the science-fiction-like storyline plus also ensures that the effects serve a necessary function; that they do not distract the audience from the story. One of the most memorable scenes is when Clementine magically gets from the bathroom to the kitchen and then to the living room – a sequence which was all done in camera with no computer trickery. These techniques also help keep the budget down, which would have pleased producers Steve Golin and Anthony Bregman!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"GPS raises significant issues of mobile privacy","p":["The government’s been in bed with the entire telecommunications industry since the forties. They’ve infected everything. They get into your bank statements, computer files, e-mail, listen to your phone calls…. Every wire, every airwave. The more technology used, the easier it is for them to keep tabs on you. It’s a brave new world out there. At least it better be…Brill from the film 'Enemy of the State' (Touchstone Pictures 1998)","In Tony Scott’s 1998 blockbuster, “Enemy of the State”, a successful Washington DC lawyer is hunted down by a government intelligence group, after he is inadvertently given a video tape revealing the murder of a congressman. As he attempts to gather the facts with the intention to release them to the public’s eye, the full weight of the government’s surveillance equipment is swung into action – everything from coin size bugging devices and telephone location tracing to real-time satellite surveillance. The lawyer’s bank details, phone records and other extremely personal details are brought up and manipulated with ease by the government using their extensive computer networks (Touchstone Pictures 1998). Although at the time of the movies release the majority of the technology displayed in this film appeared far fetched and extremely unlikely. Step forward seven years and most, if not all of the equipment, suddenly seems all the more plausible.","Global Positioning Systems, or GPS as it is more commonly referred to, is one such technology that transforms science fiction into reality. It is a satellite-based navigation system, made up of 24 satellites placed into orbit by the United State Department of Defence, making it possible for people back on earth to pinpoint their geographic location using a receiver unit (Garmin 2000, p. 1). At the time of the films release technologies such as GPS did exist, however, unlike the equipment portrayed in the movie the accuracy of these devices was far from perfect. However, in more recent times, by using more advanced technologies such as Carrier-Phase Enhancement (CPGPS), the accuracy of GPS device has increased to within twenty to thirty centimetres (Wikipedia 2006). Even more astonishingly, some Differential GPS (DGPS) systems claim to be accurate to around one centimetre (Wikipedia 2006). It would seem that Hollywood has once again made some very accurate speculations of what the future would hold.","One of the key factors for the success of “Enemy of the State” was that it highlighted the potential for governments to invade the privacy of its citizens. Audiences worldwide were terrified of the possibility that intelligence organisations such as the National Security Agency had the potential to record their phone calls and track their movements even though most considered the technology to be quite some time away. Several years have passed since the films release, and now GPS is increasingly being adopted by private and public sectors to track and monitor humans for Location Based Services (LBS)(Wikipedia 2006). For example, current applications include locators for children, the elderly or those suffering from severe memory loss, and the monitoring of individuals for law enforcement, security or personal protection purposes (Dempsey 2001). The constant miniaturisation of GPS technology means that receivers can now take the form of wristwatches and be placed inside mobile phones and jewellery, all with the ability to pinpoint the exact longitude and latitude of a subject, twenty four hours a day – seven days a week. The purpose of this essay is to consider and explore the issues of mobile privacy that are raised in relation to Global Positioning Systems, and to analyse the emerging ethical concerns facing current and future GPS applications. Specific focus will be directed towards surveillance and identity, as most citizens in Australia believe they should have the right to remain anonymous if they so wish.","Although the technology behind GPS is quite complex, the theory behind how the system functions is relatively straightforward. GPS satellites circle the earth twice a day, travelling in a very strict orbit and constantly transmit signal information back towards the earth. Receiver units take this information and use triangulation to calculate the user’s exact location. Essentially, the GPS receiver compares the time a signal was transmitted by a satellite with the time it was received. This difference in time is then used to calculate how far away the satellite is. The receiver must be locked on to at least three satellite signals in order to calculate the 2D position – that is, the longitude and latitude. If the receiver is able to obtain the signal from four or more satellites, it can then determine the user’s 3D position: longitude, latitude and now altitude. With this continuously updated data, software within the device can then plot a user’s position against map information, and calculate other details such as speed, trip distance, distance to destination and other useful information (Garmin 2000, p. 1-16). Although GPS is fundamentally a passive mechanism, in that it does not inherently transmit location information to any other device, it can be combined with transmitters and transponders allowing the data to be transmitted to another party – hence the potential danger (Clarke 2000).","The benefits of the technology are quite obvious – people now no longer have any excuse for getting lost. Another useful example is of that of “Enhanced-911” in the United States. Prior to 2001, if you called 911 on a mobile phone but were unable to talk, or the signal dropped out before you could alert the operator of your location, emergency services had no way of determining where you are. This could potentially result in a loss of human life. However, with the development of Enhanced-911, emergency services can now determine the geographic location of the caller instantly to within fifty metres (Allen 2006). Although no one can object to the fact that it is a truly incredible life-saving tool, with it comes several potential issues. The implementation of the system has, and continues to cost mobile telephone companies millions of dollars, as they are required to update their infrastructure and their client’s phones to comply with FCC regulations (Said & Kirby 2006). Because of this, one of the ways these telecommunications companies can recover their losses is by partnering with organisations that offer location-based services allowing vendors, for example, to send messages to their customers when they are in the vicinity alerting them to discounts or reminding them that their current hire is overdue. The hope is that customers will appreciate receiving information that is specially customised to their location and interests; however, there is the threat that this new technology will create with it a bombardment of mobile phone spam and much more significantly and dangerously, jeopardize phone customers’ privacy (Said & Kirby 2006).","The theory behind Location-based Commerce, as it is known, is that as one goes about their everyday business, their mobile phone will provide them with useful information, based on their current location (Said & Kirby 2006). Another example is that a theatre might transmit a message to any previous customers nearby alerting them that as their upcoming performance has unsold seats, they are offering a substantial discount on their sale. In principle, this system is very handy, as it helps both the business who may sell more tickets, and the customer who may not have known that the show was on. However in practise, imagine if you were walking through a shopping complex and every individual store that you have purchased from in the past suddenly started to send you messages? Although government organisations such as the Australian Communications and Media Authority attempt to prohibit unsolicited messages and advertising, and customers should, in theory, have complete control over who can send them messages, in reality due to the nature of the technology, this is very hard to manage. Anyone can purchase an almost untraceable pre-paid phone and send junk mail to whomever they please. However, this is hardly the major concern. In the United States, because all mobile phone must support Enhanced-911, that means every phone must have the ability to receive GPS information, which as a result means that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has the ability, after receiving a court order, to determine your exact location at any time (Allen 2000). It should be noted that it is extremely difficult for the FBI to actually gain the court order, and they have been rejected in the past (Chestnutt 2006), however, there are loopholes which law enforcement agencies (and their friends in government agencies) have been known to use and abuse (Clarke 2000), making the Enemy of the State plot seem so much more conceivable. The simple fact remains that if the government wanted to spy on you in the United States – the technology exists for them to do so. Luckily for Australians, an Enhanced-000 service currently does not exist, meaning that it is not a requirement for all mobile phones to contain a GPS device. However, emergency services can still determine your approximate location to within 50 to 500 metres by determining how far away you are from phone communication towers (ACMI 2006).","But it is not just the Federal Bureau of Investigation that is making use of GPS technology. In July of 2003, Robert Moran, a lawyer with supposed links to the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and suspected of selling illegal drugs, had a GPS tracing device placed on his car by the New York State Police(McCullagh 2005). The police made the decision to utilise GPS technologies as opposed to more traditional means (like undercover officers), as they believed this was the only way to gain access into the tremendously cautious organisation. The police monitored Moran’s travels from a distance, and eventually arrested him on drug charges a month later (McCullagh 2005). But the most interesting aspect of this particular case is that a federal judge ruled that the police did not need court authorisation for the GPS tracking to take place. United States District JudgeDavid Hurt stated that “law enforcement personnel could have conducted a visual surveillance of the vehicle as it travelled on the public highways” and therefore “Moran had no expectation of privacy in the whereabouts of his vehicle on a public roadway”(McCullagh 2005). Although Moran was eventually found guilty on charges of conspiracy and drug trafficking, the important thing to keep in mind is that the police were allowed and are still allowed to track anyone they suspect has committed a crime, even if there is no substantial evidence to back the claim (Bray 2005). Do the police have the right to put someone under GPS surveillance without visiting a judge? According to US Attorney David Grable, yes “since it’s not a search, you don’t need any justification to use any one of these devices” (Bray 2005). However, should they have the right, is a completely different question. Australia is no different to the United States, except as there is a smaller percentage of police per citizen, there are fewer resources to devote to tracking people without ample evidence, therefore there is less potential for GPS tracking to take place – however, the possibility is still there (A.I.C 2006). For example, seven years after MP John Newman was murdered in 1994, the police used mobile phone records to determine that Phuong Ngo, a former Fairfield local councillor and suspect, was in the vicinity of the murder, and also, later that night, near the location where the murder weapon was found (The World Today 2001). Not all people agree with using this kind of technology. In 2004, Nassau County Court Judge Joseph Calabrese stated that “at this time, more than ever, individuals must be given the constitutional protections necessary to their continued unfettered freedom from a ‘big brother’ society” (New York Daily News 2005).","But it’s not just the government and law enforcements that have their eye on GPS: companies are using it to spy on their workers; wives are using it to keep tabs of their husbands, mothers of their children. GPS devices are being built into more and more automobiles and are being embedded into mobile phones (Bray 2005). At the end of the day however, the more people that utilise GPS technology, the easy it is for authorities to keep track of everyone. In theory a database could be set up maintaining a list of where everyone is or was at any given time. Enemy of the State could become reality. And as long as those cars or phones are on public roads, the users have no right to object (Bray 2005). However, what the courts failed to consider in the US, is that tracking people via GPS is very different from keeping tabs of them on foot or by vehicle. Before GPS existed, the limited budgets and the lack of man power restricted officers from following anyone they please. But with a cheap and widespread technology like GPS the temptation to engage in casual surveillance may become irresistible (Bray 2005). Although there are obviously benefits to GPS technology the potential for unethical surveillance and monitoring are too great to ignore. With information comes power – and with GPS devices widely spread throughout society, anyone that has access to this data holds the upper hand. Allowing the FBI (or their international equivalent) to have access to this information is scary enough – but what if there systems become compromised and a criminal gains access? Or what if the government officials are corrupt? Sure there are monitors in place, but as Carla Dean states in Enemy of the State, “who’s gonna monitor the monitors of the monitors” (Touchstone Pictures 1998)…"]},{"l":"References","p":["A.I.C 2006, Sworn police officers in Australia, Australian Institute of Criminology, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/cfi/cfi116/","ACMA 2006, Mobile Originating Location Information, Australian Communications and Media Authority, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.acma.gov.au/ACMAINTER.131352:STANDARD:1884699275:pc=PC_7251","Adomatis, D 2006, Using the GPS for People Tracking, Turner Endeavors, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.travelbygps.com/articles/tracking.php","Allen, G 2006, Wireless 911 Information, DISPATCH Monthly Magazine, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.911dispatch.com/911/wireless911/","Allen, G, 2000, The Wireless 911 Web, Allen Media, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.911dispatch.com/911/wireless_911web/","Bray, H 2005, GPS Spying May Prove Irresistible to Police, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/01/17/gps_spying_may_prove_irresistible_to_police?mode=PF","Chestnutt, A 2006, Cell Phone GPS Tracking – Privacy Issues, EzineArticles, viewed 20 September 2006, http://ezinearticles.com/?Cell-Phone-GPS-Tracking—Privacy-Issues&id=159255","Clarke, R 2000, Person-Location and Person-Tracking: Technologies, Risks and Policy Implications, Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/DV/PLT/","Clarke, R 2001, While You Were Sleeping… Surveillance Technologies Arrived, Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/DV/AQ2001/","Clarke, R 2006, Introduction to Dataveillance and Information Privacy, Xamax Consultancy Pty Ltd, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/DV/Intro/","Dempsey, C 2001, Uses for GPS, GIS Lounge, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.gislounge.com/features/aa050901a.shtml","Garmin Corporation 2000, GPS Guide for Beginners, Garmin International, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.garmin.com/manuals/GPSGuideforBeginners_Manual.pdf","McCullagh, D 2005, Snooping by Satellite, CNET Networks, viewed 20 September 2006, http://news.com.com/2102-1028_3-5533560/?tag=st.util.print","New York Daily News 2005, Federal judge’s ruling on use of GPS worries privacy advocates, Infowars.com, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.infowars.com/articles/bb/ruling_on_gps_worries_privacy_advocates.htm","Roy Morgan Research 2004, Community Attitudes Towards Privacy 2004, The Office of the Federal Privacy Commissioner, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/rcommunity/index/","Said, C & Kirby, C 2001, GPS Cell Phones May Cost Privacy, San Francisco Chronicle, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/19/BU155366.DTLtype=tech_article","Scott, T 1998, Enemy of the State, DVD, Touchstone Pictures, USA.","The World Today 2001, NSW MP’s Killer Sentenced, Australian Broadcasting Commision, viewed 20 September 2006, http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s416677.htm","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Global Positioning System, Wikipedia, viewed 20 September 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Global_Positioning_Systemoldid=76694515","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Location-based Service, Wikipedia, viewed 20 September 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Location-based_serviceoldid=76720378"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Philosophy of Open Source"},{"l":"Introduction","p":["The purpose of this document is to explain the philosophy behind Open Source. It will first examine the definition of the term, then reveal its history, and finally, explore how the philosophy is affecting all areas of society – not just the information technology world. At the end of this document is a bibliography, allowing you to continue to research this fascinating, and increasing more significant topic, if you wish.","So, what exactly is Open Source?","Although, as suggested in the introduction, open source philosophies can be applied to all areas of society, when first learning about this topic it is probably easiest to think about it in terms of computer software. Chances are – although in the future this may no longer be the case – you are viewing this website using a personal computer running an operating system such as Microsoft’s Windows or Apple’s Mac OS. Both are examples of proprietary systems. By proprietary, I mean to say that all the code hidden behind the software (the ones and zeros) are not accessible by people outside of the company that owns it. For most major commercial companies (such as Adobe and Sony), their software’s source code is considered to be a trade secret, and access to this code by third parties would normally mean that one would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement and other legally binding papers (Source: Wikipedia 2006). So, simply put, your average computer programmer simply does not have the ability to modify propriety software in its entirety without permission from the owner.","For example, Microsoft does not allow anyone to view the guts of its Windows operating system, but instead gives programmers the ability to use API calls that allowing them to access specific portions of the proprietary code and make use of them; however no modification can take place (Source: Moylan 2006). This means that a programmer can get the job done and Microsoft continues to have complete control over their creation. On the face of it, everyone wins. However it does limit the programmer’s creativity, and makes his or her life a lot harder.","Open Source software on the other hand, upholds the belief that the source code of software should be available to anyone to easily view, alter, enhance and re-distribute any portion of that code without paying for it (Source: Moylan 2006). For example, with an Open Source operating system, such as Linux, if you decide you don’t like the way the system handles something and you have a programming background, you can modify any aspect of the computer software to suit your own personal needs. If you don’t like the way a button looks, or the way a menu opens – then feel free to tweak the code. You can add, edit, and destroy to your hearts content.","Still confused? Steve Weber, in his book ‘The Success of Open Source’ uses a simple analogy to Coca-Cola to explain the difference between open source and proprietary products. He explains that when you purchase a can of Coke, you are allowed to drink it, and you are also given a generic and vague list of ingredients on the side of the can. But Cola-Cola do not tell you the specifics – they don’t give you the complete recipe. Their secret formula is exactly that, secret – locked in a vault somewhere, with one a few people privileged enough to know what makes up the addictive syrup. Purchasing a can of coke does not give you the right to learn the secret. This is exactly the same with commercial software. Purchasing a copy of Microsoft Windows does not give you the right to the source code (i.e. the recipe that tells you exactly how the program was made).","Open Source projects are usually community-based projects built by programmers who donate their time and expertise to create a product that the marketplace is in need of, regardless of whether or not there is a possibility of financial gain (Source: Moylan 2006). In fact, whole virtual communities have been established where geeks worldwide can work together to create software that will hopefully make their lives easier or just more fun. For example, SourceForge.net (at the time of writing) has 128,465 registered projects, and 1,382,867 registered users. All these people work together to create software that anyone, anywhere can modify and customise to suit their personal desires. Open source is about freedom and liberty – not about price."]},{"l":"The Definition of Open Source","p":["To determine whether something can be considered “open source” or not, the Open Source Initiative developed a definition based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted – for the most part – by Bruce Perens(Source: OSI 2006). The Ten Commandments that he came up with are as follows:","Free Redistribution","Freely Obtainable Source Code","Derived Works","Integrity of the Author’s Source Code","No Discrimination against Persons or Groups","No Discrimination against Fields of Endeavour","Distribution of License","License Must Not Be Specific to a Product","License Must Not Restrict Other Software","License Must Be Technology-Neutral","Take for example a computer program license. For the license to be considered open source, the program must be able to be given away or sold without restraint. The source code must be freely obtainable (either it should come with the program, or available on the Internet for free download). End users must be allowed to redistribute any modifications they make (however depending on the license, some modifications must be redistributed as patches, as to not interfere with the original code). The program should not discriminate against individuals or corporations (i.e. Bill Gates has just as much right to open source software as anyone else). The appropriate license should be travel with the program (or again, be available on the Internet). The program cannot be licensed only as part of a larger distribution but can be distributed with other software that is not considered open source. And finally, the license must not contain any medium specific terms of accepting the license agreement (i.e. it can’t state “to agree to this license click the ‘OK’ button on such-and-such webpage – as websites may become obsolete in the future)."]},{"l":"The History of Open Source","p":["Open Source philosophy has been around for a very long time. There are books dedicated to its history, so I will not go into too much detail, as this is not the focus of this document. But basically, it started with hackers such as Richard Stallman, spending huge amounts of time writing software, but instead of selling it for financial gain they wanted to share their work with fellow users (Source: Kidd 2006). They wanted people to learn from what they had made, and improve upon it. Out of respect, any changes that someone makes should be given back to the hacker community, so everyone can learn more from the additions, therefore improving their skills. This sharing of ones ideas and creation was purely based on good moral principles – money, fame and glory did not come into the equation.","The actual term, “open source” however first surfaced on the 3rd of February 1998, during a strategy session in California, after Netscape (creators of an internet browser called Netscape Navigator – which sparked the browser wars with Microsoft in the 90’s), decided to release the code to their software to the world (Source: OSI 2006). They decided that the term “free software” was too confrontational, and “open source” was the best thing they could come up with at the time. So although open source philosophy has existed for many, many years (as stated previously, the open source definition is based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines), it was only in 1998 that it became a recognisable term."]},{"l":"Popular Open Source Examples","p":["Even though you may be unaware of it, chances are you make use of open source technology every day. To get you thinking, here are two of the more popular open source examples:","At the time of writing Mozilla Firefox is currently one of the most popular open source software projects going around. With features such as tabbed browsers, integrated search, live bookmarks and a generally faster user experience, it is a lot more feature packed and friendly than proprietary products such as Internet Explorer. Despite the fact that Microsoft and Apple have multimillion dollar development budgets, their browser software is currently being beaten by something developed by the people.","Wikipedia, an open source encyclopaedia is also taking the World Wide Web by storm. Containing over five million articles in a large number of languages, the site is claimed to be one of the top twenty most visited sites on the Internet (Source: Alexa Internet 2006). Anyone can modify the content on Wikipedia, which is one of the key ingredients to its success."]},{"i":"other-markets","l":"Other Markets…","p":["The open source philosophy has grown across a large amount of different markets – not just the computer industry. For example, in the agriculture industry, open source beer has been created, such as Vores Øl and Free Beer 3.0. The recipes for both of these beers are freely available on the Internet, released under a Creative Commons License. In the health world, organisations such as the Tropical Disease Initiative have been founded investigating open source pharmaceutical development. Content is also a big area, with websites such as Wikipedia(an open source encyclopaedia) and Yellowikis(an open source version of the Yellow Pages) growing bigger and stronger every day. We have already discussed open source software in a fair degree of detail, but open source hardware is also existent. For example, the designs of microchips have been released under open source licensing agreements."]},{"i":"blogging","l":"Blogging!","p":["Blogging can also be considered open source, as people are contributing their time and expertise in areas in which they are often not compensated financially. When a blogger reports from a first-hand account, they are in effect “exposing source code” for other people to comment on, enhance and re-distribute (Source: Moylan 2006). The blogger can either take their blogs (their “source code”) and sell it, or promote it for free – just like with open source software. Incidentally, a lot of the web site software used on blogging sites is also open source, such as LifeType."]},{"i":"society--culture","l":"Society & Culture","p":["Open Source technology is thought to be revolutionary because it promotes concepts of sharing and universal participation. Some believe that this revolution will take us back to the community based ideals of oral cultures, but the thing that puzzles most people about these organisations is that they are non-profitable. There has been a lot of thought put into why these people volunteer their time to set up such outlets and to contribute their information property without any economic remuneration. Demos, “the think tank for everyday democracy”, believe that we are experiencing a historic shift from the rise of the professional in the late 20th Century to a new phenomenon of people “pursuing amateur activities”, calling this the “Pro-Am Revolution”(Source: Demos 2006). It is believed that this so-called revolution has the potential to strengthen the democratic world by pushing “power to the edges” and to help potential new organisations and leadership emerge through the incubation of this “mega community”. Goetz likens Open Source to an “ant colony” and believes that “the collective intelligence of the network supersedes any single contributor” (Source: Goetz 2003).","Open source principles have also affected other areas of society and culture, such as politics (i.e. open and collaborative formation of public policy) and journalism (i.e. on-line non-for-profit journalism). Open Source Filmmaking is also starting to gain momentum. One example is Elephants Dream, an animated film created only using open source software, with all the production files available for free download. This means anyone can download and modify the film, distribute it and share their updated version to the internet community."]},{"i":"open-source-problemsissues","l":"Open Source Problems/Issues","p":["Like anything, open source does not come without its problems. Luckily though, a lot of the issues of the past are slowly becoming less relevant in more recent times. Compatibility and comparability were once the main topics of conversations when talking about open source, but now some open source technology has become so advanced that it is almost completely compatible and comparable with its proprietary equivalents (for example, with software like WINE, you can run a large portion of Windows-based software on a Linux-based system; you can also open Microsoft Word documents in Open Office).","However there are issues with open source licensing. The main issues that arise are that of ownership. Technically and legally speaking, current open source licenses do not clearly define ownership rights, and therefore there is a possibility that someone could use the open source agreements to take advantage of others peoples hard work, and not give back to the community.","There are also problems with the actual term “open source”. Sometimes the term is used to describe software whose source code is visible, but there are limitations on what can be done with it. For example, you may be able to view the source code, but you may not be allowed to modify it and redistribute it. There is also some confusion between open source software and free software."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Open source philosophy is changing the way people think about technology and society. A couple of years ago you had to fork out a lot of money to get a good graphics editing computer program (such as Adobe Photoshop). Now you can just download a free version of GIMP. You can even modify its source code to make it better, or simply different, if you feel so inclined. Collaborative open source software projects such as Linux and Apache(a web server package) have demonstrated that a large and complex system of code can be built, maintained, developed and extended in a non-proprietary environment (Source: Weber 2004, p. 2). Outside of the computer world, people have created open source beer and cola. Vast amounts of informative content are being release as open source on sites such as Wikipedia. Blogging is becoming a household term, with people globally sharing their views and thoughts for free to anyone who wants to listen, watch or read. Even open source pharmaceutical development is on the horizon.","Despite the fact that most people would have never predicted that a system based around people working for free would work, open source philosophy is making a big impact. The thing to understand is that open source embraces the philosophy of sharing, and because of this, concepts such as piracy are no longer a problem. You are encouraged to share and spread open source products as much as you like. You can copy and redistribute, even after modification. This provides users with a freedom that is not obtainable from proprietary products (as illustrated right throughout this document), and creates remarkable opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs around the world, especially in developing countries."]},{"l":"References","p":["Alexa Internet 2006, Top 500 Web Sites, viewed 8th September 2006, http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500","Kidd, E 2000, A History of “Open Source”, UserLand Software, viewed 8th September 2006, http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg019844/","Moylan, C 2006, The Philosophy of Open Source, Associated Content Inc., viewed 8th September 2006, http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/32264/the_philosophy_of_open_source/","Open Source Initiative 2006, History of the OSI, viewed 8th September 2006, http://www.opensource.org/docs/history.php","Open Source Initiative 2006, The Open Source Definition, viewed 8th September 2006, http://opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php","Weber, S 2004, The Success of Open Source, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Closed Source, Wikipedia, viewed 8th September 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Closed_sourceoldid=71562909","Goetz, T 2003, Open Source Everywhere, Wired Magazine, viewed 8th September 2006, http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/opensource/","Demos 2006, The Pro-Am Revolution, viewed 8th September 2006, http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/proameconomy"]},{"l":"External Links","p":["A History of Open Source","A quick history of Open Source…","An open-source shot in the arm?","Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm (PDF)","Elephants Dream","Fighting Raymondism","Free Beer Homepage","History of the OSI","History of Unix, Linux, and Open Source / Free Software","Neuros takes open source approach to hardware and software development","Open Source (Wikipedia)","Open Source Politics","Open Source Software","Open Source: Voices from the Open Source Revolution","Problems in Open Source Licensing","Problems of Open Source Software: Annotated Chronicle","Realizing the Promise of Open Source in the Non-profit Sector","The Cathedral and the Bazaar","The Great Software Debate: Technology and Ideology","The Origins and Future of Open Source Software","The Problems with Open Source","Vores Øl Homepage","Why “Free Software” is better than “Open Source”"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Documentary Interview Experiments","p":["As part of our Language and Communications class, we split into groups of four people and conducted a series of interviews. One person acted as camera tech, another sound tech, an interviewer and an interviewee. The purpose of the interview was to try and learn something about the interviewee that the interviewer didn’t previously know. It gave us a chance to consider documentary ethics, practise the technical aspects of documentary production, and to experiment with different interviewing styles.","Our group decided to use a very natural, down and dirty interview style. The interviewer and interviewee sat on the ground just casually chatting away. The camera was also on the ground, shooting in a black and white mode, handheld, shakily shooting angled headshots of the two people. The reason for this was primarily to do something different from all the other groups, but also as we were shooting on video (a very natural and realistic medium compared to film – video basically looks like Neighbours), we thought that we might as well not try and attempt to make it look like film. Shooting handheld, in black and white, and with poor lighting, took advantage of the rather grainy and comparably low-resolution of the DV format. The lighting of the scene was natural, with sunlight coming through the window striking the girls from above. Although it would have been nice to ‘tweak’ the look, possibly by simply using a reflector to bounce sunlight into the girl’s faces, we simply didn’t have the time. Audio wise, despite my objections, the boom microphone was placed in shot, in the centre of the two girls. This meant that the footage looked cluttered, but also meant the audio quality sounded very poor, as the ME66 is very directional. Although I was personally happy overall with the look of the film (despite the microphone being in shot), others suggested that it distracted them from what the people were saying, giving the footage a very unnatural feel. The interviewee and interviewer didn’t like the footage either, saying that by being on the ground, with all the other class members looking down on them, made them act in a contrived manner. Personally, I disagree. I believe that by shooting them in this way, when they are under quite a lot of pressure to deliver something interesting, brought out their true personality – even if it was just them panicking and struggling. Both the interviewee and interviewer insisted that they had no problem discussing ‘interesting’ topics off camera, but as soon as the camera was shooting, they were in struggle town. I think that maybe they were just too scared to discuss the things they were talking about off-camera to tape, because they would be judged by the audience. And although they didn’t talk about topics they did before the interview, the camera still managed to capture a reality of the situation. Watching the footage showed two girls struggling to find an interesting topic to talk about for the audience. I found the footage we captured fascinating. However, shooting in this style did affect the interview in a way I didn’t predict. It made the interviewer feel like she was on the same level as the interviewee, despite the fact there was a visual sense of hierarchy. What I mean is that it felt like the interviewer and interviewee had equal power. Despite the fact that only one person was asking the questions, it felt as is neither person was in complete control of the interview. So, by shooting in the style that we did, we effectively changed the whole feeling and pecking order of the interview. Is that a negative thing? For the purposes of this exercise, I think it was a positive. As this was only an experiment, it gave a valuable insight into documentary interviewing practises. However, I would probably not use this style for most documentary pieces, unless I was evaluating or investigating human communication or something similar. I think one of the main areas lacking in this interview was pre-interview, that is, defining a solid list of interview topics. I think the fact that little planning was done was the main reason the interview seemed so hard. The other thing that really annoyed me was the quality of the audio, not only due to the positioning, but also due to the handling noise of the boom pole.","Other groups used several different styles. Some had head shots of the interviewee, some had wide shots, some had the interviewer in frame, but all of the other groups kept the camera on tripod. Audio wise, everyone used the ME66 microphone and all the interviews (except the last one, in which I acted as boom operator – he says arrogantly!), had really poor sounding audio. The reason being, like our groups interview, the positioning was bad (shotgun mics work best shooting directly at the source’s mouth at around three to five feet away), the manual riding of the gain was overcompensating, and the ME66 is not really suitable for broadcast quality indoor audio capturing (a hyper-cardiod is preferred). Also the boom handling was also very poor, resulting in a lot of handling noise coming through the track. Although the operator is partly at fault for not holding the boom pole gently, the fact that no shock suspension is available doesn’t make the operator’s job any easier.","Generally speaking, the best interviews were the ones with the best content. It didn’t really matter how poorly the technical side of the production was. If the interview was interesting, you can forgive the poor audio quality and lousy framing. Although in some of the interviews the poor camera work was slightly distracting, such as when in one interview, the camera started panning down the interviewee’s body for no particular reason (completely unmotivated). As is always the way, the moment the camera was off the interviewees face, they said something really out of the ordinary. What did I learn? You should only move the camera when motivated to do so, and even then, you have to seriously think about it and predict what’s going to happen next.","One of the interviews had the interviewers head on the far left of frame out of focus, with the interviewer centre frame in focus, with the shotgun microphone also in view. This visual style was very distracting, and seemed to waste a lot of the frame space as the whole right side of the image was just white. The most visually appealing interviews I found were just generally static shots of the interviewee, with the occasional slow zoom or pan to add a bit of life to the footage. The fact that everyone’s footage was shot from on a tripod gave the interviews a very manufactured, yet professional feel, as if you were watching a news program or police interrogation.","With documentaries it’s my belief that there should always be an invisible line between the crew and the interviewee. Unfortunately, in some of the interviews this line was crossed and in some cases completely ignored. For instance, in one interview the focus changed from the interviewee to the interviewer as the boom operator started to ask him questions. The camera operator had to follow the action, and filmed the interviewer, leaving the interviewee off-camera, off-sound, and probably very bored. This destroyed the pacing and authenticity of the whole interview. The viewer, who was just starting to become interested in what the interviewee had to say, all of the sudden has to watch the crew interviewing each other. Very unprofessional! What made matter worse was when the interview eventually shifted its focus back to the interviewee, the camera person asked him an extremely hard pressing question, abruptly ending the interview, in a very contrived manner. However, this was only an experiment – so not hard feelings, just another lesson learnt.","The main things I learn out of the days efforts were that production values are important. To get good usable footage you need a good camera, audio and boom operator. If you have someone that doesn’t really know what they’re doing, the whole shoot can be jeopardised. Planning is also extremely important. If you don’t spend time planning interview questions, and developing a well thought out plan of attack, there is a good chance that nobody will have anything appealing to talk about. An invisible wall also has to be developed, and then everyone has to stay on their own side. As soon as a crew member steps from one side to the other, the whole interview is put at risk. The camera operator and sound technician just need to do their job as quietly and professionally as possible, without interrupting or distracting the interviewer or interviewee.","The other thing I realised was that you really need a clear plan of what you want to get out of the interview. If you do in there just wanting to ask a couple of questions, then you may come out with some good footage, but footage that you don’t know what to do with. For instance, in our group, we went in there trying to find something we didn’t know about the interviewee, but actually came out with footage that essentially just explores human interaction. Although the footage we captured was good, and very interesting, it wasn’t what we needed to complete the task at hand. This was the same with the interview in which the crew started getting involved in. It started off just a traditional interview, trying to find something new about the person, but ended up being a train wreck, with cast and crew asking each other unplanned questions. Because the interviewer wasn’t connecting with the interviewee on a personal level, the interviewee decided to act, instead of being himself. The result – just a big mess!","Ethical considerations also came into question when watching the different interviews. In one case, the interviewee admitted to recently loosing a girlfriend, offering the interviewer the opportunity to ask some very hard-pressed questions, but decided to ignore the topic and move on to something else. The reason – he didn’t want to ask a series of very personal questions as he didn’t know the interviewee very well. Was this the right thing to do? Maybe – it’s a tough one. The interview probably would have been a lot more interesting if the interviewer decided to pursue the topic. But he simply didn’t want to. Even when the interviewee corrected the interviewer when he mistakenly said the girlfriend came from the same town as the interviewee, the interviewer just changed the topic once more. Without question, the interviewer could have gotten a lot more out of the interviewee. However, his morals told him not to do it. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is, like I’ve said, hard to say. I guess as these interviews were filmed in a university with the whole class watching the filming take place, and knowing that the class will be analysing the footage at a later date – it was the safe decision to make. Better to only ask innocent questions than to risk the interviewee becoming completely overwhelmed or overly uncomfortable. However, in a real filming situation, I would probably say that it’s better to ask the tough questions. I mean, in all honesty, although the interviewee was very nervous, I don’t think he would have minded being asked questions about his ex-girlfriend (despite the fact that they only broke up a couple of days previous). This was even more apparent when the interviewee corrected the interviewer.","It seemed to me that because these were filmed in a university, and everyone in the class was watching, no one seemed to ask any heavy questions. Everyone played it safe so they didn’t get their hands burnt. On the more technical side, people took risks. Our group shot in a very unconventional manner; the complete opposite to everyone else. Some camera operators decided to take the camera off the interviewees head and film more random things (like panning down the interviewee’s body). Although these would be quite major risks in a professional environment, in the context of this experiment they were just further tests, to see if it worked.","My favourite interview had the interviewer asking the interviewee a series of great questions, but also a lot of very random questions. For example, “if you were a tree what tree would you be”? This caught the interviewee off guard in most cases, making for a really fascinating piece of footage. The interviewer established a really good connection with the interviewee, and I think these random questions really helped do this. The important lesson to be learnt out of this is that to get good interview footage a good relationship needs to be built between the interviewer and interviewee. They need to be comfortable with each other. If the interviewee is scared of the interviewer or vice versa, the footage will look forced, fake and probably unusable.","After looking at the various different groups’ footage, it’s clear that the questions asked by the interviewer are also very important. You need to ask open ended questions that interest the interviewee so that they talk casually and passionately about their view on the topic. Questions that just result in the interviewee answering yes or no hardly make for an interesting interview. But how do you know what types of questions to ask? I guess doing your research before the interview helps. If you know where the interviewee’s passions lie, you can ask questions that you know will generate a lot of gusto. But also I think it’s very important that the interviewer actually listens to what the interviewee is saying. They need to listen and base their next set of questions on the interviewee’s responses. In the interview where the crew started interviewing each other instead of the interviewee, obviously the interviewer wasn’t listening to the person he was asking questions to. If he was then the conversations would have never had changed viewpoints. This is also a very good example of the interviewee becoming intimidated by the interviewee and as a result, he spent way to much time talking, instead of listening. The result – a self obsessed interview that didn’t really work.","Overall, I found this experiment to be tremendously useful. Although a lot of the stuff learnt could be regarded as common sense, it’s always better to do it yourself and learn from your mistakes than by just reading a book or being told what’s what. It’s also extremely beneficial to test out all the interviewing practises yourself and then evaluate what you’ve done. It’s one thing to know how to do something – it’s something completely different to actually follow your own advice and wisdom. It takes a lot of self control, persistence and self-confidence to listen and follow to your own advice. It’s a lot easier to be lazy and say “it’ll do”. I also strongly believe practise makes perfect, so any chance of practising our skill is welcome in my books!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Elephant","p":["I have just realised that after half a year of studying film and television, my whole perspective of what makes a fantastic movie has changed. Last year, I would have said it has to entertain me and absorb me in its world. That’s still true – a good movie still must do this. However, I have started to believe that a good movie must also offer something new. It has to push boundaries. It has to challenge its viewers. It has to be groundbreaking. I knew this – it almost seems like common sense. However, I didn’t truly understand the concept. Movies like The Isle, 2:37 and The Book of Revelation, fit into the revolutionary category. Although all of them scared the hell out of me, and seriously made me wonder what I was doing watching them, I have grown, not only to appreciate them, but I now actually understand that they’re truly fantastic pieces of art and because of that, I have made the conscious decision to say “I like them”. Previously, I only appreciated them – I didn’t consider them compulsory viewing. I’ve change my opinion. I think you need to watch film like these, if you are going to become a filmmaker, so that you understand that the challenge is to create something that hasn’t been done before. To create something that will spark people’s imaginations. Make them angry – make them cry – whatever. Now, a lot of people have suggested that 2:37 is just a rip off of Elephant. Personally, I think that’s a bit of an over exaggeration. Yes, the cinematography is very similar. Some of the camera work is almost exactly the same. And yes, the sound design is very similar (which isn’t unpredictable seeing as the same person did both movies). And yes, the story does have its similarities – i.e. it’s about a high school that suffers a tragic event. However, after watching elephant for the first time, I came out of the room with a completely different feeling to when I left 2:37. After watching 2:37 I felt sick. I felt like I had just been tortured. However after watching Elephant, I felt something completely different. That’s why I don’t believe 2:37 is a rip off of Elephant. Although it has a lot of similarities, you leave the theatre feeling different emotions. It’s not so much about the sound design, or what’s shown on screen. It’s more about the feelings and emotions it sparks. That’s what film school has taught me thus far. It’s not about pretty pictures and nice sounding audio. It’s about a story that messes with the viewer. The story is everything. The story must evoke a passion in the viewer, whether it’s negative or positive. I’ve come to realise that that’s what filmmaking is all about.","Elephant, like 2:37 (although some would hate that I am comparing Elephant to 2:37 and not the other way round!), follows around several typical high school teenagers as they go about their normal school day – except all hell breaks loose at the end when two teenagers decide to shoot everyone. It opens with a car dangerously driving down a typical American suburban street, smashing into other cars as it goes. The driver is a drunken parent, attempting to take his teenage son to school. At this point, I was thinking that maybe Elephant was going to be exactly like 2:37 – an insight into the lives of several very troubled teens; based around a horrific mystery, with a gruesome climax. As it introduced more characters, the cheerleader, the football player, the outcast who spends her time in the library, I starting to think “here we go again”, but I soon realised I was wrong.","Unlike 2:37 these characters felt real. They didn’t feel like stereotypical American teen soapie characters. I felt like I was watching archive footage of real people whilst at school. What they said, and what they did wasn’t important. It was fairly random, and to be perfectly honest, boring. It was just a bunch of people at school – just another day at the office. It was almost like watching Big Brother. Groups of girls gossip in the canteen, a wannabe photographer develops his prints, a shy girl helps out in the library. That’s what made this movie a lot different to 2:37. It was a lot more random and a lot more detached. Although it only focussed on a few characters, you still never got close to knowing any of these people. You were basically shown them at their most boring. At although they did fit the stereotypical teenager moulds, I never really thought about that. I guess because, in reality, the big attractive alpha males are the ones playing footage, and the gorgeous teenage blondes are normally completely obsessed with their appearance. Or maybe it was simply because I knew something sick and evil was around the corner, and I was ignoring the film and just subconsciously waiting for that key event.","Forgetting about 2:37 for the time, the film has a very unique and stunning visual style. All the shots are either extremely smooth steady cam, or slowly panning and tilting crane shots. The smooth, almost floating camera work helps to underscore the feeling of this being another ordinary, empty and humdrum day at school. There is also some time lapse photography which helps to slow down the already slow paced film. The colour of the footage is surprisingly pale – for example, in reality bold red and yellow tee-shirts, are less striking, showing more texture and contrast, which helps portray a very “film look”. You think the film looks very nature, until you study each individual frame, and you realise that it doesn’t look real at all – it just looks like a beautiful movie frame; completely colour corrected and contrived. Although, I can’t work out way (apart from the fact it looks cool), the film also makes use of messing with time. For example, when John interacts with a dog, as the dog jumps into the air we are shown the dog in slow motion. It does look great – but why do it? Does it affect the story in any way? I don’t think so. The film also messes with time in another sense – scenes are constantly overlapped as we are shown stories from a different characters perspective. The film reminded me a lot of “2001: A Space Odyssey”, as it followed around the characters, with its haunting and hypnotic manner. You knew something bad was going to happen – you knew people were going to get hurt – you just didn’t know when. You just didn’t know who was going to survive.","The soundtrack is truly amazing. It really messes with your emotions. Music is used; however, only sparingly. Beethoven’s “Fur Elise” and “Piano Symphonies Nos. 14 & 2” are used within the film – the peaceful classical music adding to the sense of danger and mystery. “Fur Elise” is basically the theme song for Elephant, as there is a scene were one of the key characters is playing that song on the piano in his room. The reason I have a great respect for the soundtrack of this film, is that it’s not wall-to-wall music or sound effects. Everything is very subtle and unnerving. The soundtrack compliments the picture, in that it’s very random and unexplained. Sounds of unimportant conversations, general school atmospheres, dogs barking in the background, random natural sounds etc. are slowly faded in and out creating a confusing, yet simplistic aural soundscape. However, in the more dramatic scenes, especially towards the end of the film, as the images became more intense and horrific, so did the audio. More sounds were layered together, and the tempo of the score became faster. The sound designer made fantastic use of the stereo medium (as opposed to mono); swinging sound effects from left to right, making you feel as if you’re trapped in the building with the characters. Silence is also used to great effect. Sound wise, the film reminds me a lot like “Alien”. Both films take the natural sounds of the scene, and manipulate and add to them to create a feeling of terror and fear. Neither film overuses sound. Your ears are never feed too much information. In fact, a lot of the visual styles remind me of Alien as well. For example, although one is on a spaceship and another is at a school, the long dimly lit hallways scenes are very similar.","Watching this film at school made a huge impact on me. It makes it more real. At any moment someone could pull out a gun and there would be nothing I, nor anyone else, could do. Now that’s terrifying.","A lot of people have said that the film is pointless, doesn’t offer any insight, and is basically just a really bad movie. I disagree. Yes, it’s really hard to watch. To be honest, I really didn’t want to be sitting there watching or listening to the movie. I just wanted to run away. However, that’s what makes it so amazing. I still find it hard to believe a bunch of pixels on a screen, and some human manipulated soundtrack can evoke such powerful emotions. I really respect the fact that the filmmakers decided not to explain why the killers did what they did. There is no single explanation for such behaviour. The fact that the two murderers were having a hard time at school (being bullied by their peers), played violet video games, read gun magazines, and were apparently gay, could have been contributing factors – however they are definitely not sole explanations. No one knows why the killers did what they did. No one can really understand what was going through their heads. No one can truly claim to understand their sickness. I respect the fact that the filmmakers didn’t just make up some seemingly logical expansion. It’s easy to say they killed everyone because they were being bullied. But being bullied is not a good enough explanation.","The film also unpredictable – just like life. The misfit girl is not saved just because she is like the assassins. When a muscular seemingly impervious African-American student starts sneaking up on one of the killers, one presumes that he is going to save the day. However, he’s not a hero at all – just another disengaged student that thinks he’s invincible. But the reality is no one is invincible. If someone is pointing a gun at your face, there really is nothing you can do about it. If the person wants to kill you – he or she can. This is not a film about high school students, bullying, homosexuality, or love. It’s about the randomness of violence. This film could have easily been set in any other location and played by any age group (i.e. an office building). The outcome and the responses would have been the same.","The reason I think this film is so challenging to watch is that, even when people are getting shot left, right and centre, the pacing is still very slow and the actions very random. You are left just watching some of the most horrible events take place in front of your eyes, and yet, there is nothing you can do about it. There’s no real accessible reason for why it’s happening. There’s no sign of it stopping any time soon. The worst part is that the students in the building just don’t know what to do. Like the audience – they’re in shock.","Overall, it’s a remarkable movie. It’s a slow movie that shows the reality of a tragic and horrific event. It doesn’t offer any explanations as to why things turned out the way that they did. It only offers some random (and probably irrelevant) hints. The dialog is routine and monotonous, as is the action leading up to the slaughter. This is a movie that will set your brain and imagination into overdrive after viewing. So many questions are asked throughout the film and no answers are given. The cinematography is truly incredible, as is the petrifying soundtrack. It’s a painfully beautiful film, with a disconnected narrative that deliberately withholds closure. The filmmaker wants you to think about what you’ve just seen. There’s an unbearable tension right throughout the film, and when the onslaught eventually starts, it actually explodes on the screen, hitting you with a frightening energy that’s unforgettable and completely chilling. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the images of Alex and Eric walking through the school."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"In God We Trust","p":["As Robert stands in the middle of a street contemplating the text written on a coin, he is suddenly hit by a SUV and instantly killed.

It feels even better when the film has been produced by people from your own home country. Like Minds is a refreshingly new and unique Australian film (despite the fact that it is set in the UK), which is sure to make a huge impact in the box offices not only locally, but internationally as well.","Alex is an extremely intelligent and particularly smug seventeen-year-old private school student, attending an elite catholic boarding school, of which his father is headmaster; a fact that he uses to his advantage at every opportunity. When Alex is arrested and accused of murdering school peer Nigel, his influential father is quick to come to his defence. When the police department holding him captive soon come to the realisation that there is no concrete evidence to back their claims, they call upon the services of forensic psychologist Sally Rowe to determine whether or not Alex is in fact the merciless killer they assume he is. Sally’s investigations force her into a disturbing world of complex mind games, murder, mystery, and age old secret societies. In a series of flashbacks into Alex’s past, the terrifying relationship between Alex and Nigel is exposed. Several more dead bodies rise to the surface, establishing even more multifarious dimensions to an already dense mystery. As the film progresses, the relationship between Sally and Alex intensifies, and the battle for superior intellect begins. It may well be very disconcerting seeing a teenager comfortably match the aptitude of an experienced professional, but it is also truly transfixing watching these two unlikely people battle for control of each others psyche.","Although essentially a spine-chilling thriller, this movie pushes every boundary and explores the terrifying possibility that someone, who you would have preferred never to have met, can effectively invade your upmost private thoughts and feelings; breaking into and analysing your very soul. This film delves into the closeness between two curious and highly potential young men, who we discover are ultimately bound by mythology, history and blood via a series of incredible twists and turns.","This is a visually beautiful and absolutely captivating film, with some of the most haunting and powerful acting to ever hit Australian screens. Both Alex and Nigel are such immensely complex characters; both radiating so much intelligence and darkness. They are very calculated in their actions and behaviours which help’s enhance the already creepy atmosphere, further unnerving the audience.","It is so fantastic to see that the production team has gone to such great lengths to ensure that the film is of the highest of quality in all departments. From the sinister looking cinematography to the gloomy musical score, this film has achieved absolute perfection in all areas. It is the kind of film that drags you in and doesn’t spit you out until the screen turns black and the end titles roll. And even then you are left exhausted in your seat, contemplating and processing all the intricate sights and sound you just were exposed to. It is one thing to keep someone on the edge of their seat for 110 minutes; it’s something entirely different to be able to keep someone wondering for weeks after.

It’s simply a matter of common courtesy not to walk out during a film, however, during the Melbourne Film Festival this year, I made the disastrous mistake of watching the Quay brother’s second feature length movie, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes. In retrospect, I should have ignored etiquette, and just have made a run for it. I would say it’s a “cinematic abomination”, but that would be an understatement. The fact that it won several prizes in the Locarno International Film Festival, makes me seriously wonder if all the judges were all high on marijuana, seeing as it’s still legal to grow in Switzerland. All I can say is, lucky them! The only possible way of making sense of this film would be to watch it under the influence of some kind of weird and wonderful mind altering substance. Don’t get me wrong, I’m normally strongly against all forms of illicit drugs, but this film is making me seriously reconsider their use as a tool to make sense of other people’s sick and twisted ideas and interpretations.","The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes is a dark and perverse fairytale about an evil yet charismatic Dr Droz who gatecrashes the wedding of Malvina and Adolfo, killing then abducting the stunning opera singing bride, whisking her off to his weird and spooky island villa, far, far away. Although it’s hard to find a definitive reason as to why he snatched this women in the first place (apart from the fact he’s completely stark raving mad), one can only assume he needs her, or at least her remarkable voice, for one of his bizarre experiments.","When they arrive on the bloodcurdling island, the powerful and mysterious doctor somehow revives the women and starts planning the staging of a catastrophic opera, in which Malvina will star. Although I could be completely wrong, one can only assume that Dr Droz is attempting to destroy the world as we know it. Never the less, his plan will only succeed with the help of Felisberto (who is confusingly played by the same actor as Adolfo), a piano tuner, who is employed not to repair pianos, much to his surprise, but instead to tune seven of the doctors bizarre automatons; large mechanical machines that play music and contain small disturbing figures that move repeatedly (such as a man who cuts his leg while chopping down a tree, and bleeds continuously into a pond), much like a cuckoo clock. Whilst stuck on this peculiar island, busily working under the watchful eye of the vile doctor, the young piano tuner begins to fall for the mystifying Malvina, and with the help of the housekeeper, devises a plan to rescue her.","Admittedly, although the film has a very unique and quite amazing visual style, that’s the only remotely positive thing I got out of it. It’s more of a self-indulgent dreary piece of art than something that audiences anywhere will be able to connect with. The story is confusing and almost non-existent; the characters, bland and soulless; the dialog unintelligible and irrelevant. The film is so deeply stylised, that there really is no possible way one can identify with it. This is an unsettling and surreal film that serves no real purpose, and is completely inaccessible to those who are sober. Take my advice, and run the other way."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"9 Square Metres for Two","p":["This is a great experimental documentary, made up of a series of short clips filmed by actual inmates of Baumettes Prison in France.

The filmmaker got a camera and filmed a group of old people as she asked some rather random questions. To me, I found this film to be a lazy attempt of a documentary. The photography was average, and the sound quality was pretty ordinary. Even though the characters in the film were very interesting people, it seemed as if they weren’t being fed the right questions to spark up exciting conversation.

Julia Stiles, Peter Coyote and the little boy who played Thor, were fantastic. Although they were really the “bad guys”, I felt for them. However, for one reason or another, I just didn’t seem to connect with the main character, played by Forest Whitaker. Maybe I just didn’t like his character? Maybe I just didn’t like the fact that he worked for an evil bean counting insurance company? I’m not sure. I did however like the tone and look of the film – very bleak, barren, isolated and dark. I’m not sure about whether I liked the story or not. It offered plenty of twists and turns, but at times seemed a little unrealistic. It has plenty of action and suspense, which keeps it exciting.

Offering a very uniquely Australian perspective into the massive sporting event, this film has some great interviews with all kinds of people involved in the event, from cyclists, to commentators, the public, celebrities, and even bus drivers. You are really taken on a journey with the four large larrikins, as they drink a lot of beer, and make full use of their press passes, interviewing everyone and anyone. Although this film is extremely entertaining, you almost feel embarrassed watching it, as the four are hardly the most appropriate Australian ambassadors (getting pissed all the time, and generally making a lot of noise). Never-the-less, it’s clear that they love the event and the lifestyle lived whilst the race takes place. They add a bit of extra, well lets be honest, actually quite a lot of extra life to the whole event. Technically, this film isn’t anything special with some really poor audio quality in places and some dodgy looking computer graphics. The musical score is also very amateur, although it suited the feel of the film. This film was much like a low-budget surfing movie. However, it makes you laugh, and at places almost makes you cry, and is a really enjoyable ride. Not really high class entertainment, but well worth a look."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Fantasma","p":["This is a really, really boring film that shows a group of people aimlessly walking around a theatre, and eventually watching a section of an equally boring film. But, despite the fact that the images on the screen put you to sleep, the soundtrack and music is truly amazing. The attention to detail is just incredible. You really just need to watch this film with your eyes closed, which admittedly, I did for most of the film. It really is some of the most sophisticated and complex uses of sound I’ve ever heard in a film. It reminded me much like the first Alien movie."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Friday or Another Day","p":["This is a fantastic film about an actor aboard a sailing ship that becomes shipwrecked on a deserted island. Phillippe de Nohan and the ships dog are the only survivors. However, they gather everything from the destroyed ship leaving him with plenty of provisions, supplies and a large collection of theatre bits and pieces. After a while, he starts to lose his grip with reality. But before he goes completely and utterly bonkers, he befriends a native islander he names Friday. This film explores the relationship between the man, the dog and the native. I love the main character in this film. You can certainly relate to him, which is a little bit scary. The dog in this film is also truly entertaining and plays just as big a role. As Phillippe starts to hone in on his primal instincts, at times the dog seems more civilised than the human. The soundtrack is fantastic, but what really makes this film special is the cinematography. The colours and look of the images are constantly changing. A lot of the scenes are quite surreal, others greyscale with hints of bold colours. It just looks amazing. I’m a huge fan of this film."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"from-gold-to-grapes-the-story-of-landsborough","l":"From Gold to Grapes: The Story of Landsborough","p":["This is a short film made up of local children’s drawings turned into animations and local adults voice over’s, that tell the tale of living in Landsborough.

When she returns, he is kicked out of his home as the couple fight for the terms of the children’s living arrangements. When an insane neighbour kills his daughter’s new pet, the man, who is hopelessly drunk at the time, unintentionally kills the neighbour in a fit of rage. Sent to jail, the film then explores the relationship between the now divorced husband and wife. Although I quite liked this movie, with its bleak locations, and convincing characters, its not easy viewing, as this poor mans life just falls apart in front of your eyes. You really feel for him as the director just continually picks him up and drops him. This film is very real, and very painful, but well worth watching. At the end though, you just feel sad and depressed."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Fumi and the Bad Luck Foot","p":["This is a great little animation about Fumi and her cursed foot.

It’s a film about someone who is stumbling and drifting into adulthood. She’s a slacker, keeps a notebook of self-improvement initiatives (such as “go to museum” and “learn chess”), and is struggling with love. This film looks ultra-low-budget, with long single grainy shots, poor sound quality and slow and natural dialog. It almost feels as if it’s more of an unscripted documentary than a drama. However, despite its film student look, the characters really start to grow on you and you become part of their world. Although nothing really exciting happens, you just go along for the ride (although it’s more like a scenic railway). It has some really funny moments, although it’s hardly a barrel of laughs – more just a look into someone’s life. I really loved this film and fell in love with the character of Marnie."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"funny-pets---black-holephotography","l":"Funny Pets - Black Hole/Photography","p":["These are funny little Japanese 3D computer animations about a cute girl and her two crazy pets.

He decides the only way to get out of debt is to make some more movies, and starts work on Pusher II and III. I guess the reason I loved this film so much is because I really admire people who attempt to make movies. It’s a constant uphill battle. I can personally relate to a lot of what Nicholas was going through, especially the writer’s block and cleaning up the house, only so you don’t have to think about the movie you’re supposed to be writing! Technically speaking, this movie was nothing special – it had very generic documentary qualities. However, the content was fantastic and truly interesting. It’s kind of sad, but human beings seem to get a kick out of watching other people hit rock bottom. I just loved the determination and nativity of the people in this film. For a person studying film and television – this is a great educational documentary to watch."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Guide Dog","p":["This is a really funny short animation about an enthusiastic but unqualified dog that answers an advertisement for a guide dog position, but finds the task slightly more challenging than he could ever imagine.

It’s about a very improbable friendship between a miserable film teacher, and an overly friendly and understanding door-to-door religious educator who saves his life, after the film teacher is locked in his own bathroom. It explores their relationship as they discuss and fight about religion, politics, war, family, faith, nationalism and film. I guess the reason I liked this film so much is because I could really relate to the film teacher, as he shared a lot of the same views as me. There were plenty of unsubtle anti-George Bush moments and anti-war conversations. But, I especially agreed when he fought with a movie theatre owner about allocated seating. I also agreed with most of what he said about religion and faith, although it was really great to hear the other side of the argument, from the religious educator. I also agreed with a lot of the views this man had, especially in regards to conscription laws. Overall, this was a really interesting film, with some funny moments, and a fascinating insight into South Korea. I’m a big fan."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"I Saw Ben Barka Get Killed","p":["I’ll start off by saying I wasn’t really a fan of this movie. I just couldn’t be bothered trying to keep up with it – I just found it boring. It’s basically a film about an ex-criminal who receives a strange commission from an illegal organisation to produce a documentary about decolonisation. I guess I just found this movie to be too old fashion, with its cool tone (verging on stagnant) and vintage soundtrack. I couldn’t relate or connect with the characters, nor did I care about any of them. I found the story too slow and it seemed to go off on random directions. I didn’t like the voice over narration either. Basically, I just didn’t like the movie at all."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"In Between Days","p":["This is a film about a Korean-born girl struggling through life with her mother in America – although, to be honest, I didn’t realise it was set in the US till after the movie! It explores the relationship between Aimie, and her only real friend, Tran. At first it seems Tran is looking to have a relationship with Aimie, but she’s not interested. But then it seems that Aimie has fallen in love with Tran, but he is more interested in another Korean girl. With no one to turn to, Aimie finds comfort in the memory of her father, whom she no longer has contact with. This is again, a really slow paced film, with an almost documentary feel to it. I didn’t really connect with the main characters, which meant I didn’t really care what happened to them. The photography and sound was very bland and boring, which suited the story. Overall, I found this movie a bit of a drag. I also hated the first scene, when Aimie gave Tran a “homemade” tattoo as I have a real phobia of needles."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"In The Pit","p":["This is a documentary that follows a colourful construction crew over two years as they work on Mexico City’s Periferico Freeway, in an effort to cope with the ever expanding traffic. It shows the struggles and daily travails of building a freeway without the machinery expected in modern day construction. It has some fantastic tales and viewpoints from some very unique and out of the ordinary workers. Although it offers a great insight into these peoples world, you have to be really awake and concentrating to appreciate this film. Unfortunately I watched it when I was tired, and almost fell asleep in a few places. Not because it was boring, quite the opposite! It’s truly fascinating hearing these people’s views and beliefs. But if you’re not in the right frame of mind, the film can easily wash over you, as it’s not overly action packed – although there are several moments of excitement. This film makes you laugh, makes you think and appreciate the little things in life. After watching this film, you’ll find it hard to abuse the so-called “lazy” road workers in the future! It has some fantastic helicopter shots, and some lovely time lapse photography. I think I really need to watch this film again to really appreciate all it has to offer. But my general opinion is: it’s a great film."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Last Men Standing","p":["This is a documentary about a community of a former mining town, which is dealing with poverty and illegal drug use. It’s a compelling, yet chilling portrait, but unfortunately, I found it kind of dull."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Last Train to Freo","p":["I really liked this movie. It still amazes me that people can come up with such fantastic scripts, which only feature one location and a couple of actors. This is a film about two dodgy looking ex-criminals that are travelling on the last night train to Fremantle; basically your stereotypical loud drinking train bogans. One of the men is a real big and scary man, although clearly smart but also with obvious anger management issues. The other is more of a side kick; young, less intelligent, immature, but quite funny. When an attractive woman gets aboard the train, both men are instantly captured. To an outsider, it would look like a couple of drop beats are harassing a young attractive woman, which is basically correct. At the next station, an older woman boards as well as a quiet geeky young man. As the trip to Fremantle continues, the power balance takes a much unexpected twist. This is one of the best Australian thrillers I’ve ever seen. The whole movie is just so tight and unpredictable. Although you know that the characters aren’t what they seem, you can never quite work out what their real story is. The best part is everything only becomes clear at the very last moment, so you’re pretty much at the edge of your seat the whole movie. I really loved everything about this film. The acting was superb. All the characters felt very, very real. The dialog was absolutely spot on. I really liked the classical music that played right through out the film. It added a nice subtle ambiance and helped set a great mood. It also helped reinforce the feeling of danger in some of the more dramatic scenes. The sound effects and Foley were great. Audio wise, the film felt very natural and authentic. This is a really entertaining film that keeps you guessing none stop. It also shows that you don’t need a lot of money to make a fantastic film. All you really need is a good idea."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Longing","p":["Markus lives in a small German village, with his adoring wife, working as a metal worker, and a part time fireman. After saving the life of someone who attempts to commit suicide, he goes on a weekend training session with the fire brigade. On the first night, he gets blind drunk and wakes up in bed with a waitress. Despite the fact that he still loves his wife, the relationship between Markus and the waitress grows and continues. This film explores Markus’ life, as he attempts to keep both relationships going. I found this film to be very slow and boring, and I guess because Markus was cheating on his wife, I didn’t really feel any respect for this character. The photography was very bland, and dreary, and the soundtrack was also very uninteresting and unexciting. It was another one of those typical “look inside someone’s life” kinds of films – but it was a life I would have preferred not to intrude into. As soon as this film started, I couldn’t wait for it to end."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"lost--found","l":"Lost & Found","p":["This is a strange collection of different stories, and funny sequences. It begins with a story of a wedding party that waits in suspense for the bride and groom.

Changing directions again, it then tells the story of two children who are born on the same day in the same city, but have no possibility of getting to know each other. As the film rolls on, more seemingly random stories are told. This is a really hard film to get your head around, as it just seems to be a collection of ideas thrown together. I can’t say I’m the biggest fan."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Love This Time","p":["Without being bias, as Rhys is one of my teachers at Uni, this is truly a fantastic short film. It tells the story of Nouria, as she deals with trying to keep a family together after the death of her mother. Her father won’t get out of bed, and she is left to look after her younger brother. The acting in this film is fantastic and extremely moving, despite the fact that all of the cast are young. Even the dog did a great job. The look of the film is beautiful, and portrays and paints a very accurate picture of outer city Melbourne suburbs. I especially loved the colour and tone of the film, with its grey/gold feel. It adds another layer of authenticity to the movie. The soundtrack was terrific, very clean and natural. This is one of the features missing from a lot of Australian shorts; no one seems to pay attention to sound. The music score was also very appropriate, and helped add to the overall mode of the film. It’s basically a film about love, as the film explores the relationship between Nouria, and her new boyfriend. I have only good things to say about this film, even the titles looked great."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"lovestruck-wrestlings-no1-fan","l":"Lovestruck: Wrestling’s No.1 Fan","p":["This is a fascinating documentary about Sue, a woman who has devoted her whole life and energy to professional wrestling. Her house is covered in wresting photos and memorabilia; she has hundreds of hours of wresting footage on tape, and has travelled to the USA on several occasions just to see wrestling. What makes this film so captivating is that Sue is genuinely a really unique and completely wrestling obsessed person! Wrestling is what she lives for. Spaning over ten years, this film gives a great insight into Sue’s world and her travels. But it also explores Sue’s personal life, which adds to the emotion of the film. The editing of this film is fantastic, mixing interviews, with video diaries, archive footage and plenty of wrestling shots. I’m really impressed that so many hours of film can be compressed into such a well rounded 52 minute film.

Having seen “Funny Ha Ha” just a few days before this one, I’m not sure I was ready to watch this one just yet. However, despite that, I still enjoyed it, although I did wish it would speed up. It’s basically a story about a young man who moves to a new town to pursue his music career as an indie rock musician. He spends a lot of time with one of his closest friends and his girlfriend, and grows more and more attracted to this woman. Like “Funny Ha Ha”, this film basically just shows everyday life, and everyday conversations, including the long pauses. It relies on honesty and simple humility to communicate its charms. Although I quite liked this film, as the characters grew on me more and more towards the end, I found “Funny Ha Ha” to be more entertaining as I really loved the girl in it. However, she does make an appearance in this film, playing much the same character. In fact, this is basically just a clone of “Funny Ha Ha”, telling a different story, and changing the main character from a female to a male. Well worth watching, just be aware that it’s slow and precise.

I’m fairly sure it was shot on 35mm, as the resolution was perfect. The audio quality was also really, really impressive. The musical score was also very nice. To top it all off, the screenplay was great. Spine-chilling, but great none the less! I really like the whole concept of the film. Obviously a lot of money has been put into this short, as all departments were producing results that easily matched the quality of high budget Hollywood movies.

As father and son separate, the film explores the two coming to turns with the past, of love and of what the future holds. As a viewer, I could quite easily connect with the characters and feel their pain and frustration. The look of the film was quite beautiful, with some lovely colourful scenes.

Set in Coober Pedy, a young girl called Kellyanne, spends all her time playing with her two make-believe friends Pobby and Dingan. She is completely adamant that these two people exist, which is driving her mother, father and older brother completely crazy. When Kellyanne’s Dad takes her two imaginary friends mining with him one night, he forgets to bring them home, which completely devastates the young girl. Kellyanne starts getting really sick, presumably due to the emotional stress caused by no longer having her two friends by her side. The family have no option but to search for the unseeable people, which indirectly, turns the whole town against them. But, all thanks to a brother’s love and devotion, things turn dramatically at the end, after a serious of very gripping circumstances. I felt that the acting in this film was really fantastic, especially as the two central characters were children. Although it was a very typical Australian film, I felt that the storyline was really strong, and it had a lot of unpredictable twists and turns. Visually, the film was stunning, with some great shots of a very mundane, yet matchless location. The soundtrack was perfect, and the musical score was really good. But the story is what made the film stand out from a crowd of other Aussie films. It had a really innocent feel to it. It was full of action and suspense; it made you laugh, and it was also very sad and moving at times. Overall, I was really impressed with this film. I know some people have complained that the young girl’s acting was poor, and she looked way to sick at the end of the film, but I doubt these people have had experience with unorthodox young children.

Jam packed with sword fighting, decapitations, disfigurations, lush landscapes, strong men, sexy women and fancy wirework, this film is a visual masterpiece. The soundtrack is complex and in-your-face, with some face-cringing skin-slicing moments. The music is grand, with some great orchestral sections. Although I didn’t really like the story line, as it was a bit to fantasy for me, that didn’t matter. There was no time to think about it.

It’s very, well, different, and very controversial. 19-year-old Katrina is stuck in boring suburbia, still living at home with her divorced father and for her toddler daughter, although her devoted stoner boyfriend looks after the child most of the time. When Katrina’s brother Danny is sent to jail for life, after committing one of the most stupid crimes I’ve ever seen, she is devastated and will do absolutely anything to get her brother out. She decides that she needs money for an appeal, but having never worked a day in her life, and knowing that her father’s not going to help her financially, she has to think outside the box. Her solution: she must kill her father as she’s first in line for the family inheritance. She’s too lazy to do it herself, so she will have to convince one of her many boyfriends to do the job for her, but luckily she’s never had any trouble getting men to do what she wants. This film takes sibling devotion and support to a totally new and disturbing level.","Starting out as a dark comedy, this film basically turns pitch black by the end. Katrina really is the devil. She has absolutely no redeeming features and no moral boundaries. She will literally do anything to get what she wants, and we can only just sit there are watch in amazement as she succeeds. This film is really like watching a train crash. You feel disgusted and revolted, yet you know there’s nothing you can do about it and simply can’t turn away. It really is a horrible film to watch, yet at the same time, exciting and hilarious. You just watch in disbelief as some really wrong stuff just happens on screen.","The acting in this film is fantastic. The woman who plays Katrina has done a truly amazing job. This is one scary character. She’s aggressive, arrogant, pushy, cocky, sexy, loud, cheeky, and basically, just pure evil. Emily Barclay plays her perfectly. She’s the whole reason the film works. The rest of the acting was done quite well, although you’re too busy trying to understand Katrina to pay to much attention to the others. They’re basically just your stereotypical boring suburban drifters. I did think Robert (the local copper) did do a great job though, and was very convincing in his role. Katrina’s father felt kind of shallow, but I think that helped the storyline and added to Katrina’s motivations. Katrina’s neighbour is a highlight, and delivers some of the funniest lines of the film.","Technically speaking, the film didn’t have the highest of production values. The footage was kind of bland and dull, and I really hated the computer graphics used in the opening sequence (the mail symbol flying through the air). Although the concept was quite good, visually, it just looked cheap and nasty. However, I did really like the title sequence, with the predictive text effect. It suited the whole suburban idea quite well, as mobile phone reliance is a fact of life in Katrina’s world. The sound was also pretty average, much like watching an episode of Neighbours or Home & Away. However, as the film is set in suburbia, the filmmakers could get away with saying it was intentional. The soundtrack/score was very appropriate (although I’m not the hugest fan of that style of music), and reminded me of the songs that blast out of the cars driving through suburban streets.","The structure of the film is very effective, shifting in time, through a series of real-time interviews, flashbacks and testimonies. By using this technique, the film has an added degree of energy and suspense. The story is told from many different perspectives, ranging from the local cop, small town gossip, friends, family, Katrina’s boyfriend and her many, many lovers. Although every one in the town is scared to death of Katrina, she’s basically a celebrity and everyone has a story to tell about her. In fact, it’s safe to say, most of the male population has probably slept with her. Overall, as I’ve said, this is a really disturbing film about a world of sex, crime, youth culture and, as the title suggests, suburban mayhem. It’s about a girl without a conscience in a world without morals. You basically have to strap yourself in, and go for the ride as Katrina hoons around her small town, doing donuts, sleeping around, and generally making everyone’s life a living hell. But at least there’s never a dull moment in Katrina’s life (although I’m sure she doesn’t feel that way)! This is a film about a family that gets destroyed, and a daughter who literally gets away with murder. She does so many appalling things, and yet by the end of the film, despite all the horrific events that have happened, things are looking good in Katrina’s world – it’s disgusting. You really feel bad watching a girl you can’t help to despise, achieving fame and fortune by doing all the wrong things. This is a seriously rude, dark and sexy film, that will make you laugh and will make you cringe. But one of the best aspects of the film, much like 2:37, is that when you leave the theatre, your head is full of unanswered questions. Why is Katrina the way she is? Why is she so driven and so unrepentant? Is it simply a matter of brother and sisterly love, or is something else going on? For the record, I think maybe the brother is the father of her child. But I guess I’ll never find out. Finally, this quote sums up the movie best: “I knew the grandmother, she was mad. I knew the mother, she was madder. It’s genetics I reckon, that’s the only thing I can come up with. You can’t get clean water from a dirty tank”. Despite all its faults – this is a film you much watch, even if you decide you hate it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Sud Express","p":["This is a slightly boring film about six ordinary people whose lives are affected by their journeys on the Sud Express. Although all the character were unique and quite interesting (a racist taxi driver, his unfaithful wife, two old men who didn’t walk to one another, a African migrant who tries to find a life elsewhere, another migrant who goes hunting for a lost lover, a guy in a wheelchair and his best friend), I think I’m just over stories that lack a beginning and an end. The highlight of this movie for me was the non-human actor in the film, a lovable dog that narrowly escapes death by owner. This wasn’t a beautiful film, nor was it exciting. It was basically a look into a city from the viewpoints of several interconnected characters. Nothing special."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Thank You for Smoking","p":["This film follows the life of tobacco industry lobbyist Nick Naylor, as he promotes and defends cigarette smoking in a time when the health hazards have become too plain to ignore. Nick, a master of manipulation, who has the skill and flair to convince anyone of anything, can talk his way out of any situation. Nick’s son Joey needs to understand and respect his fathers philosophy, and Nick works hard to respond to that need without compromising his lack of values. When a beautiful news reporter betrays Nick’s sexually-achieved trust, his world seems in danger of collapsing. But with the help of the MOD Squad (Merchants of Death – his equivalents in the firearms and alcohol industries), Nick takes on the big guns. This is a seriously funny film with truly amazing and side splitting dialog. Nick is such as loveable character despite the fact he’s working for an organisation that kills people to make a profit. It’s stylish, slick and fast paced, but best of all, every single line of dialog is perfection. I really loved this film."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Betel Tree","p":["This is a cute film about two people who reflect on their betel-chewing, teeth-lacquering and their displaced past while creating future memories for their grandchildren. Although it offered an interesting insight into another culture from my own, I found the story rather boring, although there were some funny moments (such as when one of the ladies was getting high of chewing betel)."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Book of Revelation","p":["I honestly believe this film has really changed me as a person. I’ve learnt a lot from it. Daniel, a talented male dancer is abducted by three hooded women, raped and tortured for twelve days, then dumped in the middle of no where with no clues to his attackers’ identity (other than one girl’s hair colour and some intimately located birthmarks and tattoos). Completely and utterly emotionally damaged, humiliated, and broken, Daniel tries to get his life back in to order, but struggles and eventually makes a huge mistake, in a very threatening and horrifying scene (although as a viewer, I can forgive him). This film is incredibly confronting, and has some horrendous rape scenes. The director wanted viewers to witness this kind of abuse with “fresh eyes” and as “human beings” instead of from either side of a gender divide. She has certainly achieved this. After watching “Last Train to Freo”, where the young lady onboard the train is in constant fear of violence and sexual abuse, this film really makes you think about the issue of sexual violence in a new light. The tables have turned. I’ve personally never seen a man getting raped by a woman, and after witnessing some of the scenes in this movie, they really got to me. I felt really sick and completely terrified. Actually, I still feel really terrified. But also numb. There have been plenty of movies with females getting raped by males. It really is something new to see it the other way around. I feel educated now. Scared shitless, but educated none-the-less. Any rape scene is horrible, and I really hate watching them. But theses scenes felt different emotionally. This is an amazingly powerful movie. But the unconventional context aside, the film is visually very beautiful and captures some great desolate tight urban locations in my home town, Melbourne. This film shows the city in a way that I’ve never looked at it before. The musical score and soundtrack is quite powerful, although I didn’t really appreciate it at the time, as the film had me sucked right in to its world.","This film explores a wide range of issues and themes, the most obvious being sex and power. I still can’t get over the sickening confronting and distressing rape scenes (I wonder if it had the same effect to female members of the audience?). What makes it even more overwhelming, is that Tom Long plays so many lovely nice characters in other films and television series that when watching this film, it’s almost like watching one of your close mates be violated and there’s nothing you can do about it. Any scene where a person is getting hurt normally bothers me a lot. I hate watching anything or anyone getting abused. I really hate needles, as I feel like it’s a violation of the human body. But this film really touched me, as much as some of the most horrific war and murder scenes in other movies. I really consider this film to be a brilliant masterpiece, if only become it affected me in such a major way. Step aside “The Isle” – you’ve been replaced."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Carnival of Animals","p":["A really strange and distinctive erotic fantasy of growing pains, imagined fetishes and ravished rabbits.

Visually it’s most impressive, despite the obvious low budget, with some fantastic night footage. I’m a big fan of the use of red light to highlight the freeways and party scenes. The soundtrack was great; I especially liked the sound used in the party scene, when the main character starts to drift off into another world. The music was really nice as well. I’m a big fan of the punchy acoustic steel string guitar sound. Overall, I was really impressed with the film."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Fence","p":["This is basically just twelve minutes of black and white grainy footage, of a group of boats catching giant tuna using a large net. It was more of an observational piece, but I just found it boring."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Host","p":["This may well be my favourite film so far! I have never seen such a fantastic audience reaction and participation, as I have with this film. It starts with an US Army officer, who orders the dumping of litres of nasty looking chemicals into the sink, which consequentially, runs out into the main river of Seoul, in South Korea. Somehow, the mixture of chemicals creates a mutant creature, which emerges six years later, and wreaks havoc in the city. The creature kills many people, and grabs a young girl, which it takes to its lair in the sewer tunnels. Her family, sure that she’s still alive, set out to bring her back home, while the US Army quarantine the river, claiming the creature is host to a horrific virus. This is a truly exciting and thrilling film, which is also extremely funny and very, very random. The special effects are fantastic, but what makes this film so special is that you seriously have no idea where the story is headed. What will start of as an emotional, and sad scene, will end up being a hilarious tongue-in-cheek fight sequence. One minute the monster is killing people, the next, some crazy doctor is drilling through the protagonists head! I have no idea what to make of this movie. I feel as if I missed a really important political or social message that was hidden behind the confusing, yet remarkable storyline. This film really has everything. It will make you jump out of your skin, it will make you cry, and for most of the film, it will make your cheeks hurt with laughter. This is a really unique film, that will, no question about it, become a cult classic. It’s a kind of a bit like a South Korean version of Shaun of the Dead, with a mutant monster instead of zombies. Very random – very funny! Like I said, it’s probably my favourite film so far of MIFF 2006."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"The Last Farm","p":["This is a quite powerful short film about an elderly man who has lost his wife, and is about to loose his farm, independence and his dignity. In desperation, he finds a way to keep it all. The look of this film is quite beautiful, set in a wonderful remote snow covered landscape by the ocean. But, although the main character does a fantastic job, and you really do feel his pain, his actions and the story in general is very predicable. However, it doesn’t really matter.

Starting with D.I.Y, Royston explores the music found in everyday life. The footage in this film was really bold and beautiful with some great panning/dolly shots. His film, Cut, is a hilarious attack at the Singaporean film censors in the form of a full blown singing and dancing musical. I really loved the humour of this film, and the big, loud and colourful performances. I didn’t really understand the story behind Monkeylove; however I really liked the look and sound of the film, with its grainy amateur-like images, and unnatural ear-piercing effects. Mother was a really narration driven story, with some great archive footage. Sons, like Mother, was again heavily narration driven, and explored the relationship between a father and son. New York Girl is a hilarious short film that shows an audition tape of a Chinese New York-born girl and her dream of becoming the next Wonder Women in an upcoming feature film. Although it’s just a girl, white backdrop and a camera, it really makes you laugh! Hock Hiop Leong, is an ode to an old café that has long since closed down, that starts off quite simple and documentary like, but latter breaks into full swing singing and dancing, almost Bollywood style! Careless Whisper is a love story, about a geeky man and his quest to get the attention and love of his dream women. Inspired by a dreadful singer that auditioned for the TV show Singapore Idol, this is a truly funny, yet painful film. Unfortunately, I can’t reminder what the last film, 24 hrs was about – but I’m sure it was good. Royston Tan is an amazingly diverse filmmaker that has a great attention to detail, and an obvious love of life. It would also seem he’s quite a fan of just randomly breaking into song and dance!

This film has some great special effects, some really funny moments and some moments that truly stun you. It has everything from talking squirrels, to talking bodiless Barbie dolls, to train disasters. The opening scenes scared the crap out of me, as I have a great fear of needles, but I really loved the dream sequences.

It’s a feature length documentary that is made up of home video footage captured by American television personality Rick Kirkham, over his lifetime. When he was fourteen he got a video camera, and basically has been filming his life ever since. He’s basically in love with being in front of the camera and captures everything (and I mean everything). This is a really self indulgent film, but at the same time, feels authentic and truthful. Rick’s life starts off full of excitement and success as he works as a national correspondent for the television show Inside Edition. But when his wife becomes pregnant and they get married, his life suddenly becomes far more complex. This film gives, what I can only presume is an accurate representation of Rick’s life. It shows his highs, and the moments when he hits absolute bottom. Rick’s life is truly a rollercoaster ride. One minute he’s on top of the world, the next, he’s fighting just to survive. Unfortunately drugs and depression play a huge part in Rick’s life, and it’s all caught on film. What’s so amazing about this film is that we really get an insight into this man’s life for better or for worse. We witness everything, from his fights with his wife, to his moving self confessions, to when the police take him away. Rick becomes completely and utterly obsessed with recording everything, which in the end contributes to his wife and children leaving him. This is not a happy film. It’s actually really depressing watching this man throw his life away. But it really does give you an amazing insight into the psyche of human beings. I don’t care what anyone thinks; I really got a lot out of this film. Sure the production values were crap, as it was shot on a dodgy handy cam. But the content was just so fascinating. Who ever edited this together did an amazing job. What would have been millions of hours of footage has been nicely compressed into a tight and effective story. This film also explores a generation obsessed with celebrity and technology. It will make you laugh, but more often than note, it will make you just think to yourself “why”! Human beings are so very complex and frustrating. This film proves it."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Twelve and Holding","p":["Rudy and Jacob are twin brothers who are best friends, yet totally different. Jacob is quiet, shy and has a nasty birthmark on his face (which obviously doesn’t help), whereas his striking brother is oozing with confidence and bravery. They are both friends with Malee, an intelligent and pretty only-child of a single mother, and Leonard, an overweight boy who lives in a household of food obsessed family members. When Rudy dies protecting his tree house, after a group of kids set it on fire (not knowing people were inside), Jacob, Malee and Leonard each deal with the tragedy in different ways. Malee, who believes she’s mature enough to deal with her own feelings, becomes totally obsessed and claims to fall in love with one of her mum’s patients (who is more than double her age). Leonard, who lost the ability to taste and smell due to the tree house fire, becomes passionate about losing weight, and forces his diet and exercise theories on his unimpressed family. Jacob, becomes fixated in making sure the boys who killed his brother, pay dearly for the pain they’ve put him and his family through. All of the young actors in this movie are truly amazing. You really feel their love and their pain. This movie offers some really sad moments, some really funny moments, and constantly makes you think about life and death. It’s a seriously powerful film, which is filmed beautifully. There was never a dull moment in the whole movie, and you are constantly fixated on the screen and the characters. I really like this movie."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"unfolding-florence-the-many-lives-of-florence-broadhurst","l":"Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst","p":["This is a unique documentary that gives a detailed insight into the life of an extremely colourful and gutsy Australian design innovator and artist, Florence Broadhurst. She was found murdered in her wallpaper design studio in 1977, a crime which is still unsolved. This film explores Florence’s life, leading up to this tragic event. Using a mixture of visually stunning real interviews, stylised drama re-enactments, wonderful computer graphics, Monty Python-style animation, incredible archival footage and interviews, this is a truly vibrant and intriguing film. As Florence eventually gained her local fame by designing wallpaper, this film makes use of this fact, and every shot has the same vivid, multi-coloured and flamboyant feel as her designs. It took me a while to work out whether this movie was fiction or fact (despite the fact it was label as a documentary), as the opening voiceover was that of someone who was apparently dead. But once I got my head around what I was actually watching, I slowly got hooked. Although Florence’s life was very interesting – she was such a powerful and determined women – it was the overall look of the film that I respected the most. The mixture of so many different styles and mediums was amazing. I really loved some of the animations in the film as they really made me laugh. Overall, it was a relatively slow paced film, that was a little hard to follow at first, but as the time paced and the story progressed, it developed into a stunning work of art.

It used a lot of video footage that was supposed to look like security camera footage. This gave the film a very cheap documentary feel to it. It also had a very school essay type feeling, as the two voice over’s spoke in a very unnatural book-like educated manner and tone.

I’ve spend so much money over the years on film-related books. I basically got a collection that rivals the ACMI bookshop! I’ve got everything from scripts, magazines, lighting books, production books, post production books, user manuals, audio books, movie books, acting books – pretty much something for every department. During MIFF, I’ve been reading some of my more recent purchases.","One I’m still in the process of reading is “Documentary: The Margins of Reality”, which is a book exploring the definition and understanding of the documentary form, as well as the relationship between documentary and drama. I’m finding this book really hard to read, because it’s written in a very academic and formal language. It reminds me too much like reading the stuff I need to read for the media studies class at Hawthorn. However, the content is very useful, and I will make myself get through it.","I also recently purchased the 3rd Edition of “The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook”. I’ve already got two of the original guerilla books by the same authors (Chris Jones and Genevieve Jolliffe), and loved them so much that I just had to buy this newest one. Yes, I guess you could say I’m obsessed with spending money on books. With 768 pages of jammed packed information, plus a CD with additional pages, this really is one of the most amazing books on low budget film making. Split into chapters such as training, concept, screenplay, finance, pre-production, production, post production, sales, etc. this book covers every aspect of making movies from conception through to completion, distribution and beyond. It’s full of easy to read, and in depth interviews with people actually working in the industry, and honestly answers most, if not all of the questions, you have. But the thing I love best about this book is that the authors are independent filmmakers who have actually made three movies; despite the huge obstacles they’ve had to work around (such as being thrown in jail). I have a great respect for these two people, as they’ve just gone out there and made movies, ignoring all consequences. Over MIFF I read this book from start to finish.","I also started reading “Friendly Enemies”, a book by Delia Salvi that explores director-actor relationships. Although I’ve only read the first couple of chapters, this is a really useful and easy-to-read book that will hopefully teach me more about dealing with actors when directing student films in the future. I also think it will assist with dealing with people when making my documentary.","I guess the reason I spend so much time and money on books such as the above is that I’ve come to realise that knowledge is power. You won’t learn half of everything you need to know about the filmmaking industry by just reading books, but the information you do learn will be invaluable and can only help to make you better at what you do."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"life-after-miff","l":"Life after MIFF…","p":["To be perfectly honest, I quite enjoyed complaining to people about having to attend MIFF. No sleep, no food, too many films, I would whinge. Although, I didn’t really care! It’s all part of the fun and adventure! I’m used to working in the entertainment industry, so my stomach is already minute, and I have the fantastic ability to be able to happily manage my sleeping pattern. So I’m basically the perfect candidate for attending MIFF. The look on peoples faces when you tell them you’ve just been watching film after film after film as part of your university course is priceless. What a great life I lead! While others at uni are reading pages and pages on highly complicated and technical mumbo-jumble, doings tests, exams, projects, and all other kinds of hard work, I’m just sitting back at staring at the big screen. But now that MIFF is over, I have to say I’m pretty depressed. I can now imagine why people who make films spend so long just going on the festival circuit. It’s such an amazing atmosphere! The amount of times I had to run from venue to venue (as I booked continuous sessions – no time to waste!), wide eyed and ears ringing, scoffing down a no-doubt week old 7/11 meat pie, only to realise that there are another four or five sophisticated looking people behind me doing exactly the same thing! It was great to see all these stylish people eating complete and utter crap, just so they could make it from film to film. MIFF brings together a whole lot of things that I’ve never experienced before in the one event. It’s pretty much a military campaign. You have to plan well in order to survive! I spend hours and hours reading up on all the movies and wanted to see, and spend a huge amount of time designing my non-stop timetable. Unfortunately, the three weekends in which MIFF runs over coincide with my brothers and two of my closest friend’s birthdays, so I had to count out weekends from my schedule. Never-the-less, I still fitted in a lot of movies. Some of them were crap, but, hey, that’s the price you pay! One of the best things about this festival was that as there are seventy or so of us first year film and television students, there was always someone in the theatre or in the lines that you knew and you could chat to about what you’ve seen and what you will see. I was kind of selfish and anti-social in planning my schedule, as I just decided what films I wanted to watch, didn’t allow for any social time, and didn’t really plan to meet up with anyone specific. But, it worked out great, because I still got to meet up with heaps of friends in the short time between films. I also had some really interesting conversations with random people in the MIFF queues, about various films. I made a special effort to see a wide range of films, from local to international, comedy to action, animation to documentary. I also decided to see most of the documentaries, to give me a better idea of what sort of film I would like to make this year. I’ve never seen such a hugely wide variety of different films! It was fantastic! I feel so more educated in cinema, now that I’ve successfully survived MIFF. What’s scary though is that after reading an article in “The Pundit”, a free independent guide to the festival, I realised that I had become, what the author described as a “MIFF Zombie”. I had become one of those people who had “taken it too far”. The only conversations I was having were about films. The festival guide became my bible. I was one of those people who could be found “leafing painstakingly through the festival guide, looking confused” as I tried to work out what day it was, and what I had planned to see next. I was one of those people who “shovelled in food absently and ignored dining companions as I pondered what to see”. I reached the “second stage of zombification”, as I sent out a mass e-mail listing what films I was going to see, and noted that if people wanted to see me, you’ll find me in the appropriate cinema. As the author put it, “The mass e-mail is terrifying proof that MIFF zombies have lost all interest in any social plans that don’t involve seeing films”. Admittedly, I even reached the final stages of “infection” towards the end of the festival, as I was “stripped of all social skills beyond primitive mutterings about genre, auteurism and mise en scene”. But you know what, it was worth it. I quite liked being a temporary, MIFF zombie. I felt like I was part of something special. I felt as if I belonged to a group of likeminded “film geeks”, who survived off the love of cinema, McDonalds and train station vending machines for a couple of weeks. But, despite the fact I loved it, there were some moments which were tough. Catching the last train out of Flinders Street every night, changing at Ringwood station, and then driving home everyday was a struggle. It’s always packed of tired people who just want to get home. Friday nights are the worst however, when all the drunken idiots are coming home from the footy. I hate public transport at the best of times, so that was a bit of a struggle. Another thing that was challenging was staying awake to write a bit about the films I saw each night. The last thing you want to do after watching films all day, and catching the last train home is sit in front of a computer and attempt to type relevant notes! But I’m so glad I had the self discipline to do it. Reading back over my notes is the only way I can remember the vast amounts of films I saw. Also, writing at the early hours of the morning, when I was desperate to go to bed, means that everything I typed was straight from my head, giving a very accurate and honest view of what I thought of the film. Overall, I’m so glad I came to university, if only because it forced me to attend MIFF. It was such a terrific experience, and I can’t wait to do it again next year!"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"reality-tv-has-no-redeeming-features","l":"Reality TV has no redeeming features…","p":["When inventor Paul Nipkow completed his “electric telescope” in 1884, he could not have predicted the impact it would later make on the world. Nipkow’s device, which allowed the sending of images over wires, inspired others to build upon this exciting new technology (Wikipedia 2006). In 1900, the term “television” was coined by Russian Constantin Perskyi. Thirty years later, the first television commercial was transmitted, and the British Broadcasting Commission began regular broadcasting (Bellis 2005). “Television” was now a recognized term. By 1948 over one million homes in the United States alone had television sets, allowing them to tune into shows such as Allen Funt’s Candid Camera, a show where ordinary people were caught on film during embarrassing staged pranks (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.3). The post-World War II Americans of the 1950s were content with this type of good humoured show. Funt suggested that its success was due to its presentation of “ people caught in the act of being themselves” (Balkin 2003). Even though participants might have been briefly embarrassed, their privacy and dignity were ultimately protected, plus no one was actually hurt (Balkin 2003). With the advent of network television, a new genre of programming had arrived: reality TV.","As society progressed, and television technology continued to develop, so did this fresh genre. The 1960s brought with it a rise in social revolution, human rights movements, civil rights movements, and anti-War movements (Wikipedia 2006). Although this decade affected all corners of the globe, in western societies particularly, more people started to protested, riot and reject their conformist lifestyle. By the time Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon, society was more sexually open and violent in their actions. Television had no option but to follow suit.","By the 1970s viewers, who were now accustomed to watching confronting Vietnam War footage as they sat around the dinner table, were finally ready for watching programs that displayed even more reality and further invasiveness (Balkin 2003). Non-profit station PBS responded in 1973 by broadcasting a weekly unscripted and unrehearsed show called An American Family which followed the real life travails of the Loud family (IMDb 2006). Reality TV was getting cruder, but it was not yet purely a money-making venture.","Eighteen years later, MTV’s The Real World had drifted further away from its predecessors, focussing on entertaining a younger audience with a cast specifically chosen to ignite conflict (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.3). During the early years of the 21st century, reality programs continued along this path. Viewers by the millions were tuning in to watch participants argue, fight, dine on rats and other grotesque creatures, lie to one another and reveal their most intimate personal details to a potentially worldwide audience. Reality television had transformed from a good humoured source of entertainment into a contest where participants competed against one another for love or money. Unlike those of the past, shows like Survivor, preyed on people who were willing to risk everything to win a sizeable cheque. Reality television had invaded the small screen. As president of CBS stated: “the world as we knew it is over” (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.4).","These new breeds of reality television programs share a common characteristic in that they exploit vulnerable social groups. Shows like that of Idol, Pop Stars and X-factor franchises have proven time and time again that people will do just about anything to be on television and claim their five minutes of fame. These programs target young and naïve people who are tempted by the remote possibility that they might end up strutting down red carpets amongst their favourite celebrities. The reality is that only a few people out of the thousands of participants will actually get to a point in the competition where anyone will start taking them seriously. It is also important to understand that reality television is a dangerous mix of reality and fantasy. Unlike fictionalised drama, where only characters get hurt, in reality television programs, real inexperienced teenagers can be emotionally damaged when, for example, Ian Dickson tells them that their voice “should come with a government health warning” (IMDb 2006). The ironic thing is that some of the worst performers, such as William Hung, sometimes end up with the most success because they are exploited and marketed for comedy value.","Big Brother is another example of networks exploiting vulnerable social groups, but instead of just focussing on young and naïve participants, they take advantage of those that do not have permanent fulltime employment and therefore have the ability to take several months off at a time. By offering a substantial sum of money to the winner of the competition, television networks lour in individuals who are struggling to pay the bills all at the cost of their self-respect and privacy. For most housemates, Big Brother is just another “get rich quick” scheme.","Even shows such as Survivor take advantage of a specific type of individual, although not one that you would usually associate with being exploitable. Unlike those that feature in Big Brother or Idol, these candidates do not necessarily have to be youthful, but instead must have the drive to do whatever it takes to win the competition. Survivor targets those who are experienced, ruthless and competitive. Where Idol has students and musicians, Big Brother tradesman and fish & chip shop employees, Survivor has lawyers and ex-Navy seal operatives. This variety of show also has a genuine element of risk. Despite the fantasy situations, participants, who are real people, can get physically harmed as they perform various stunts. During production, the stakes are heightened even further when viewers grow bored of the show and the producers are forced to increase the danger in an attempt to increase viewers, and with them, advertising revenue.","Jerry Springer is another obvious example of producers taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of people, specifically, unstable working class types with serious personal and relationship issues that can’t afford to get assistance through counselling or other expensive means. Audience’s world-wide tune into this program, and laugh at these peoples expense; much like the freak shows of yesteryear. Funniest Home Videos is just as immoral as it catches parents shamelessly exploiting their injured children and costumed pets for the chance of winning a hefty cash price (Rowen 2000).","The harsh truth is that, like every business, reality television programs exist purely to make money. In the late 1980s television networks found themselves in financial troubles as they started failing to raise enough money to survive. This, and the other factors, such a labour instability, forced the television industry to re-evaluate their programming tactics (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.7). It did not take long for networks to realise that reality television was the ideal solution. Because reality television shows are unscripted, networks would no longer have to be dependent on hiring unionised writers and actors (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.7). Where it can take as much as four million dollars Australian to produce a sitcom or drama, an episode for a reality television program will generally cost around a third of that price (Balkin 2003). Because of this, many public television stations, particularly in Europe embraced reality programming. It had been transformed from a form of entertainment into a financial survival mechanism (Murray & Ouellette 2004, p.7).","One of the key differences between reality television of the past, and that of the likes of Big Brother and Idol is that by utilising new technology such as SMS and The Internet, viewers can interact with the show, voting people they like to “play on” and evict those they do not. At first this may seem like a logical step to expanding upon television as an entertainment and information medium, but once profits gained are taken into consideration, it becomes clear that it is just another method for the networks to make money. There are sponsorship deals for the naming rights to bigbrother web site domains. These websites are covered in advertising banners. In Australia, by placing the Big Brother house in the theme park Dreamworld, all parties benefit as each can promote the others respective businesses and products. It is also worth noting that Dreamworld is owned by the Macquarie Leisure Trust, which also owns and operates AMF bowling, a sponsor of the Australian show. These are all examples confirming that television stations have chosen profit over entertainment value. Instead of allocating funds to developing new dramas or sitcoms, they are exploiting specific demographics so they can output content at the minimum of costs.","It is not only new technology that has helped networks satisfy advertisers. Producers also have taken advantage of more traditional advertising means to increase their cash flow. Big Brother is again a most appropriate example. All the items inserted into the house have been placed there through sponsorship deals. In Australia, all of the food products within the house come from specific food companies that have commercial agreements with the show’s production company. Any food products that are not covered by a contract have their labels removed (Wikipedia 2006). The Australian Big Brother has affiliations and sponsorship agreements with paint suppliers, alcohol brewers, car manufactures, building supplies, home automation fitters, fitness organisations and even carpet companies. More obvious forms of traditional advertising can be found during eviction shows, where walls are covered in signs and banners much like that of football ovals.","When shows such as An American Family were being aired in the 1970s, reality television was just another harmless form of entertainment. But as society progressed, and “making a profit” became more important, programs like MTV’s Cops emerged to keep networks afloat. By the new millennium reality television no longer had any redeeming features; it was all about making a profit. Television networks started to exploit a wide variety of social groups to help achieve this aim. They started to use new technology to increase their cash flow. Product placement techniques started to become common place, keeping advertisers happy. Reality television demonstrates that civilisation has put ethics and morals aside, so that corporations can make money. It will be interesting to see what networks will do next when people become bored of the current reality television format, forcing producers to formulate new ways of keeping advertisers satisfied."]},{"i":"bibliographyreference","l":"Bibliography/Reference","p":["Balkin, K 2003, Reality TV: introduction, Greenhaven Press, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.enotes.com/reality-tv-article/39483","Bellis, M 2005, History of television timeline, About, viewed 22 May 2006, http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_television_timeline.htm","Big Brother Suppliers 2006, Endemol Southern Star, viewed 22 May 2006, http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/bigbrother/suppliers.asp","Cline, A 2005, Ethics and reality TV, About, viewed 22 May 2006, http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/phil/blphil_eth_realitytv.htm","Friedman, J 2002, Reality squared: televisual discourse on the real, Rutgers University Press, New Jersey.","Grindstaff, L 2002, The money shot: trash, class and the making of TV talk shows, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.","Hendershot, H 2005, The boob tube, Flow, viewed 22 May 2006, http://jot.communication.utexas.edu/flow/?jot=viewid=513","Internet Movie Database Incorporated, An American family, Amazon, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211195/","Internet Movie Database Incorporated, Candid Camera, Amazon, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045376/","Internet Movie Database Incorporated, Memorable Quotes from “Australian Idol”, Amazon, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382400/quotes","Internet Movie Database Incorporated, The real world, Amazon, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103520/","Murray, S & Ouellette L 2004, Reality TV: remaking television culture, University Press, New York.","Reality TV history summary 2005, BookRags, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.bookrags.com/history/popculture/reality-tv-bbbb-05/","Roscoe, J 2002, Interview with Peter Abbott, Carfax Publishing, Australia.","Rowen, B 2000, History of Reality TV, infoplease, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.infoplease.com/spot/realitytv1/","Wikipedia contributors 2006, 1960s, Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1960soldid=54505672","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Big Brother (Australian TV series), Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_%28Australian_TV_series%29oldid=54496067","Wikipedia contributors 2006, History of television, Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_televisionoldid=53947080","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Jerry Springer, Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerry_Springeroldid=54143409","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Paul Gottlieb Nipkow, Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Gottlieb_Nipkowoldid=52700591","Wikipedia contributors 2006, Reality television, Wikipedia, viewed 22 May 2006, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reality_televisionoldid=53948497","William Hung 2006, Intermix Network, viewed 22 May 2006, http://www.williamhung.net/"]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Alien","p":["You can tell a lot about a film by its opening titles. The first minutes of Alien gives a very accurate forecast of what you’re in for: dark, spine chilling and ominous. As seemingly random lines appear on the screen, building up to reveal the title of the movie, you can also predict it’s going to be slow and precise. The star-dotted background gives you the distinct sense of the isolation and vulnerability that comes with intergalactic travel. This and the addition of the soft and eerie soundtrack get your heart rate pumping.","Alien is like watching a NASA launch, yet knowing that it’s all going to end in disaster. The pacing is so slow, and the working class characters appear so realistic, it’s unnerving. There’s a strong sense of hierarchy, with the boys vs. Ripley and the cockpit crew vs. the engineers.","Unlike a lot of horror flicks, this movie doesn’t rely on scaring its audience with fancy special effects. In fact, it almost feels as if the few special effects driven scenes were deliberately made inadequately, as if to hint at their insignificance.","What keeps you in suspense is that you cannot predict who the next victim will be and when they’re going to die. The ghostly sound effects, constant heart-beat-like pulses, hazy desolate environments and epileptic-fit-inducing strobing lights add to the immense impression of danger. The Nostromo is a flying hunk of junk, yet considering its vastness, the narrow and gloomy engine-room-like hallways are extremely claustrophobic. What’s most chilling though is that you’re not always shown everything – leaving your imagination to run wild.","The Alien itself seems like a soulless machine designed to inflict the maximum physical and emotional pain on its prey. When it takes down Lambert, its slow movements and her horrific cries for help makes you fear that this is more of a raping than a killing. The fact that it waited until Ripley was in her underwear before striking, makes you wonder if it was ‘programmed’ to hold off until she was at her most vulnerable. In contrast, Ash seems more ‘alive’, showing signs of human emotion and sexual frustration as he attempts to kill Ripley.","It took seven years before James Cameron’s sequel was released, and yet, even with a heavily increased budget and an updated arsenal of special effects technology, it didn’t even come close to matching the sheer terror of the original. Alien is an impossible movie to fault, as it seems to have been engineered to perfect precision."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"realism--representation","l":"Realism & Representation","p":["As you know, every time we come across a media text, we’re not seeing reality, but instead someone’s interpretation of it. The media take something that’s real, manipulated its form to suit a specific purpose, and we end up something very different to the original. This is the process is of mediation(Northallerton College).","An example of this is television show, The Glass House. The punters sitting in the studio audience will see something very different to what ends up eventually getting aired. The seemingly spur-of-the-moment jokes will have been practised repeatedly; the crowd will have been warmed up and trained on how to laugh plus additional audio and computer graphic will have been added in post production. The whole experience of hearing a few John Howard jokes will have been mediated extensively (Northallerton College).","This type of consideration is relevant whether analysing a newspaper or TV news program (and you think to yourself “how true is it?”), criticising a film or television drama (“how lifelike is it?”) or even when evaluating advertisements (“can that stainless steel knife really cut a shoe in half?”) (Dover).","If you look at the definition of the word “media” – which is defined as a medium for carrying or communicating information (Wikipedia 2006) – Chinese whispers, or the telling of a joke springs to my mind. One joke can be told a million different ways by a million different people. More relevantly: one news story can be conveyed very differently by different TV crews or newspaper reporters.","Something worth thinking about though is whether or not it’s even worth raising the issue of ‘realism’ these days? I mean, doesn’t everyone already understand that the reality presented by the media isn’t really real? Isn’t it just a method of intellectualising about forms of fashionable entertainment which weren’t really meant to be read into so deeply or taken so seriously (Dover)? A story of a man getting hit in the groin with a football may have been just a funny narrative in the authors mind, and yet a media studies student will be able to tear the story to shreds and write pages and pages of complex analytical garbage.","That said, it’s probably better to be aware of the prevalence, influence and social effects of the content that’s being (or not being) presented to us as a “real” and “true” (Dover). That way we can develop an understanding of not only how the media operates but also why they operate, retaining a sense of “critical distance” (Dover). Was the film I, Robot made simply to entertain kids or rather to sell more Audi cars, Converse shoes, JVC CD Players and increase FedEx’s clientele? Sociological, political, cultural and ideological influences all determine the way in which the media presents reality to us, as do other influences such as financial and economic factors as shown in the previous example (Dover).","There was a point in the past though, when the term ‘ realism‘ was considered outdated and the significance of realist approaches less relevant (Branston & Stafford 2003). Some theories suggested that there is no ‘real’ to represent and that realism is, in effect, just an illusion (Osborne 2001). But now days, with reality TV invading primetime and the insistence of trying to create exact replicas of the past (such as Jackson recreating New York in King Kong), questions of realism have returned with revenge (Branston & Stafford 2003).","With realism back in the limelight, we can once again start to put it under the magnifying glass. One of the main problems concerning realism is the idea that any representation is a selection, and therefore elements have been specifically selected or ignored for inclusion and arranged in whatever manner the creator so desires. For example, in the build up to the 2001 Federal Election the Australian government told the public that a group of Iraqi asylum seekers threw their children overboard, backing their claims with photographs to help fuel the government’s campaign to demonise asylum seekers trying to reach the country. It was later revealed that the public weren’t shown the bigger picture – the refugee’s boat was sinking and no one was in fact thrown in – they jumped.","But even if we were able to include every single itty-bitty detail and possess a completely objective perspective, we cannot convey reality in words because words are just signs – arbitrary signifiers that have no logical relationship to what they symbolize, and therefore cannot clearly and objectively represent reality (Lye 1997). Even the word ‘reality’ has its problems – it’s far too comprehensive and encompasses way too much to be of any real use as well as restricting our very sense of what ‘reality’ actually is (Lye 1997)."]},{"i":"bibliographyreferences","l":"Bibliography/References","p":["Osborne, R 2001, Megawords, Allen & Unmin, Crows Nest.","Branston, G & Stafford, R 2003, The Media Student’s Book, Routledge, New York.","Plato, The Republic, Penguin, Harmondsworth, Middlesex.","Pope, V 2002, Representation and Realism, viewed 25 March 2006, http://www.litnotes.co.uk/realism.htm.","Representation, Northallerton College, viewed 25 March 2006, http://www.northallertoncoll.org.uk/media/representation.htm.","Lye, J 1997, Some Notes on Realism, Brock University, viewed 25 March 2006, http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/realism/.","Dover, R, The News: Realism, Narrative and Form, viewed 25 March 2006, http://www.newi.ac.uk/RDOVER/MED-STUD/the_new2.htm.","Dover, R, Realism and the Contexts of the Media, viewed 25 March 2006, http://www.newi.ac.uk/RDOVER/MED-STUD/realism_.htm.","‘Media’ 2006, Wikipedia, viewed 25 March 2006."]},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"l":"Contribute","p":["FCP Cafe is entirely open source and hosted on GitHub& CloudFlare Pages.","GitHub is a safe and secure developers platform used by over 73 million users worldwide.","FCP Cafe uses CloudFlare for DNS and hosting, and VentraIP for domain registration.","You can make changes to the site by submitting pull requests on GitHub.","We welcome and encourage users submitting their own case studies, articles, products and news items.","You can see all the current contributors.
