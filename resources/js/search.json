Here are a few ways you can do this:","Library Backups: Final Cut Pro automatically creates backups of your libraries. These backups are stored in a folder named Final Cut Backups in your Movies folder. You can adjust how often these backups are made using CommandPost.","Duplicate Libraries: To manually back up your work, you can duplicate your library in Finder.","External Drive: You can also manually copy the library to an external hard drive or another secure location. Simply drag the library file in Finder to your backup location.","Time Machine: If you're using Apple's Time Machine backup system, make sure that your Final Cut Pro library is in a location that Time Machine backs up. Time Machine backs up your entire computer at regular intervals, so this provides a kind of automatic backup.","Cloud Storage: You can also use a cloud storage service like iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox for backups. Note that video files can be quite large, and you'll need enough storage space in your cloud service to accommodate them.","Remember to keep your backup drives or locations secure and check them regularly to make sure the backups are being performed correctly.","Before you perform any major edits or changes to a project, it's a good idea to create a backup. That way, if something goes wrong, you can go back to the backup version.","Also, keep in mind that Final Cut Pro libraries might only contain references to your media files if you're keeping your media external to the library, so it's important to also back up your media files."]},{"i":"how-can-i-export-a-project-in-final-cut-pro","l":"How can I export a project in Final Cut Pro?","p":["You can learn more here."]},{"i":"how-can-i-improve-my-editing-speed-in-final-cut-pro","l":"How can I improve my editing speed in Final Cut Pro?","p":["Improving your editing speed in Final Cut Pro can be accomplished with a combination of technical skills, keyboard shortcuts, and optimizing your workflow. Here are some tips:","Learn Keyboard Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts can save a significant amount of time in the editing process. Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used ones, like \"i\" for setting an in-point, \"o\" for an out-point, and \"space\" for play/pause.","Use Proxy Media: When dealing with high-resolution video like 4K or 8K, editing can become sluggish. Use Final Cut Pro's proxy media feature, which allows you to create lower-resolution versions of your footage for smoother editing. When you're done, you can switch back to the full-resolution media for final output.","Organize Your Media: Keep your footage and assets well-organized. Use libraries, events, and keywords to categorize and manage your footage. This will make finding and accessing the clips you need much faster.","Use Presets: If you find yourself often applying the same settings or effects, save them as presets. This can be done for color grading, audio effects, and more.","Optimize Your Hardware: Make sure your computer is up to the task. Keep your software up to date, ensure you have enough free storage space, and consider upgrades to your RAM or GPU if necessary.","Batch Operations: Perform tasks such as transcoding, rendering, and exporting in batches, ideally during downtime, to avoid interrupting your editing flow.","Learn to Use the Magnetic Timeline: The magnetic timeline is one of Final Cut Pro's unique features. It helps maintain synchronization when moving clips around, which can save you time rearranging your timeline.","Color Coding: Use color coding for your clips and timelines. This can help you quickly locate related material or sequences.","Use the Skimming Feature: The skimming feature allows you to quickly review your footage and makes cutting and trimming faster.","Storyboard Your Videos: Before even starting with Final Cut Pro, have a clear idea of what you want to achieve. A storyboard or script can reduce the time spent experimenting with different edits.","Remember that like any skill, speed comes with practice. The more you use Final Cut Pro and become familiar with its features, the faster you will get."]},{"i":"how-can-i-share-my-final-cut-pro-project-with-others-for-collaboration","l":"How can I share my Final Cut Pro project with others for collaboration?","p":["If you're looking for the best collaboration workflow, check out PostLab."]},{"i":"how-can-i-stabilize-shaky-footage-in-final-cut-pro","l":"How can I stabilize shaky footage in Final Cut Pro?","p":["You can learn more here."]},{"i":"how-do-i-add-subtitles-or-captions-in-final-cut-pro","l":"How do I add subtitles or captions in Final Cut Pro?","p":["You can learn more here."]},{"i":"how-do-i-create-and-manage-libraries-in-final-cut-pro","l":"How do I create and manage libraries in Final Cut Pro?","p":["Creating and managing libraries in Final Cut Pro is a fundamental part of organizing your editing projects.

To do this, select the event, then go to File > Import > Media (or use the keyboard shortcut Command-I).","Moving and Copying Events: To move or copy events between libraries, you can simply drag and drop them in the library browser.","Renaming Libraries and Events: To rename a library or event, click on its name in the library browser, then enter the new name.","Deleting Libraries and Events: To delete a library, first make sure it's closed (select it, then go to File > Close Library). Then you can delete it in Finder, like any other file. To delete an event, select it, then press the Delete key.","Backing Up Libraries: To back up a library, you can simply copy it in Finder to another location, like an external hard drive. You can also use the built-in library backup feature, which automatically saves backups to your Movies folder.","Remember that managing libraries effectively can help you keep your projects organized, and make it easier to find and work with your media files.

This could be a deciding factor if you're not using Apple hardware.","Pricing Model: Final Cut Pro offers a one-time purchase, which can be more affordable in the long run. On the other hand, Adobe Premiere Pro follows a subscription model that can be more flexible and also includes updates as long as the subscription is active, but tends to be more expensive over time.","Performance: Final Cut Pro is known for its performance optimization for Apple hardware, which can make it run more smoothly on Macs. Adobe Premiere Pro can also deliver good performance but may not be as optimized for specific hardware.","Interface and Workflow: Final Cut Pro uses a Magnetic Timeline, which offers a different editing experience by automatically moving clips to avoid gaps and collisions. Premiere Pro uses a more traditional track-based timeline, which can be more intuitive to those coming from other editing software. This aspect largely comes down to personal preference.","Integration with Other Software: Premiere Pro is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, so it integrates very well with other Adobe products like After Effects and Photoshop. Final Cut Pro also has some level of integration with other Apple software like Motion and Compressor, but the Adobe ecosystem is generally more extensive.","Learning Curve: Both programs have a steep learning curve due to their advanced capabilities, but some users find Final Cut Pro to be more user-friendly initially.","Support for Formats and Codecs: Both support a wide range of video formats and codecs, but there may be differences in support for specific formats. For example, you'll need to use a third party solution called BRAW Toolbox to use BRAW files in Final Cut Pro.","Collaboration Features: Adobe Premiere Pro has a feature called \"Team Projects\" for cloud-based collaboration between editors. You'll need to use a third party solution like PostLab to easily collaborate in Final Cut Pro.","It's important to note that both are professional-grade tools capable of high-level editing and post-production work. The choice between them often comes down to personal preference, specific project requirements, and the hardware/software ecosystem you're already working in.

This could be as simple as a cross dissolve, or something more complex like a 3D cube spin or page peel.","Keyframe Animations: You can animate virtually any visual aspect of a video clip or effect using keyframes. Keyframes allow you to set specific values for certain parameters (like position, scale, or opacity) at specific points in time. Final Cut Pro then animates the change in these parameters over time.","Effects and Filters: Final Cut Pro includes a variety of effects and filters that can be animated, like blurs, color changes, distortions, and more.","Motion Paths: You can animate objects to move along a specific path over time.","3D Animations: Although FCP doesn't include full 3D modeling tools, it does allow you to create some 3D animations. For example, you can animate 2D images or text in 3D space.","Animations with Motion: If you need more advanced animation capabilities, you can use Apple's Motion software, which integrates seamlessly with Final Cut Pro. Motion allows for more complex animations, including particle systems, replicators, and much more.","Remember, while FCP offers a lot of animation capabilities, it's primarily a video editing tool. If you're looking to create more complex animations or motion graphics, you might want to consider using a tool that's specifically designed for animation, like Adobe After Effects or Apple's Motion."]},{"i":"what-kind-of-effects-can-i-add-using-final-cut-pro","l":"What kind of effects can I add using Final Cut Pro?","p":["Final Cut Pro comes with a variety of built-in effects that you can apply to your video clips. These include:","Video Effects: There's a broad range of video effects available in Final Cut Pro, including color corrections, distortions, blurs, stylistic effects, and more. Some popular ones include \"Vintage\" effects for a retro look, \"Keying\" effects for green screen work, and \"Light\" effects for flares and glows.","Audio Effects: Final Cut Pro also includes a variety of audio effects. These include EQ filters, noise reduction tools, reverbs, echoes, and more.","Transitions: Transitions are a type of effect that you can place between clips. Final Cut Pro includes various transition effects such as dissolves, wipes, slides, and more complex 3D transitions.","Text and Generators: Final Cut Pro includes several types of text effects and motion graphics generators. These include title effects, credits, lower thirds, backgrounds, and more.","Keying and Compositing: Final Cut Pro includes powerful tools for keying and compositing, which are used to remove backgrounds (such as with green screen footage) or combine multiple layers of video.","Speed and Time effects: With these effects, you can slow down or speed up your clips, create freeze frames, and even reverse your footage.","Color Grading: Final Cut Pro has advanced color grading tools, including color wheels, color curves, hue/saturation curves, and custom LUTs.","Stabilization and Correction: These effects help fix issues with your footage, such as shaky camera work or lens distortion.","360° Video Effects: If you're working with 360° video, Final Cut Pro has several effects specifically designed for this format.","Remember that you can further expand FCP's capabilities with third-party plugins. These can provide additional effects, transitions, and other capabilities. As with any effect, it's important to use these tools judiciously; while they can enhance your project, overuse can be distracting to the viewer."]},{"i":"where-can-i-find-good-tutorials-or-courses-for-learning-final-cut-pro","l":"Where can I find good tutorials or courses for learning Final Cut Pro?","p":["You can find lots of great resources on our Training page.","Want to contribute?

They have worked very hard for over a decade on making Final Cut Pro better and better. This open letter is aimed at the executives who set the priorities of the Final Cut Pro development team and the Apple managers whose policies limit the public marketing of Final Cut Pro to a couple of website updates a year and some mentions in Apple keynotes about how much faster Apple hardware is getting.","The letter’s signatories aim was to encourage Apple to make a new commitment to the professional TV and filmmaking industry. They believe that would potentially benefit filmmakers the world over regardless of their personal NLE preferences.","Competition is a positive. Apple has demonstrated a willingness to swing big. The very fact that they are not exclusively tethered to our industry allows them to try things others likely can’t. We hope you’ll support us in encouraging one of the heaviest hitters in media and technology to more forcefully push the boundaries of all of our tools.","They gathered some comments about Final Cut Pro and Apple:","Galliano Olivier, editor of ‘Marianne,’ a French TV drama series edited in Final Cut and distributed by Netflix says “In France, it is extremely difficult to get permission to edit TV with Final Cut Pro. You can’t use it without fighting producers, directors, post-production supervisors, sound editors, etc...”","Knut Hake BFS, editor of ‘Blood Red Sky,’ a feature film distributed by Netflix and edited using Final Cut Pro commented, “I think it would make a big difference for workflow consultants, systems integrators and third-party developers if there was a public Beta program for Final Cut Pro. Apple already do it for iOS, macOS and even Safari. It would make Final Cut more reliable and make it much easier for people to fit Final Cut into their plans for the future.”","Steven Sanders, editor in chief of of the Fox TV series ‘War of the Worlds’ season 3 said “The two main reasons why I am often not allowed to chose my favourite editing application, which is Final Cut Pro are: 1. Collaboration! Editing big productions needs collaboration. Different users have to be able to access the same library at the same time. There is no way around this. Avid Media Composer does it and even DaVinci Resolve does it. Apple still targets the single user. They have to change that. That will change everything. 2. Many professionals do not know how Final Cut works. They are afraid of it, even regard is as ‘iMovie Pro.’ I hear that all the time in my business. This perception really has to change.\"","Vanessa E. Brogna, assistant editor of ‘Bridgerton’ one of the top TV shows on Netflix commented: “Final Cut Pro is my favorite NLE. It's an absolute powerhouse and I feel the most creative and productive. Doing one step in Final Cut is about 3-4 in other NLEs. However, the real magic of Final Cut is its free form style of editing. Editing on a magnetic timeline is streamlined and smooth so I can still be organized, but I'm able to spend more time experimenting in the edit creatively and finesse my work.“","Jeff Asher, editor of ‘Big Sky,’ a US TV series on ABC and Hulu, says “As a TV editor, my job consists of being creative and being fast. Final Cut is the best NLE to achieve both of those goals. Now we need Apple on board with a roadmap and open dialogue with Film and TV creators to restore confidence lost over ten years ago.”"]},{"l":"Press"},{"l":"Before","p":["An open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro, signed by editors and post-production pros around the world (ProVideo Coalition)"]},{"i":"after","l":"After:","p":["Apple responds to the open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro (ProVideo Coalition)","Apple responds to open letter about improving usage and reputation of Final Cut Pro in filmmaking industry (9to5mac)","Apple Response to “Final Cut Pro in TV and Film” Open Letter (fcp.co)","Apple Responds to Open Letter Demanding Improvement of Final Cut Pro (PetaPixel)"]},{"i":"open-letter-19th-april-2022","l":"Open Letter (19th April 2022)","p":["Abbas Fahdel, Director of ‘Homeland: Iraq Year Zero,’ Feature Documentary, Iraq","Andrea Chignoli, Editor of ‘\"No\" directed by Pablo Larrain,’ Feature Film, Chile","Andreas Menn, Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany+Swiss","Andrew McKee BFE, Editor of ‘Eaten by Lions,’ Feature Film, UK","Azusa Yamazaki, Editor of ‘Drive My Car,’ Feature Film, Japan","Benjamin Ikes, Editor of ‘Buba,’ Feature Film, Germany","Benjamin Mercer F.C.E, Editor of ‘Unknown Soldier / Tuntematon Sotilas,’ Feature Film, Finland","Beverly Maguire BFE, Editor of ‘It’s Pony,’ Animated TV series, UK","Bo Li, Editor of ‘Plastic China,’ Feature Documentary, China","Brad Stoddard, Finish Editor / Colorist of ‘Sakura & Pearls: Healing From World War II ,’ Feature Documentary, US","Brett Ramsey, Editor of ‘In Pit Lane ,’ TV News, Australia","Brian Zwiener, Assistant Editor of ‘Terminator: Dark Fate,’ Feature Film, US","Carsten Behrendt, Editor of ‘Helden der Hauptstadt,’ Feature Documentary, Germany","Chad Tremblay, Editor of ‘Hunter Hunter,’ Feature Film, Canada","Chankanet Leksomboon, First Assistant Editor of ‘Bangkok Breaking,’ TV Drama Series, Thailand","Chris Black, Editor of ‘Fly the flag for Human Rights',’ TV Documentary Series, UK","Chris Hocking, Editor of ‘Neighbours: Erinsborough High,’ TV Limited Series/Mini Series, Australia","Christopher Darlington, Editor of ‘The Uncluttered Worlds of Christopher Pratt,’ Feature Documentary, Canada","Clark N Henderson, Assistant Editor of ‘Paramedics: Emergency Response,’ TV Factual Series, Canada","Cris Mertens, Editor of ‘Young Justice: Phantoms,’ Animated Series, US","Daniel Rakete Siegel, Director of ‘Schock (WT),’ Feature Film, Germany","David Maria Vogel BFS, First Assistant Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany/Switzerland","David Peterson, Editor of ‘Bluey,’ TV Animated Series, Australia","David Wieching BFS, Editor of ‘Schock,’ Feature Film, Germany","Dayyan Eng, Editor of ‘Wished,’ Feature Film, China","Dear Tim Cook,","Debby Germino, Editor of ‘Genius,’ TV Drama Series, US","Dimitri Amar, Editor of ‘Marianne,’ TV Drama Series, France","Dirk Grau, Editor of ‘Charite II ,’ TV Drama Series, Germany","Fabien Leroy, Editor of ‘Graines d'étoiles, 5 ans après,’ TV Documentary Series, France","Fernanda Tornaghi, Editor of ‘Girl in the Picture,’ Feature Documentary, US","Final Cut Pro is a wonderful application used by many YouTubers, education and small business content creators worldwide.

Known for its powerful capabilities and intuitive interface, Final Cut Pro has come a long way since its inception. Today, let's explore this extraordinary journey of innovation and technological progression."]},{"l":"The Genesis of an Idea","p":["The story begins with Randy Ubillos, a name widely associated with the creation of the first three versions of Adobe Premiere Pro. His team's knack for developing professional video editing programs was then recognized by Macromedia, leading them to embark on a new project, KeyGrip.","KeyGrip was a more professional video editing program, built on Apple's QuickTime, which was intended for Macromedia's portfolio. However, due to licensing issues with Truevision, and Macromedia's shift towards web market solutions, the project hit a roadblock. Macromedia decided to sell its desktop applications, including the embryonic KeyGrip."]},{"l":"Birth of the Final Cut Pro","p":["In a pivotal year of 1998, KeyGrip was renamed Final Cut, and showcased as a 0.9 alpha version at the NAB Show. With no buyers, Apple, recognizing the potential of the software, stepped in and acquired the development team.","Contrary to expectations, Apple continued the development work, despite the lack of a buyer. The team made significant enhancements to the software, such as adding FireWire support, and finally, in 1999, it was released as Final Cut Pro at the NAB show."]},{"l":"Building a Community","p":["To ensure that Final Cut Pro received solid support from the start, Apple adopted an aggressive marketing and training strategy. They joined forces with DVcreators.net to launch a training disc, \"Final Cut Pro PowerStart\", and hosted hundreds of free and paid seminars worldwide. This strategy significantly boosted the software's early market visibility and success.","During this time, Final Cut Pro also capitalized on the decline of Adobe Premiere in the Mac market. A strategic trade-in program in 2003 allowed Adobe Premiere users to switch to Final Cut Express for free or avail of a hefty discount on Final Cut Pro."]},{"l":"Pioneering Broadcast Quality","p":["A defining factor in the success of Final Cut Pro was the robust QuickTime platform, particularly its support for new DV cameras connected via FireWire. The software found its application in the production of the first fully broadcast quality, globally distributed TV show, Women of Wrestling in 2000. Networks, such as Oxygen, also adopted the software to produce shows like SheCommerce.","By 2003, Final Cut Pro was credited for facilitating the production of the controversial film \"PlayCouples, A New Era of Swinging\". The software demonstrated its reliability during the film rendering, and this positive experience led to more endorsements from industry professionals. Such endorsements boosted its acceptance as a professional editing tool and culminated in a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its influence on the television industry in 2002."]},{"l":"The Evolution of Final Cut Pro","p":["Final Cut Pro continued to evolve, with the 4th version in 2003, introducing new applications such as Compressor, LiveType, and Soundtrack for advanced editing needs. Over time, the software strengthened its support for various video formats and integrated with additional tools to provide a comprehensive editing solution.","By 2006, Apple stopped selling Final Cut Pro as a standalone product, making it available only as part of the Final Cut Studio bundle. It also introduced the universal binary version, enhancing the software's flexibility and performance.","Subsequent versions, Final Cut Pro 6 and 7, introduced in 2007 and 2009 respectively, brought more functionalities and integrations. Despite its growing capabilities, the software remained a 32-bit application until Final Cut Pro 7."]},{"i":"final-cut-pro-x-a-revolution-in-the-editing-world","l":"Final Cut Pro X: A Revolution in the Editing World","p":["In 2011, Apple launched a major new iteration of its popular video editing software - Final Cut Pro X. This version represented a significant departure from its predecessors, bringing both praise and criticism for its novel approach."]},{"l":"The Launch and Initial Response","p":["The launch of Final Cut Pro X(also known as FCPX or FCP 10) in June 2011, stirred up quite a controversy within the industry. The significant changes implemented by Apple shook many long-time users. Some of the main points of contention were the lack of backward compatibility with projects from previous versions and the initial absence of features like multi-cam editing and the ability to edit tape-based media.","Notably, there was also a transition in the distribution model, as Apple decided to make the software available only via download through the Mac App Store. This change proved challenging for mass enterprise deployment.","To gain an idea of the extent of the initial backlash, you can watch Conan O'Brien's satirical response on his talk show."]},{"l":"Behind the Scenes","p":["Phil Pan on Alex4D's Facebook Group, from the development team reveals that much of the advanced work from the core Shake team during this time was focused on the Helium renderer, a technology that is still central to Apple's Pro Apps today.","Interestingly, Phil indicated that management was more invested in projects such as Motion and Aperture that resonated with Steve Jobs and less in Shake. During this time, Apple acquired French mathematician Christophe Souchard's Senso technology, an advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion tool using motion vector estimation.","At Apple, Souchard’s skills impressed management so much that his position was titled \"Applied Magic.\" He contributed to the development of next-generation prototypes, introducing methods using partial differential equations. However, due to Apple's policy against releasing compute-intensive software, much of this work never saw the light of day.","The shift in Apple's focus towards mass-market and mobile devices during the final years of Steve Jobs' leadership had a profound impact on the engineering efforts in high-end imaging worldwide."]},{"l":"Rising from the Ashes","p":["Despite the tumultuous start, Apple stood firm, continuously refining and improving FCPX. Through free updates, many of the missing features were reintroduced, and new ones were added.","A significant contribution was the Magnetic Timeline, which allowed for fluid, flexible editing, simplifying the process of exploring story ideas. Additionally, the introduction of Compound Clips further streamlined complex projects.","A major leap forward came with the new 64-bit architecture and GPU utilization. This allowed editors to work with larger frame sizes, higher frame rates, and more effects — all in real-time."]},{"l":"The Current State of Final Cut Pro X","p":["Today, Final Cut Pro X has matured into a powerful and efficient editing platform. With innovative features like the Magnetic Timeline, powerful multicam support, and advanced color grading, it has won over many skeptics.","Further solidifying its place within the industry is the introduction of ProRes RAW in FCPX, making it a go-to tool for many professionals.

It's packaged as Effects, not drop zones in generators or titles, so you can trim, roll, copy and paste effects, and save effects presets just as you can with any regular clip. To get started, just drag one of the effects to one of your clips, and start tweaking the settings.","As well as a solid border color, you can use a gradient or outline gradient. Position the outline centered on the edge, the inside or outside, or use the Outline Offset to make something original. Remove the border entirely or leave just a shadow with the Fade Outside slider.","You can scale a PiP up from nothing, at a choice of speeds (Fast, Medium, Slow), or scale down from a full-screen shot to reveal a clip underneath. PiP Kit also includes a special set of transitions that only affect the connected picture, ignoring the background.","To use these, turn off the built-in transitions by unchecking the Build In and Build Out, then look in the transitions browser to find funwithstuff PiP Kit. These transitions have to be applied to the correct “in” or “out” side of a clip to work properly, but they do allow you to customise the way a clip enters or leaves the frame.","PiP Kit also includes several adjustment layer titles that change everything below them, and uniquely, these adjustments fade in and out. You can use the Obscure effects to apply your choice of blur, gamma, brightness, vignette and crystallize, which fade in and out with controllable speeds. Use the fade or wipe variants just above your background clips to make your picture-in-picture clips really stand out.","The last adjustment layer enables a very popular trick: punching in and out smoothly. Add the Zoom in and Out title, trim it to where you want the zoom to happen, then customise the speed. Easy, and useful even if you’re not using a Picture in Picture effect.","Want to contribute?

When you develop an application, your project links to one or more frameworks. For example, iPhone application projects link by default to the Foundation, UIKit, and Core Graphics frameworks. Your code accesses the capabilities of a framework through the application programming interface (API), which is published by the framework through its header files. Because the library is dynamically shared, multiple applications can access the framework code and resources simultaneously. The system loads the code and resources of a framework into memory, as needed, and shares the one copy of a resource among all applications."]},{"l":"History Lesson","p":["Phil Pan writes on Alex4D's Facebook Page:","I worked on that team for five years. There wasn't much work done on merging Shake and FCP. Most of the advanced work done by the core Shake team focused on the Helium renderer, which today is core to Pro Apps today. Shake's genius was how it was ultra-efficient as CPU-only code. Management had little interest in Shake and most resources went to Motion and Aperture; projects that Steve could related to when he wasn't completely absorbed by the iPad, the iPhone and the iTunes business ecosystem. The author of this patent, Christophe Souchard, is a French mathematician who had tons of prior experience at Discreet/Autodesk. He joined Apple when it purchased his Senso technology, which was the first Intel-based library to do advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion using motion vector estimation. While at Apple, Christophe's skills impressed management enough that his position was labelled \"Applied Magic\", and a veteran aerospace software engineer was hired to perform curation and clerical code management for his inventions. He introduced the team to methods using partial differential equations and while exteremely slow to compute, his next-generation prototypes performed jaw-dropping feats 15 years before similar tools would be introduced by Adobe. None of this work ever came out because Apple had a policy not to release compute-intensive software. Randy Ubillos (father of FCP and close to Steve) wouldn't accept any operation that took longer than a second per frame to render. This relegated Christophe to a research position for a while, until Randy got so impressed that he monopolized Christophe to work on advanced concepts for FCPX. Randy had some clever ideas about shot alignment and automatic editing, and this patent is the result of one of their collaborative projects. Today Christophe works at Unity Technologies doing advanced AR work, and he consults on the side when he has the time. He's recently rumored to have authored the rendering engine for ColorSynth, a complex colour grading plugin for FCPX and Premiere.","Helium was done in Santa Monica by the mad frenchmen team at Apple; Arnaud Hervas, Emmanuel Mogenet and Chrisophe Souchard. Arnaud was the co-founder of Nothing Real, the company that produced Shake. The idea was to do automatic tiled rendering using all available compute resources, so CPU cores and GPU(s). It was a lot trickier than people would think, as math functions would be rounded differently on different resources, and this would affect pixel values. The renderer has to evaluate the render graph to intelligently tile the proper regions-of-interest; i.e. it has to know the size of convolution kernels and all parts of a shader to produce tiles that will later merge properly, and it has to do all of this in real-time. Beautiful work. Emmanuel is now an executive at Google Research in Switzerland. Arnaud is growing tomatoes in Culver City, when he's not working on camera alignement software. Apple could have done a lot more in the high end, but in the last days of Steve, the company shifted its focus on the mass market and mobile devices. It was the right thing to do for all the reasons we know today (the Bottom Line being the most evident), but in so doing it hurt engineering effors in high-end imaging across the world; Adobe was going through a bad patch and the Discreet team at Autodesk was in disarray. The high-end was picked up by The Foundry: Its founder, Bruno Nicoletti (a Discreet alumnus) had the clever idea to acquire Nuke from Digital Domain and he had the skills and industry knowledge to turn it into the work-horse that it's become today. Still, Nuke is a geek's tool and there could have been an opportunity for a more artist-oriented solution in the high-end. This would not be one of Apple's pursuits: After a couple of years of soul-searching it became clear in 2007 that the future of Apple would be the iPhone and that all the Pro Apps stuff was no longer interesting. It survived nonetheless and I'd say that today the spirit of high(ish) end imaging is coming back to Apple. But so is the case at Adobe. In the end, the consumer wins and it's an exciting time to be buying graphics solutions."]},{"l":"Plugins","p":["Internally, Final Cut Pro supports and contains a number of different plugin types and formats:"]},{"l":"Compressor","p":["Contains CompressorKit.bundle- which can also be found in Compressor and Motion - it's basically the Compressor engine."]},{"l":"FCP-DAL","p":["Contains ACD.plugin- a CoreMediaIO plugin that enables the \"A/V Output\" feature in Final Cut Pro.","The CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) is analogous to CoreAudio’s Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

Let the adventure begin!"]},{"l":"Core Data","p":["Before we dig too deep into the Final Cut Pro library, it's important to understand one of the core technologies Apple uses in Final Cut Pro - Core Data.","Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple in the macOS and iOS operating systems. More than 13 years old now (at the time of writing), Core Data was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and iOS with iPhone SDK 3.0 and like many parts of macOS, Core Data owes much of its design to an earlier NeXT product, Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF).","You can watch the original 2004 WWDC session on Core Data here.","You can read Apple's official developer documentation on Core Data here.","Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in an application. It provides generalised and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management, including persistence (meaning that, for example, an iPhone App can remember its settings each time the phone is turned off and on again).","It allows data organised by the relational entity–attribute model to be serialised into XML, binary, or SQLite stores. The data can be manipulated using higher level objects representing entities and their relationships. Core Data manages the serialised version.","Core Data can interface directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL - but it's not a SQL wrapper, and offers a much higher level of abstraction. Instead of writing SQL, you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request. However, because Core Data can use SQLite, it's easy to get confused with the differences between SQLite and Core Data. Remember that Core Data isn’t a database. If you want an Object-relational mapping (O/RM) or SQL wrapper, Core Data is not what you want.","Essentially, Core Data is a model layer technology, that's been designed to help programmers do lots of cool stuff, whilst writing less code. It's a toolkit that allows developers to more easily access and manipulate data. For example, it has built-in undo/redo management, allowing developers to add complex undo/redo functionality to their applications with minimum code.","Even though Core Data is a fantastic framework, there are several drawbacks. These drawbacks are directly related to the nature of the framework and how it works.","Core Data can only do its magic because it keeps the object graph it manages in memory. This means that it can only operate on records once they’re in memory. This is very different from performing a SQL query on a database. If you want to delete thousands of records, Core Data first needs to load each record into memory. It goes without saying that this results in memory and performance issues if done incorrectly.","Another important limitation is the threading model of Core Data. The framework expects to be run on a single thread. Fortunately, Core Data has evolved dramatically over the years and the framework has put various solutions in place to make working with Core Data in a multithreaded environment safer and easier.","For applications that need to manage a complex object graph (i.e. Final Cut Pro), Core Data is a great fit."]},{"l":"DeepSkyLite","p":["Final Cut Pro uses a lot of internal Frameworks, which you can learn more about here.","Within the Flexo Framework, is a framework called DeepSkyLite, which is essentially the \"database engine\" for Final Cut Pro.","Inside the DeepSkyLite Framework is two Compiled Core Data Models:","DSLite_v1.mom","DSLite_v2b1.mom","A .mom file is a binary property list that's NSKeyedArchiver encoded. You can easily open it up in something like BBEdit and have a look, but the easiest and best way to explore a Core Data Model is to just import it back into Xcode.","Here's what Final Cut Pro's model looks like in Xcode:","Patent Screenshot","Interestingly, this model is used for both Final Cut Pro on Mac and Final Cut Pro for iPad."]}],[{"l":"Patents","p":["Alex4D has a great blog post on the Magnetic Timeline patent (Media-editing application with media clips grouping capabilities) here.","The actual patent can be found here.","Here's one of the screenshots from the patent:","Patent Screenshot"]},{"l":"Patents on Google Patents","p":["...it's a deep rabbit hole, enjoy!","Accelerator handles","Adjustment of color values for optimized image processing","Anchor point in media","Application for designing journals","Applying a Realistic Artistic Texture to Images","Associating keywords to media","Auto stacking of related images","Automatic generation of multi-camera media clips","Boolean Search User Interface","Christophe Souchard","Colleen Pendergast","Color adjustors for color segments","Context aware user interface for image editing","Context based adaptive image resampling","Display of multiple images","Edit to tape","Estimating and removing lens distortion from scenes","Fanning user interface control for medium editing application","Fanning user interface controls for a media editing application","Fast creation of video segments","Here's a small collection of Final Cut Pro related patents:","Import directly into specified folders and user interface","Interactive image thumbnails","Ken Matsuda","Media-editing application with media clips grouping capabilities","Method and apparatus for color correction","Method and apparatus for dynamically resizing windows","Method and interface for converting images to grayscale","Modified media presentation during scrubbing","Navigating Image Presentations","Navigation within a large computer file","Optimizing the Execution of Media Processing Routines Using a List of Routine Identifiers","Previewing effects applicable to digital media content","Producing Smooth Motion Compensated Frames by Combining Multiple Interpolation Results","Publishing Media Content to Virtual Movie Theatres","Randy Ubillos","Regular sampling and presentation of continuous media stream","Retiming media presentations","Rolling shutter distortion correction","Select drag and drop operations on video thumbnails across clip boundaries","Smoothing and/or locking operations in video editing","Spatial and temporal alignment of video sequences","Spatial conform operation for a media-editing application","Split edits","Synchronizing video with audio beats","Techniques for displaying digital images on a display","Two-dimensional timeline display of media items","Unified slider control for modifying multiple image properties","User interface tools for selectively applying effects to image","User interfaces for editing video clips","Video and audio waveform user interface","Video format for digital video recorder","Viewing digital images on a display using a virtual loupe","Viewing digital images using a floating controller","Visual presentation composition","Want to contribute?

This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.","A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or \"project,\" you often work on your own copy, or \"branch\". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a \"pull request\". This is a proposal that says \"I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project\".","Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they \"merge\" them into the shared project.
