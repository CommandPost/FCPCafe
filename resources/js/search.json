Whilst this is all done in the hardware, there's still some overhead, which is why it won't split things up for shorter clips (as you'll waste time combining them at the end).","Bugs:","Collapse to Connected Storyline has been added as COMMAND+SHIFT+DOWN.","Command Sets:","CommandPost has had a scrolling timeline in Final Cut Pro since 2016.","Dylan Bates/The Final Cut Bro's \"What's New in the Final Cut Pro 10.7 | Should you update?\"","Faster HEVC & H.264 Exports:","Faster HEVC and H.264 export will only happen if you're using macOS Sonoma and a Mac with Apple M1 Max, M1 Ultra, M2 Max, M2 Ultra, or M3 Max.","FCPXML:","For a number of years now, CommandPost has had a Reveal in Keyword Collection action:","For example, random red lines in the Timeline for no apparent reason:","For example, you won't get faster exports if you have a 30sec or 1min timeline, but a feature length film you'll see improvements.","Funnily enough, in an very early version of CommandPost, we also had a feature called Timeline Playhead Lock, which locked the timeline playhead to the centre of the timeline - but this feature was removed at some point as very few people actually used it.","FWIW - the CommandPost scrolling timeline still works in Final Cut Pro 10.7, so you can still keep using it if you prefer it to the official scrolling timeline.","However, generally speaking, it's been pretty rock solid - even when enabling the Scrolling Timeline on our massive Blackmagic RAW test timeline, which is full of all kinds of weird and wonderful BRAW clips in all different types of frame sizes, frame rates and aspect ratios.","However, if no Keyword or Smart Collection is currently selected, it will still just match back to the Event.","However, if you turn on the scrolling timeline and then turn it off again, FFGenerateThumbnailsDuringPlayback will also be disabled again.","I'm sure eventually, once you can no longer install the latest macOS and Final Cut Pro on Intel machines, then Apple will make generating thumbnails & waveforms during playback always on - not just when you have the scrolling timeline enabled.","I've been able to make it crash using third party Audio Units, even after selecting Settings > General > Audio Units > Validate on Next Launch.","Iain Anderson's \"What's New in Final Cut 10.7\"","If you can reproduce this issue, please let us know in FB13434977.","If you can reproduce, please report it in FB13435003.","If you can reproduce, please report it in FB13435050.","If you haven't already, you can read all the release notes in yesterday's post.","If you see something similar, please report it in FB13434993.","If you spot any bugs or issues, please make sure you report them on the Bug Tracker.

This was reported as FB12868396. Thanks Apple!","The fact that you can now import iMovie for iOS projects into Final Cut Pro for iPad might be a hint that native Mac to iPad is also on their radar/wish-list.","The Final Cut Pro Library Database version has also been updated to 1090, compared to 1071 in Final Cut Pro 10.6.10.","The Inspector button tooltips have disappeared - it now just says:","The most exciting change to Final Cut Pro 10.7 is the addition of a Scrolling Timeline.","The new Scrolling Timeline in Final Cut Pro 10.7 is definitely a big improvement from what CommandPost can offer, and is a really nice implementation, as you'll see in the various videos linked to above. Richard Taylor is VERY happy.","The only two Command Editor items between Final Cut Pro 10.6.10 and 10.7.0 are Collapse to Connected Storyline and Timeline Scrolling.","The relink progress bar has been improved, so that the progress bar doesn't \"block\" the Relink panel interface. This means that as things relink in the progress bar, you can visually see things get removed in the matched files list.","The Scrolling Timeline sometimes misbehaves at certain Zoom Levels. This is discussed in FB13436367.","There have been no changes/updates to FCPXML in this update - it still uses FCPXML v1.11.","There's lots of great videos out there talking about this update, such as:","They also replaced a lot of OS X to macOS in various warnings and error messages.","They did however follow the more recent macOS naming conventions, and renamed the Preferences item to Settings.","This also explains why it's disabled by default (along with generating thumbnails & waveforms during playback), as it runs pretty slow/laggy on very complex projects/timelines, especially on older Intel hardware, and Apple don't want new users to experience that straight out of the box - hence scrolling timeline is \"hidden\" in the preferences, and not with a simple toolbar button.","This could prove to be a major regression- but we need to do some more testing to confirm exactly what's going on. So far some other users have been able to reproduce this, so it looks like a bug sadly.","This feature still works great on Final Cut Pro 10.7, and can be handy when you want to quickly match back to a Keyword Collection, rather than an Event.","This has been reported to Apple many times over the years. If this bug annoys you, please file feedback via Feedback Assistant referencing FB13434162.","This means that any Libraries created prior to Final Cut Pro 10.7 will need to be updated to the latest format, and you can't go back from 10.7 to earlier versions of Final Cut Pro.","Tight.

He's a REALLY great interviewer.","Media Management Techniques with Mark Spencer","Microphones were handed around, and anyone could ask anything.","MotionVFX's session was also insanely awesome. What I didn't realise was this wasn't a MotionVFX session - as in, there were no MotionVFX staff attending. MotionVFX basically just paid for one of their external contractors, Seed Media to do a talk about MotionVFX's new subscription tools, CineStudio.","Next I attended Iain Anderson's Hooking in Hardware session - which showcased how he uses CommandPost+ MIDI Controllers + Tangent Ripple + Monogram Console to control Final Cut Pro in fast and powerful ways.","Obviously, with Apple being a giant complex company - the team couldn't talk about anything unannounced or future product plans.","Onwards & Upwards!","Over the last few weeks, I've had... concerns, about whether or not flying across the world to hang out with a bunch of Final Cut Pro editors would be a... bad investment/waste of time or not. By the time you add flights, accommodation, conference cost, food, social drinks, etc - it becomes a very expensive endeavour, and a long time away from my young family.

It was by far the most polished and slick talk of the whole conference - I really felt like I was in a University classroom for the 45mins. Steve is such a great educator and communicator - he really takes it to another level ( Mike Seymour-level as I like to call it).","Thank you to Richard Taylor for allowing people at home that couldn't attend the Summit in person to still feel connected to the event via his live streams.","The Apple team said that Final Cut Pro and ProApps are \"alive and well\" and the team is \"super excited about the future\".","The audience all learnt a new term - S.P.O.D'ing - spinning pizza of death (i.e. the spinning wheel of death). They explained that if you do ever run into the spinning wheel of doom, sending detailed feedback of exactly how you got into this state is very, very helpful.","The Final Cut Pro team constantly have meetings with the wider Apple teams - for example, they're constantly meeting with Machine Learning teams to see what technologies and techniques they can bring back to the ProApps.","Then finally, to wrap up the conference, we had a Q&A with the Final Cut Pro team - what a perfect way to wrap up the event!","There were six people from Apple on the stage from marketing, engineering, quality control, user interface design and product manager for Final Cut Pro for iPad.","These kinds of panels are what makes the Summit so powerful and so useful - true industry professionals, doing world-class high-end work, talking about their craft. Josh, Mike & Robin are all three of the nicest, smartest and honest people you'll ever meet - and it's such an honour to hear about how they make their amazing art.","They mentioned they're really interested in seeing how people are using Final Cut Pro on iPad. They encourage people to send feedback to them, explaining in story form how you use their devices in the real world.","They said \"don't worry about the Aperture thing... it's not a thing\" - referring to the fact that Final Cut Pro won't go the way of Aperture, and be suddenly discontinued.","This event wasn't under NDA - however they asked for no photos, videos or recordings.","This is the first time I (Chris Hocking) have personally attended the Summit, and it's a looooooooong and expensive trip from Melbourne, Australia.","Tight.

If you have the sound effect Keyword Collection selected in the Browser, and you Reveal in Browser on a sound effect on the timeline, it will find that clip in the Browser, without changing the currently selected Keyword Collection.","For example, you could create a Collection for \"Episode 1\" and \"Episode 2\", which each contains it's own Final Cut Pro Library.

We will be releasing a case study about this film in the future.","I only personally attended Mark's first session - which was awesome, as you'd expect.","I only personally attended the PostLab session and Dylan's session - which was really great.

For example, if you wanted to build a colour correction tool with powerful masking features, you could use OSCar Rectangle to allow your users to draw masks via an on-screen tool in the Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro Viewer.","Whilst OSCar Rectangle has been written in Objective-C using the FxPlug4 API (Apple Motion's Effects API for third party developers) - it's easily accessible within Apple's Motion, just like regular built-in tools, so anyone who's making Motion Templates in Apple Motion can make use of this functionality without knowing any code. Essentially these are tools to make it easier for people to make awesome Motion Templates, which can then be \"exposed\" in Final Cut Pro.","Luke is currently demonstrating OSCar Rectangle via a series of YouTube videos, with the intention of trying to raise funds to cover a new Mac and Apple Developer Account via this Indiegogo campaign. If he can raise the necessary funds to finish OSCar Rectangle, he will release the software for free, and potentially even open-source.","There are very few FxPlug4 developers in the world, especially in terms of solo indie developers - so it's awesome to see Luke really tackling uncharted territory. These tools could potentially be game-changers to the growing list of Final Cut Pro YouTuber's that are also building their own Motion Templates to sell.","OSCar Rectangle is still very much a work-in-progress, with a beta build hopefully coming in the coming weeks.","You can learn more about OSCar Rectangle and his other Luke’s Got Groups project here.","You can find the Indiegogo project here.","CommandPost v1.4.22 is out now!","This is just a quick small update with a few new features.

In previous years (2015-2019) we visited the old Apple campus, but this time we get to go to the shiny new one. There have been Global Summits held online, but they’re absolutely not the same. Yes, you can learn new things, but if you can’t eat too much Korean barbecue with new friends, it’s just not the same.","On the main two days of the conference, there will be many talks worth attending; some panels, a big, fun tip show, and plenty of talks in two separate tracks. I’m giving three talks (on 3D objects, 360° editing, hardware device) and I’ll be shamelessly bribing people to come to my talks with free koala giveaways. You can see a full list of almost all the speakers here and see a nearly-complete program here; you should find something for everyone.

They have worked very hard for over a decade on making Final Cut Pro better and better. This open letter is aimed at the executives who set the priorities of the Final Cut Pro development team and the Apple managers whose policies limit the public marketing of Final Cut Pro to a couple of website updates a year and some mentions in Apple keynotes about how much faster Apple hardware is getting.","The letter’s signatories aim was to encourage Apple to make a new commitment to the professional TV and filmmaking industry. They believe that would potentially benefit filmmakers the world over regardless of their personal NLE preferences.","Competition is a positive. Apple has demonstrated a willingness to swing big. The very fact that they are not exclusively tethered to our industry allows them to try things others likely can’t. We hope you’ll support us in encouraging one of the heaviest hitters in media and technology to more forcefully push the boundaries of all of our tools.","They gathered some comments about Final Cut Pro and Apple:","Galliano Olivier, editor of ‘Marianne,’ a French TV drama series edited in Final Cut and distributed by Netflix says “In France, it is extremely difficult to get permission to edit TV with Final Cut Pro. You can’t use it without fighting producers, directors, post-production supervisors, sound editors, etc...”","Knut Hake BFS, editor of ‘Blood Red Sky,’ a feature film distributed by Netflix and edited using Final Cut Pro commented, “I think it would make a big difference for workflow consultants, systems integrators and third-party developers if there was a public Beta program for Final Cut Pro. Apple already do it for iOS, macOS and even Safari. It would make Final Cut more reliable and make it much easier for people to fit Final Cut into their plans for the future.”","Steven Sanders, editor in chief of of the Fox TV series ‘War of the Worlds’ season 3 said “The two main reasons why I am often not allowed to chose my favourite editing application, which is Final Cut Pro are: 1. Collaboration! Editing big productions needs collaboration. Different users have to be able to access the same library at the same time. There is no way around this. Avid Media Composer does it and even DaVinci Resolve does it. Apple still targets the single user. They have to change that. That will change everything. 2. Many professionals do not know how Final Cut works. They are afraid of it, even regard is as ‘iMovie Pro.’ I hear that all the time in my business. This perception really has to change.\"","Vanessa E. Brogna, assistant editor of ‘Bridgerton’ one of the top TV shows on Netflix commented: “Final Cut Pro is my favorite NLE. It's an absolute powerhouse and I feel the most creative and productive. Doing one step in Final Cut is about 3-4 in other NLEs. However, the real magic of Final Cut is its free form style of editing. Editing on a magnetic timeline is streamlined and smooth so I can still be organized, but I'm able to spend more time experimenting in the edit creatively and finesse my work.“","Jeff Asher, editor of ‘Big Sky,’ a US TV series on ABC and Hulu, says “As a TV editor, my job consists of being creative and being fast. Final Cut is the best NLE to achieve both of those goals. Now we need Apple on board with a roadmap and open dialogue with Film and TV creators to restore confidence lost over ten years ago.”"]},{"l":"Press"},{"l":"Before","p":["An open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro, signed by editors and post-production pros around the world (ProVideo Coalition)"]},{"i":"after","l":"After:","p":["Apple responds to the open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro (ProVideo Coalition)","Apple responds to open letter about improving usage and reputation of Final Cut Pro in filmmaking industry (9to5mac)","Apple Response to “Final Cut Pro in TV and Film” Open Letter (fcp.co)","Apple Responds to Open Letter Demanding Improvement of Final Cut Pro (PetaPixel)"]},{"i":"open-letter-19th-april-2022","l":"Open Letter (19th April 2022)","p":["Abbas Fahdel, Director of ‘Homeland: Iraq Year Zero,’ Feature Documentary, Iraq","Andrea Chignoli, Editor of ‘\"No\" directed by Pablo Larrain,’ Feature Film, Chile","Andreas Menn, Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany+Swiss","Andrew McKee BFE, Editor of ‘Eaten by Lions,’ Feature Film, UK","Azusa Yamazaki, Editor of ‘Drive My Car,’ Feature Film, Japan","Benjamin Ikes, Editor of ‘Buba,’ Feature Film, Germany","Benjamin Mercer F.C.E, Editor of ‘Unknown Soldier / Tuntematon Sotilas,’ Feature Film, Finland","Beverly Maguire BFE, Editor of ‘It’s Pony,’ Animated TV series, UK","Bo Li, Editor of ‘Plastic China,’ Feature Documentary, China","Brad Stoddard, Finish Editor / Colorist of ‘Sakura & Pearls: Healing From World War II ,’ Feature Documentary, US","Brett Ramsey, Editor of ‘In Pit Lane ,’ TV News, Australia","Brian Zwiener, Assistant Editor of ‘Terminator: Dark Fate,’ Feature Film, US","Carsten Behrendt, Editor of ‘Helden der Hauptstadt,’ Feature Documentary, Germany","Chad Tremblay, Editor of ‘Hunter Hunter,’ Feature Film, Canada","Chankanet Leksomboon, First Assistant Editor of ‘Bangkok Breaking,’ TV Drama Series, Thailand","Chris Black, Editor of ‘Fly the flag for Human Rights',’ TV Documentary Series, UK","Chris Hocking, Editor of ‘Neighbours: Erinsborough High,’ TV Limited Series/Mini Series, Australia","Christopher Darlington, Editor of ‘The Uncluttered Worlds of Christopher Pratt,’ Feature Documentary, Canada","Clark N Henderson, Assistant Editor of ‘Paramedics: Emergency Response,’ TV Factual Series, Canada","Cris Mertens, Editor of ‘Young Justice: Phantoms,’ Animated Series, US","Daniel Rakete Siegel, Director of ‘Schock (WT),’ Feature Film, Germany","David Maria Vogel BFS, First Assistant Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany/Switzerland","David Peterson, Editor of ‘Bluey,’ TV Animated Series, Australia","David Wieching BFS, Editor of ‘Schock,’ Feature Film, Germany","Dayyan Eng, Editor of ‘Wished,’ Feature Film, China","Dear Tim Cook,","Debby Germino, Editor of ‘Genius,’ TV Drama Series, US","Dimitri Amar, Editor of ‘Marianne,’ TV Drama Series, France","Dirk Grau, Editor of ‘Charite II ,’ TV Drama Series, Germany","Fabien Leroy, Editor of ‘Graines d'étoiles, 5 ans après,’ TV Documentary Series, France","Fernanda Tornaghi, Editor of ‘Girl in the Picture,’ Feature Documentary, US","Final Cut Pro is a wonderful application used by many YouTubers, education and small business content creators worldwide.

Familiarize yourself with the most commonly used ones, like \"i\" for setting an in-point, \"o\" for an out-point, and \"space\" for play/pause.","Use Proxy Media: When dealing with high-resolution video like 4K or 8K, editing can become sluggish. Use Final Cut Pro's proxy media feature, which allows you to create lower-resolution versions of your footage for smoother editing. When you're done, you can switch back to the full-resolution media for final output.","Organize Your Media: Keep your footage and assets well-organized. Use libraries, events, and keywords to categorize and manage your footage. This will make finding and accessing the clips you need much faster.","Use Presets: If you find yourself often applying the same settings or effects, save them as presets. This can be done for color grading, audio effects, and more.","Optimize Your Hardware: Make sure your computer is up to the task. Keep your software up to date, ensure you have enough free storage space, and consider upgrades to your RAM or GPU if necessary.","Batch Operations: Perform tasks such as transcoding, rendering, and exporting in batches, ideally during downtime, to avoid interrupting your editing flow.","Learn to Use the Magnetic Timeline: The magnetic timeline is one of Final Cut Pro's unique features. It helps maintain synchronization when moving clips around, which can save you time rearranging your timeline.","Color Coding: Use color coding for your clips and timelines. This can help you quickly locate related material or sequences.","Use the Skimming Feature: The skimming feature allows you to quickly review your footage and makes cutting and trimming faster.","Storyboard Your Videos: Before even starting with Final Cut Pro, have a clear idea of what you want to achieve. A storyboard or script can reduce the time spent experimenting with different edits.","Remember that like any skill, speed comes with practice. The more you use Final Cut Pro and become familiar with its features, the faster you will get."]},{"i":"effects---overview","l":"Effects - Overview","p":["Final Cut Pro comes with a variety of built-in effects that you can apply to your video clips.

This could be a deciding factor if you're not using Apple hardware.","Pricing Model: Final Cut Pro offers a one-time purchase, which can be more affordable in the long run. On the other hand, Adobe Premiere Pro follows a subscription model that can be more flexible and also includes updates as long as the subscription is active, but tends to be more expensive over time.","Performance: Final Cut Pro is known for its performance optimization for Apple hardware, which can make it run more smoothly on Macs. Adobe Premiere Pro can also deliver good performance but may not be as optimized for specific hardware.","Interface and Workflow: Final Cut Pro uses a Magnetic Timeline, which offers a different editing experience by automatically moving clips to avoid gaps and collisions. Premiere Pro uses a more traditional track-based timeline, which can be more intuitive to those coming from other editing software. This aspect largely comes down to personal preference.","Integration with Other Software: Premiere Pro is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, so it integrates very well with other Adobe products like After Effects and Photoshop. Final Cut Pro also has some level of integration with other Apple software like Motion and Compressor, but the Adobe ecosystem is generally more extensive.","Learning Curve: Both programs have a steep learning curve due to their advanced capabilities, but some users find Final Cut Pro to be more user-friendly initially.","Support for Formats and Codecs: Both support a wide range of video formats and codecs, but there may be differences in support for specific formats. For example, you'll need to use a third party solution called BRAW Toolbox to use BRAW files in Final Cut Pro.","Collaboration Features: Adobe Premiere Pro has a feature called \"Team Projects\" for cloud-based collaboration between editors.

Known for its powerful capabilities and intuitive interface, Final Cut Pro has come a long way since its inception. Today, let's explore this extraordinary journey of innovation and technological progression."]},{"l":"The Genesis of an Idea","p":["The story begins with Randy Ubillos, a name widely associated with the creation of the first three versions of Adobe Premiere Pro. His team's knack for developing professional video editing programs was then recognized by Macromedia, leading them to embark on a new project, KeyGrip.","KeyGrip was a more professional video editing program, built on Apple's QuickTime, which was intended for Macromedia's portfolio. However, due to licensing issues with Truevision, and Macromedia's shift towards web market solutions, the project hit a roadblock. Macromedia decided to sell its desktop applications, including the embryonic KeyGrip."]},{"l":"Birth of the Final Cut Pro","p":["In a pivotal year of 1998, KeyGrip was renamed Final Cut, and showcased as a 0.9 alpha version at the NAB Show. With no buyers, Apple, recognizing the potential of the software, stepped in and acquired the development team.","Contrary to expectations, Apple continued the development work, despite the lack of a buyer. The team made significant enhancements to the software, such as adding FireWire support, and finally, in 1999, it was released as Final Cut Pro at the NAB show."]},{"l":"Building a Community","p":["To ensure that Final Cut Pro received solid support from the start, Apple adopted an aggressive marketing and training strategy. They joined forces with DVcreators.net to launch a training disc, \"Final Cut Pro PowerStart\", and hosted hundreds of free and paid seminars worldwide. This strategy significantly boosted the software's early market visibility and success.","During this time, Final Cut Pro also capitalized on the decline of Adobe Premiere in the Mac market. A strategic trade-in program in 2003 allowed Adobe Premiere users to switch to Final Cut Express for free or avail of a hefty discount on Final Cut Pro."]},{"l":"Pioneering Broadcast Quality","p":["A defining factor in the success of Final Cut Pro was the robust QuickTime platform, particularly its support for new DV cameras connected via FireWire. The software found its application in the production of the first fully broadcast quality, globally distributed TV show, Women of Wrestling in 2000. Networks, such as Oxygen, also adopted the software to produce shows like SheCommerce.","By 2003, Final Cut Pro was credited for facilitating the production of the controversial film \"PlayCouples, A New Era of Swinging\". The software demonstrated its reliability during the film rendering, and this positive experience led to more endorsements from industry professionals. Such endorsements boosted its acceptance as a professional editing tool and culminated in a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its influence on the television industry in 2002."]},{"l":"The Evolution of Final Cut Pro","p":["Final Cut Pro continued to evolve, with the 4th version in 2003, introducing new applications such as Compressor, LiveType, and Soundtrack for advanced editing needs. Over time, the software strengthened its support for various video formats and integrated with additional tools to provide a comprehensive editing solution.","By 2006, Apple stopped selling Final Cut Pro as a standalone product, making it available only as part of the Final Cut Studio bundle. It also introduced the universal binary version, enhancing the software's flexibility and performance.","Subsequent versions, Final Cut Pro 6 and 7, introduced in 2007 and 2009 respectively, brought more functionalities and integrations. Despite its growing capabilities, the software remained a 32-bit application until Final Cut Pro 7."]},{"i":"final-cut-pro-x-a-revolution-in-the-editing-world","l":"Final Cut Pro X: A Revolution in the Editing World","p":["In 2011, Apple launched a major new iteration of its popular video editing software - Final Cut Pro X.

The significant changes implemented by Apple shook many long-time users. Some of the main points of contention were the lack of backward compatibility with projects from previous versions and the initial absence of features like multi-cam editing and the ability to edit tape-based media.","Notably, there was also a transition in the distribution model, as Apple decided to make the software available only via download through the Mac App Store. This change proved challenging for mass enterprise deployment.","To gain an idea of the extent of the initial backlash, you can watch Conan O'Brien's satirical response on his talk show."]},{"l":"Behind the Scenes","p":["Phil Pan on Alex4D's Facebook Group, from the development team reveals that much of the advanced work from the core Shake team during this time was focused on the Helium renderer, a technology that is still central to Apple's Pro Apps today.","Interestingly, Phil indicated that management was more invested in projects such as Motion and Aperture that resonated with Steve Jobs and less in Shake. During this time, Apple acquired French mathematician Christophe Souchard's Senso technology, an advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion tool using motion vector estimation.","At Apple, Souchard’s skills impressed management so much that his position was titled \"Applied Magic.\" He contributed to the development of next-generation prototypes, introducing methods using partial differential equations. However, due to Apple's policy against releasing compute-intensive software, much of this work never saw the light of day.","The shift in Apple's focus towards mass-market and mobile devices during the final years of Steve Jobs' leadership had a profound impact on the engineering efforts in high-end imaging worldwide."]},{"l":"Rising from the Ashes","p":["Despite the tumultuous start, Apple stood firm, continuously refining and improving FCPX. Through free updates, many of the missing features were reintroduced, and new ones were added.","A significant contribution was the Magnetic Timeline, which allowed for fluid, flexible editing, simplifying the process of exploring story ideas. Additionally, the introduction of Compound Clips further streamlined complex projects.","A major leap forward came with the new 64-bit architecture and GPU utilization. This allowed editors to work with larger frame sizes, higher frame rates, and more effects — all in real-time."]},{"l":"The Current State of Final Cut Pro X","p":["Today, Final Cut Pro X has matured into a powerful and efficient editing platform.

Surely a must have for me and hopefully you as well.","Jason Mark Williams","An amazing guide through FCPX, for both novices and experienced editors.","Forget your old stereo instructions. For a technical manual, this book is a very easy and enjoyable read.","What it is: a wide-ranging look at all things Final Cut Pro X. That means it’s written with sections for editing novices, which go over the absolute basics. And other sections aimed at experienced editors who either want to learn a new NLE (non-linear editor), or who know the basics of Final Cut and want to improve their workflow with efficiencies they haven’t discovered yet. The book even has a section on basic production tips for those who need the help. Personally, I am a highly experienced editor (who does not do production work) so I just skimmed that section, but even skimming it I picked up a few technical production details I wasn’t aware of before.","But the meat and bones focuses on using Final Cut Pro X. And it’s fantastic! Iain Anderson is a gifted teacher, able to explain concepts and fine points to novices and experienced editors alike with easy readability. The sections are so clearly delineated that it’s easy to jump to specific knowledge you are looking for, or you can just work your way through the book from start to finish.","Highly recommended for those wanting to dive into FCPX’s depths, or who want to dip their toes in the water for the first time.","M. Yanovich","Exactly as described. Excellent Book.","This thick book has everything you want to know about editing. Great value and fast delivery.","I would highly recommend this purchase.

In this post, we will explore the best practices for using Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing. This will ensure your workflow is optimized, your output is professional, and your editing process is efficient."]},{"l":"Organise Your Workflow","p":["Create a Sound Workflow Structure:","Before starting the editing process, it's crucial to establish a well-structured workflow. In the context of long-form feature films, this often involves breaking down your project into scenes or sequences, each with its own dedicated project file within Final Cut Pro. This allows for focused editing and simplifies collaboration, as different editors can work on different scenes simultaneously.","Consistent Naming Conventions:","Consistency is key to smooth editing, especially for large projects like feature films. Use consistent naming conventions for your clips, sequences, and projects. This will make it much easier to locate and identify specific assets as your project grows.","Leverage Metadata:","Final Cut Pro allows users to input and leverage metadata for clips, such as scene number, shot number, take number, and more. You can also add custom metadata. Using metadata effectively can greatly enhance organization and searchability within your project."]},{"l":"Understanding RAM Requirements","p":["One crucial aspect of achieving optimal performance with Final Cut Pro revolves around understanding and addressing the software's RAM requirements. In particular, running FCP on Apple silicon (Apple's own line of processors) requires careful consideration. As all new Macs now use Apple silicon, it's important to get this right.","Apple Silicon and Unified Memory:","Unlike traditional computer architecture, where the CPU and GPU have separate memory (RAM and VRAM), Apple Silicon uses a unified memory architecture. This means that the CPU and GPU share the same pool of memory. As a result, your RAM has to serve the needs of both processing and graphics tasks.","For long-form feature film editing in Final Cut Pro, this has several implications:","Greater RAM demands: Feature films require handling high-resolution footage, multiple video tracks, complex effects, and color grading, among others. These tasks can put significant strain on your RAM.","Multitasking needs: If you are using other demanding apps alongside Final Cut Pro, such as other creative apps, your RAM needs will be even higher.","Importance of choosing the right Mac model: When buying an Apple Silicon Mac, you can't upgrade the RAM later, unlike with some previous Intel-based Mac models. So, it's important to consider your RAM needs upfront.","How Much RAM Do You Need?","As a baseline, Apple recommends a minimum of 8GB RAM for Final Cut Pro:","4GB of RAM (8GB recommended for 4K editing, 3D titles and 360° video editing)","However, for long-form feature film editing, you'll likely need more.","16GB RAM: This should be considered the minimum for professional work, such as editing feature films. It will allow for smooth editing of 4K footage and some flexibility for multitasking.","32GB RAM or higher: If you're working with 6K, 8K, or multiple streams of 4K video, or if you use lots of effects, consider 32GB or even 64GB of RAM. These larger RAM options will also provide greater flexibility for heavy multitasking and future-proof your setup as software demands increase over time.","At LateNite we're primarily using MacBook Pro's (2021 16-inch, Apple M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 3TB SSD), and they're rock solid.","While the unified memory architecture in Apple Silicon offers advantages such as increased efficiency and speed, it also places greater demands on your system's RAM. Therefore, when planning to use Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing on an Apple Silicon Mac, consider opting for at least 16GB of RAM, or even 32GB or 64GB for more complex projects and improved future-proofing. Remember, it's better to have a bit more RAM than you need, rather than not having enough when you need it most."]},{"l":"Understanding Drive Requirements","p":["An often underappreciated factor that can significantly impact your video editing workflow is the type of storage you use. When it comes to editing in Final Cut Pro, especially long-form feature film editing, opting for a Solid State Drive (SSD) over a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) can make a significant difference.","Choosing the Right Storage for Final Cut Pro: SSDs Over Spinning Disks:","External SSDs: High-capacity external SSDs have become increasingly affordable. They can be an excellent solution for expanding your storage space without having to replace your internal drive.","Faster Read/Write Speeds: SSDs offer dramatically faster data transfer rates compared to HDDs. This means that video files can be read, copied, and written much quicker, which is critical when dealing with large, high-resolution video files typical in feature film editing.","Greater Reliability: Because they have no moving parts, SSDs are less likely to suffer mechanical failures, making them more reliable than HDDs. This is critical when working on important projects like feature films, where data loss can be disastrous.","HDDs, or hard disk drives, are traditional storage devices that use mechanical, moving parts to read and write data. They are made up of spinning disks, hence the name \"spinning disks.\" HDDs are typically slower and less reliable (due to potential mechanical failure), but they usually offer more storage space for a lower price.","Improved Multitasking: SSDs are better at handling multiple tasks simultaneously, such as playing back multiple video streams, which is common in multicam editing or when working with complex timelines.","In 2023, you should definitely be removing slow spinning disks from your editing workflow entirely. (You might still choose to use them for backup.)","Manage Storage Space: SSDs typically have less space than HDDs. Be diligent about deleting rendered files, proxies, and other temporary files that Final Cut Pro generates during editing to free up space.","On the other hand, SSDs, or solid-state drives, are storage devices that use flash memory (similar to your smartphone or USB thumb drive) to store data. Because there are no moving parts, SSDs are significantly faster and more reliable than HDDs. However, they are also typically more expensive per gigabyte.","Practical Tips for Using SSDs with Final Cut Pro:","Quicker Rendering and Exporting: The faster speeds of SSDs also translate to quicker rendering and exporting times in Final Cut Pro. This is particularly important in a professional setting, where time is often of the essence.","The Advantages of SSDs for Final Cut Pro","Understanding HDDs vs SSDs:","While HDDs may be more cost-effective in terms of raw storage space, the speed, and reliability benefits offered by SSDs make them a superior choice for use with Final Cut Pro, especially for demanding tasks like long-form feature film editing.","While SSDs are clearly advantageous for video editing, it's important to use them strategically to balance performance and cost:","Working Drive: If you can't afford a large SSD, consider at least getting a smaller one to use as a 'working drive'. You can store your current project on the SSD for fast performance, then move finished projects to an HDD for long-term storage."]},{"l":"Storage Locations","p":["To keep library sizes as small as possible (which makes backing them up and sharing them easier), we always recommend keeping your media and cache external to the library.","Storing your media inside the library is an option for solo editors who do not work collaboratively, but external media offers more power and flexibility."]},{"l":"Library Organisation","p":["Each event in Final Cut Pro is its own Core Data database.","You can learn more about the library structure here.","Given this, we recommend splitting up your media into multiple events, rather than putting all your media in a single event powered by a single database.","We recommend using emojis in event names, to differentiate the list of events more clearly.","For example, this is from a 5 x 30min broadcast television special:","You can learn more about this workflow here.","Here's an example of a library for a job where all the user interface designs were build in Final Cut Pro for a game:","Here's an example of a library for a basic corporate edit:","If you're working on a very heavy feature film, your current feature length timeline should be in its own event."]},{"l":"Avoid Snapshots","p":["Snapshots are the devil. You're much better off using something like PostLab.","When you duplicate a project as a snapshot, Final Cut Pro embeds copies of compound or multicam “parent” clips in the duplicate, so any changes to other instances of those clips do not affect the duplicate.","Generally speaking, when you're working with a long-form project, all of your media is generally a Multicam Clip (because you're syncing with external audio) — so each time you create a Snapshot you're essentially creating a duplicate of all the clips metadata.","When you create a Snapshot, Final Cut Pro generates copies of your used clips and any connected clips, including titles, effects, compound clips, and multicam clips. All of these elements contribute to the overall size of the Snapshot.","While Snapshots can be a valuable tool for preserving your project's state at a specific point in time, excessive use can have a significant impact on your library size and performance. This can in turn affect Final Cut Pro's performance.","An overly large Final Cut Pro library can lead to several issues:","Reduced System Performance: A bloated library can slow down Final Cut Pro's performance, making it less responsive and lengthening render and export times.","Limited Storage Space: If your library size becomes excessively large, it can occupy a substantial portion of your available storage space. This can be particularly problematic if you're working with limited storage capacities, such as on a laptop with a small SSD.","Back-up Challenges: Large libraries can also be more challenging to back up, as they require more storage space and more time to copy to your backup drive."]},{"l":"Edit with Proxy Media","p":["Long-form editing, particularly at high resolutions (4K, 8K), can be quite demanding on system resources. To ensure a smooth editing experience, Final Cut Pro offers a 'proxy workflow'. This allows you to create lower-resolution versions (proxies) of your footage for editing. Once the editing is complete, you can easily switch back to the original high-resolution files for final output."]},{"l":"Use the Magnetic Timeline","p":["The Magnetic Timeline is one of the unique features of Final Cut Pro. It offers a trackless approach to editing, allowing clips to automatically slide into place and avoid clip collisions and sync problems. This is particularly useful in feature film editing, where you may be juggling hundreds or even thousands of clips."]},{"l":"Master Your Tools and Shortcuts","p":["Final Cut Pro offers a wide range of tools for tasks such as trimming, re-timing, and applying effects. Mastering these tools, along with the keyboard shortcuts for commonly used functions, can significantly speed up your editing process."]},{"i":"leverage-final-cut-pros-multicam-editing","l":"Leverage Final Cut Pro's Multicam Editing","p":["If your film includes footage from multiple cameras, Final Cut Pro's Multicam editing feature can be a major time-saver. It allows you to sync up to 64 angles of video footage using audio waveforms, timecode, or markers. Once synced, you can cut between angles in real time while watching the multicam viewer."]},{"i":"use-compound-clips-and-roles-for-organisation--efficiency","l":"Use Compound Clips and Roles for Organisation & Efficiency","p":["Compound Clips allow you to bundle separate clips together into a single clip, which can then be edited as one. This is useful for managing complex sequences or visual effects compositions.","Roles in Final Cut Pro allow you to label and organize different types of audio such as dialogue, effects, and music. When exporting, you can output multiple versions of your mix (such as stereo and surround) or a file with separated roles for further mixing or mastering."]},{"l":"Keep Regular Backups","p":["Given the scale and importance of feature film projects, it's essential to keep regular backups of your work. Final Cut Pro's built-in backup tool makes this process easy and automatic. Backups can be accessed from the File > Open Library > From Backup command, but they can also be found in the Finder, in Home > Movies > Final Cut Backups > LIBRARYNAME."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Final Cut Pro is a powerful tool for long-form feature film editing, but like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used. By adopting these best practices, you can ensure that your editing process is efficient, your workflow is smooth, and the end result is a feature film of professional quality. Remember, the key to successful film editing is a combination of technical skill, organization, creativity, and storytelling.","Want to contribute?

I now have all assets I need to proceed:","Fast forward to the interesting part of delivery preparation: The simple roles setup is enough to immediately export different assets such as clean-feed or M&E (music and effects) tracks.","Firstly, I of course finished the Director’s Cut, also known as ‘cinema version’. The original 23,98p UHD (4K 16:9) material was edited in a 2K flat 1998x1080 native 24p project (audio set to stereo). FCP working its magic already, the frame rate conform happens automatically and without hick-ups in the background. the extra resolution gave more details when scaled down and noise was reduced. I also had more room for stabilization, framing and ‘ken-burnsing’ that way.","Organization: As commonly done, I created events for corresponding steps in post-production. Through the use of ‘Folder Names as Keywords’ during import I could start editing right away because we took the time of naming folders when copying media to the source drive. I could easily find people, location and topics that way. My process now starts which is not using any typical media management methods besides favorite ranges or in/out points in the browser. I like to assemble groups of clips in the project with gaps in between to move parts around creatively.","Screenshot 1A","Screenshot 1A: The original 24p cinema timeline. Note the clearly assigned roles: For video there are two different types of archive material (different sources) which do not have any other purpose other than source referencing (aka ‘clippings’). The ‘Titles’ role includes all on-screen text like lower thirds, fullscreen inserts, credits or titles. For audio all elements are grouped as well with red being English narration (voice-over). The SRT track includes subtitles for all non-English dialogue.","Screenshot 1B","Screenshot 1B: The original 24p cinema timeline as its own project with audio lanes enabled.","Screenshot 2","Screenshot 2: Now with roles being set, the real power of FCP’s export (share) window comes into play. Switching to ‘Separate Files’ I exported the following: A ProRes HQ clean video file, aka ‘clean-feed’, which includes everything BUT titles (important for localizations of TV channels per on territory). Note that the ‘titles’ role is missing. And the most important part is audio tracks (or ‘stems’ in this case), which are created easily that way. I will end up with 4 files, 3 of which being audio, separated into: Speech (original dialogue and extra recorded narration/voice-over), Effects (all the ambience, atmospherics or SFX I placed manually or were recorded on location) and Music. Music & Effects are stereo tracks, Speech is mono, so a total of 6 channels. It should be clear now which purpose this will server a little later on: A rough, home-made 5.1 Surround up-mix from pure stereo sources for a better cinematic experience. Last but not least: All subtitles/captions as separate SRT files per language (English and German in my case).","Screenshot 3","Screenshot 3: In a new surround (!) project I assemble the just exported stereo audio files and use FCP’s unique and genius surround panner in the inspector (set to the respective purposes) as displayed in the next screenshots. Note: I also export a special M&E stereo track now, which is a combination of all sound effects/atmospherics and music, hence the name ‘music and effects’. TV needs this for dubbing their own language version. They would re-mix audio after adding their own voice-over and synchro. Same for surround. Tedious, I know, but necessary.","Screenshot 3A","Screenshot 3B","Screenshot 3C","Screenshot 4","Screenshot 4: In yet another project (still 2K flat 24p but set to surround) I copy&paste all titles on top of the re-imported clean-feed, which I also added the ‘Broadcast Safe’ effect set to standard ‘0’ to. I also re-import the captions and prepared audio files. Now I have full control over ‘versioning’, which means cinema or broadcast/streaming in ‘clean’ or ‘fixed’ English.","Screenshots 3A-C: The presets for Dialogue (tuned to 90), Ambience and Music delivery a solid, yet quick & dirty, way to create a 5.1 surround mix by spreading audio signals over all channels but keeping speech mainly in front (center speaker behind the cinema screen). Note: You need a separate voice/dialogue track for this, hence the before mentioned preparation. I would not recommend this (although it is possible and works OK) for just a single stereo mix – if you want to up-mix one single stereo mix, you should choose ‘create space’ as the preset instead.","Secondly, I knew in the end we need to conform to a 52 minutes TV version (Central-European broadcast standard length for docs) and to 25p (which happens by a 4% speed change - what has always been done since the invention of analogue TV), so I needed a 55 minutes for the cinema master in 24p (the FPS conform would take care of the length automatically due to speed up of 4%). To exactly hit 52 minutes I would just adjust the length of credits (scrolling speed) in the very end. For audio improvement I usually use Voice Isolation at 50% combined with the EQ set to ‘Tremble Boost’ – at least for our wireless Sony mics this gives crisp and clear speech.","Setup: The SDR library is located on the internal SSD as well as all cache files, library backups, export renders and transcodes. Nothing gets stored inside the library so that it stays small and fast. For the amount of 600 GB source media, the library clocks in at under 500 MB stat way. All source media is fed from an external RAID (HDD) or portable LaCie SSD.","SRT captions for subtitles (sidecar files)","Stereo mix of everything but also Stereo M&E","Surround mix of everything, but also Surround M&E","Thirdly, I made sure during editing that all roles get directly assigned to the right ones for audio and video alike, also all non-English dialogue (we had German and Kurdish besides the English narration) was translated on-the-go and out into a corresponding SRT captions track. From this point on, whatever I was doing and moving around would clearly be color-coded and ready to be filtered by the timeline index. Grading was done exclusively with the new native ‘Color Adjustment’ correction (plus some shape masks) which allow for easy highlight recovery. For sharpening I used the ‘High-pass Filter’ ported from Apple’s Motion (see bottom for details).","Video clean-feed with titles to be added in yet another project"]},{"l":"Versioning","p":["Checking the list from the beginning again, there are some special requirements for non-cinema releases. Namely R128 (audio) and R103 (video) normalizations. The latter we took care of with the ‘Broadcast Safe’ filter directly in FCP but sadly, Apple has not included audio mastering yet. Again, this task is covered by Davinci Resolve (this time ‘lite’ suffices) where you can normalize audio according to the most important standards via a right click on it in a timeline. So we have to re-import a final mix in R128 once again and put in our project. This is represented in Screenshot 4.","Cinema international version in 2K flat 1998x1080, 24p, 5.1 Surround as ProRes HQ master file with English titles and burnt-in English subtitles (captions).","For audio, I drop in the previously exported Stereo mixes (R128 and M&E) and manually speed-change them (FCP does not do this automatically for audio, which is a good thing!) by 4,1% (remember, the original FPS was 23,98 not native 24p, hence 0,1% more – yes, I know everything is super confusing). Audio should not be in complete sync and at the exact same length as video.","HDTV/VOD version in HD 16:9 (just change project settings for a different resolution), 24p with either Surround or Stereo + M&E as ProRes HQ, with or without titles and captions as separate files (note that there is also a CC track, meaning closed captions, aka SDH, in which also spoken English has been transcribed).","I can now deliver the following as listed in the very beginning:","Let’s not forget to, again, add the Broadcast Safe to the clean-feed to make it ‘legal’. We already know hot to proceed with exporting Multitrack Quicktime files. We are done and have exported several versions which usually takes a lot longer and additional people.","Note: You can either import CSV data into an Excel table (Google knows how to do it) or get the free ‘Table Tool’ on the Appstore to open CSV files easily.","Now comes the last, most tedious, step, which you might not need: The frame rate conversion to 25p for ex-PAL TV stations (in HD 16:9 and Stereo R128). Yet another project created, making sure it is set to 25p. Dropping in the clean-feed in 24p and FCP works its magic. It has already been conformed and speed-changed by 4% and is reduced in length because of it. I exported the Titles role as a separate video (from the 24p project) before in ProRes 4444, which includes an Alpha channel, meaning: Transparency. Why? Because now also the titles get speed-changed and are in sync without me adjusting every single title manually. I can still export another clean-feed, this time in 25p, this way. This is represented by the purple role in Screenshot 7.","Now use Save Timeline Index to CSV to receive a CSV file which you can use to create a MCS (music cue sheet) for royalty reports.","Remember the captions? The only thing not speed-changeable (why not, I ask, would be a neat feature) are the subtitles, so before we can import them here, we need them to be conformed to 25p too. Luckily there is a great free online tool for this purpose as shown in Screenshots 8a-b: https://editingtools.io/subtitles/(expand the ‘advanced’ options).","Screenshot 5A","Screenshot 5A: Using the unique Multitrack option during sharing again, it is easy to deliver a ProRes master file with 12 audio tracks, where tracks 1-6 are the full surround mix in R128 for example (assigned to ‘Dialogue’ role but you could create your own) and tracks 7-12 are surround M&E, meaning everything without speech for dubbing purposes and in full scale (not R128). Also, through removing or adding the ‘Titles’ role it is easy to create a clean-feed or localized English version. Again, cations are exported separately as sidecar SRT files, as shown at the bottom.","Screenshot 5B","Screenshot 5B: Same thing as 5a but now it is a project set to stereo with the corresponding mixes we created before hand from the original project and/or stems.","Screenshot 6A","Screenshot 6B","Screenshot 7","Screenshot 7: The clean-feed 24p assets (audio and video) in yet a new project, which is set to HD 25p for broadcast PAL conforming.

Usually a music cue sheet (MCS), a titles inserts list (TIL) and a full script of every spoken word for dubbing or localization (captioning). The latter we already have (kind of) with the above mentioned CC (SDH) SRT file – which I created by running a separated narration VO file (exported this one role) through the genius ‘MacWhisper’ app and combined the resulting SRT with the other one within the FCP captions. For the other two report docs we need all the timings (timecode) of both, text inserts and music cues.","UPDATE (1st Dec 2023): Seems like there is an easier and a lot more straightforward solution for cue sheets (music and titles) by using the fantastic companion app Producer’s Best Friend by Intelligent Assistance.

As David told me, the whole thing emerged from a circle of friends. And at the same time it's the cinema debut for many of the team. How did the beginnings of the script come about?","DANIEL: Well, I've known David much longer than Denis (Denis Moschitto, co-director and main cast). We shot the series \"Im Knast\" in 2015/16 and became close friends after the first season. I was ready to make my film debut. Denis wanted to work as a full-blown filmmaker and not \"only\" as an actor. And we figured we want to do this with David, not only as the guy who cuts everything together in the end. So we formed a gang of three - also as proof of concept of how we want to work. It wasn't like, \"Oh, we want to tell this practitioner's story.\" It was more about: how do we actually want to shoot (and produce a film) at all? We took a much more radical approach. The film had an internal working title. We called it: \"Let's fuck shit up!\". So, this freedom was really important to us from the get-go, not for reasons of protectionism, but to not be held back by some kind of structural corset. For example, we didn’t want to work closely with a post-house, rather we wanted to be in control of it ourselves; we wanted to do the exports without calling a technician or anxiously send out VFX lists only to have someone tell us it’s too expensive. We wanted to do it on our terms and with our particular skill-set. And that was at least as important as the story: to figure out our own process, like a personal framework for filmmaking. Is it possible to do it that way? And if so, then we'll cultivate that in the future.","FLORIAN: So you imagined an even more intense collaborative process as filmmaking already is? And you started with the key-positions of editing, acting and directing?","DANIEL: Yes, you could say that. You also have to say that Denis didn't want to play the lead role at first. He wanted to do the part behind the camera. But that ultimately changed during Covid19, I have to be honest.","DAVID: The pandemic changed the script as well.","DANIEL: Yeah, exactly, that opened a door.","DAVID: It inspired parts of the story that weren't there before. Probably the strongest storylines now.","FLORIAN: So I understand it like this: everyone brings their particular skills from a different direction and then you mingle together. And Denis brought his skills from the acting-side?","“ Some even say the Film Editor is like a second director. Denis recently called it shadow-directing. ”","DANIEL: Yes, basically that's right. And if I may say one more thing, which is really close to my heart; a really underestimated part of your (David and Florian’s) work is: Editing isn’t only connecting lines and securing continuity! If you do a somewhat decent job, you finish writing the script in the edit! And I think it's totally important not just to award credits, but, prospectively, understand it as the collective effort it already is. Some even say the Film Editor is like a second director. Denis recently called it shadow-directing. It's sometimes very difficult to distinguish: what is script, what is acting, what is camera, what is staging? And with editing, somehow nobody sees it unless it sucks. Or you win an Oscar, like in this Queen film, because you clearly saw how strong the interventions are there. Unfortunately, there's no real obvious traction for this, neither inside nor outside our line of work, that articulates how much these processes are interdependent and extremely interdisciplinary. And I also think that a lot of the work of directing on set is about opening up spaces for people to do their work well. That's always been a saying that we've had: you don't tell actors how to play it well, but you find people, through casting and all other processes, who work it out with you. And for us, Editing is simply part of that from the very beginning. That's the way it is for me from now on. With every larger project, it's simply an absolute must-have that the editing is there as early as it can be. That you simply talk about everything. So David was even present during prep for blocking the scenes. That all paid off. That's not the most efficient way of working as far as human life is concerned. Nevertheless, for me it’s the nucleus of an ideal shooting situation. To manage this in 30 shooting days, which have come to destroy you. (smiles) To pull that off, that’s killer!","FLORIAN: David, did you actually co-write or just read the script and comment on it?","DAVID: The latter. I’ve never had the script open in Final Draft in this case, but I had read everything since the first treatment draft and we talked about it afterwards. What works well, where do I have ideas for development? It was such a gritty learning process. I would also say that my initial comments were more like, \"yeah, it's all totally awesome, looks awesome, great, exactly.\" The closer the shoot, the more complex the exchange became. And I think that in follow-up projects we’re already noticing how this collaboration has changed and intensified.","FLORIAN: So, you're actually benefiting from this intense work during writing and pre-production. Are you actually getting faster? More precise?","DAVID: Several things. We knew the story and the characters so well that there were few questions left. We developed a lot, of course we'll get to that in a minute when we talk about principal shooting. But I think it's more that through this experience the degree to which I get involved in new projects is now much more intense. By how we've learned to communicate with each other about film, what we like, what works well, what direction we want to go. And also that we can imagine writing a script together. I mean, I would still have to prove that I can do that. But in the process of this film, we came so far that I don't think it would be an absurdity for all of us if that happens."]},{"l":"Workflow","p":["“ My motivation to work like this also came from my buddy Frido, who always used to select in Final Cut with the Playstation controller. He used to sit on the couch, in front of his client monitor, he does a lot of advertising and has a really fat client monitor, so he used to sit on the client couch and did selects with the controller. ”","DANIEL: And Reject, maybe, too.","DANIEL: Yeah, exactly, so since that (FCPX 2012) came out, I've cut everything I could with it. Obviously I haven't edited a feature film, but I've gained a lot of experience in terms of workflow stuff. And I've done a lot with it. And I loved it very quickly. The first version was really bad... but after they changed the library structure, it worked. Also, for David and me, a very important point was that we both had no desire to work on Avid and also had our experiences with Premiere. With Final Cut, you can just dig in and just work sensibly - cut \"from the gut\". And that's what I personally really wanted to do, because I know: You wipe over the footage, make a range, throw everything you find interesting in the timeline - snip, snap, snip - drag scenes to the left, to the right, to the left, to the right and then you're done....","DANIEL: You did, once.","DAVID: And Forward, Backward.","DAVID: And marked In/Out, favorite with the Playstation controller.","DAVID: And Reject still, yeah. And so then I watched and selected. Started editing in parallel as well, but it's a much more fluid and cohesive process.","DAVID: As I said, we wanted to do as much as possible ourselves. But of course, in order to have a certain security, just for insurance and stuff like that, there was still a post-production house involved. And that was WeFadeToGrey. The proxies were created there, then the proxies went to Victor (Rosario, Assistant Editor), and he synced everything. Then I took a walk to Victor's place, because it was very close, and picked up the footage on a hard drive, super oldschool, and if he was already done, also the Final Cut Library, or he sent it to me later.","DAVID: Exactly, yeah.","DAVID: I also created keywords for a few dialogs. But I discarded that relatively quickly, because there's just not that much talking in our film. (Laughter)","DAVID: Nah, actually it always stayed that way. And I didn't split the timeline into reels either, I just started and kind of kept going and when Final Cut slowed down I just reduced the library (deleted older timelines) and then everything rolled again smoothly. That way I didn't have the need to structure it differently. Admittedly, our workflow was really very low-tech in that respect. And, what we haven't said yet is that I hadn't worked on Final Cut once before.","DAVID: No, I had one event per shooting day and then sorted the scenes by keywords.","DAVID: Totally. Although our workflow and also the structure of the library was not ideal. But the pure editing, that went super fast, well off the cuff. Basically, I've never understood it if you only want to work with one technique or one software. Because first of all you’d limit yourself. And I think they all have their advantages and disadvantages. Final Cut is simply years ahead! But still, both Avid and Premiere have their justification. At btf, we worked on Premiere for all those years and it was perfect for one-shots that had a lot of graphics and VFX shots. It would have been unthinkable to work on Avid. And that was kind of the approach to learn the \"new hot shit\" as well. Of course, that started with the viewing and selecting, how much fun that is! Because otherwise, in Premiere or in Avid, with every new project, I'm actually always faced with such a conundrum first, that I have to decide how I want to watch and select now.","DAVID: Unlike with Avid or Premiere, I don't have to decide: do I just watch everything first? Do I do markers or a select sequence or do I start cutting directly and slowly work my way through the footage? When I'm working on Avid or Premiere, I usually do it in such a way that I start cutting right away and then go from the footage further into the structure, into the deep. With the way you can mark favorites in Final Cut, I've gone back to doing selects classically without feeling like it's costing me too much time, energy, and motivation. I feel like selecting with other NLEs, maybe that's fun, too. But when you're done you haven't done anything yet. (Laughter) You don't have that feeling with Final Cut. So: I marked my favorites, and then in the next step, in the View I already hid everything (note: show only Favorites in Browser) and with that I had my select reel in the Browser as a starting point. My motivation to work like this also came from my buddy Frido, who always used to select in Final Cut with the Playstation controller. He used to sit on the couch, in front of his client monitor, he does a lot of advertising and has a really fat client monitor, so he used to sit on the client couch and did selects with the controller.","DAVID: Well, I once assisted a friend (Frido Körner) on a commercial, with the approach \"I want to learn a little Final Cut\". I did rough cuts there, too, and mainly got the assistant stuff down, to understand how Final Cut works in the structure. Then I looked at your (Florian, German editor’s association internal) introduction again, in preparation for the film and then just jumped in at the deep end and started. Because Daniel knows Final Cut so well, I had no worries for the time after the shooting. And during shooting I could always call Frido if I had any questions...","DAVID: Well, once, I did once....","DAVID: Yes, from Stella Fachinger. I was also on the set for the first two days of shooting, and then we talked on the phone, and in the classic way there were Lockit files digital ScriptSuper-notes that Victor transferred into FCP).","Editing a feature film with Final Cut Pro","Event structure of the editing project","FLORIAN: And have there been notes from the ScriptSupervisor?","FLORIAN: And then there was one event per scene? Or did you do it via keywords?","FLORIAN: And with this Favorites-concept you went through the whole film? So it's not like you did extra keywords again? That would be my method: the favorites all get one keyword, then the favorites get suspended and I select favorites of that keyword (fine selection).","FLORIAN: He put the shortcuts on the controller?","FLORIAN: Okay, do you mind telling us briefly what the technical workflow was like, from the set to the editing room. And after that, we would look a little bit at how you actually worked dramaturgically on set. How were the proxies delivered to you and how were they created?","FLORIAN: Okay, let's start there. You get the first shooting day in for SCHOCK, and then: how do you select?","FLORIAN: Okay. And David, did it feel for you like that right away? All this throwing in and freestyle mixing clips, as Daniel describes the whole thing?","FLORIAN: Okay. Then you split it into reels yourself at some point, or scene-Events?","FLORIAN: Play, Pause, In/Out, Favorite, that's all you need.","FLORIAN: So it’s been ProRes proxies?","FLORIAN: Wait a minute, Daniel, but you've done a lot before, smaller projects?","FLORIAN: Wait, this is where it gets interesting.","FLORIAN: What do you mean not once?","FLORIAN: Yeah, exactly.

Then, when you're sitting in a café where it's a little bit louder, that's not such a good idea anymore. And relatively quickly we moved on to not discussing the previous day's dailies, but rather doing a kind of style critique. On the one hand, how the camera works and how we want to narrate cinematically with the camera, and on the other hand about the character development.","DANIEL: We did make some drastic decisions, it has to be said. For example, we changed the character who gets shot at the end in the showdown. That was originally a different person. And that evolved exactly from those conversations. David was telling Paul all the time, \"Dude, fuck the axis, go in, shoot sloppy, it doesn't matter, let go!\" And that totally triggered a lot. You really can't underestimate that. It was incredibly important. Yesterday, in a moment of madness, I looked at the version we shot - not one stone was left unturned, except for very important details. The film changed incredibly during principal filming. And that was totally cool, I would say. To always discuss with each other and to hold each other up. It was a constant comparison: here we are on the right track, there we have to put in more, there we give less. It's also a film that intentionally leaves out information in a lot of places, in a way that hopefully doesn't bother you. Without those conversations, we never would have been able to do it that way.","DAVID: Frustration management, too. The shoot was tough as nails. There were really few shooting days for what we had planned. And of course the guys were used up quickly. And I gave a lot of motivational speeches. Not because it didn't work. It was often about saying: we're on a good path!","DANIEL: Yes. With David, at the end of the day, it was another view from the outside. While I was already essentially the first viewer via the small monitor on set, David was the next first viewer.","FLORIAN: Yeah, logical. I can also feed back to you that, my impression after the premiere. Because I knew that David was there, I also tried to notice the editing and the mise-en-scene. In other words, I tried to watch actively, what I usually avoid at the first screening. And it's striking: the film is extremely varied! Longer camera movements, pans, montage-sequences, but also more classic blocking and also somewhat fancy camera angles. And still, the thing seems to be made of one piece. It just doesn't fall apart, but it makes the whole thing lively and exciting. And maybe that's also due to this process.","DANIEL: For sure.","DAVID: We didn't just talk about the footage, but also about the next day and what’s planned. And that's where we sometimes developed together, we said \"come on, this scene: one shot!\", or \"come on: two safety, but no shot-reverse-shot!\", just brave: something interlaced, or maybe a bit architectural... And these are then ultimately also the scenes where the shots could last very long (without a cut)."]},{"l":"Redefining the Genre","p":["Without negating the legacy","FLORIAN: The film manages to stay tough and serious. How hard was it for you not to drift into satire or coolness? And that maybe ties into what you guys were just talking about.","DANIEL: So it's a mixture of very easy and very, very, very difficult. When we decided to make a movie at that time, the idea came up, \"what about a gangster movie?\". And then we actually said, \"no, this coolness, somehow we're not up for it at all\". And that was, I think, a narrative demand that had been seething with us for so long that we couldn't get past it. We wanted to play with it. For example, Fahri (Yardim, supporting cast) is wearing a cool leather jacket and is looking grim, but in such a way that it doesn't tip over into a comic reality. That was actually a very simple decision. A film that nevertheless serves the genre, with a showdown, with a certain form of depiction of violence. That it has to be a bit borderline. Not a film that has to please everyone. It was ultimately about going a little bit to the extreme. For example: How little can you talk without thinking it’s a student film where the task was: you're not allowed to talk. So, getting the coolness out of it wasn't that hard. But a film that builds a coherent atmosphere and world within these 114 minutes, without classically learned mechanics, without a love interest, with a main character for whom you can't clearly say why he's actually acting like this. That was very, very difficult. And it took a lot of time.","“ How little can you talk without thinking it’s a student film where the task was: you're not allowed to talk. ”","FLORIAN: Cool gangster movies - there would be a lot of references. So there are pitfalls when you're staging it the opposite way and dealing with actors who are used to it differently. There's a lot for you to do on set, isn't there? Always holding them back a little bit or nudging it in a different direction.","DANIEL: Yeah, ..., we still have a few ADR parts in it that are a thorn in our side. That's why I watched the raw footage of a scene again. And I was totally surprised. It's the scene where Bruno is at Giuli's house for the first time and treats this wound. The scene is just forever long. The footage is forever. And Denis is acting with this medicine bag that was completely filled, like, 300 times in the movie. Incredibly hard to act shit. It's an awkward prop. Incredible number of times he has to open it, close it.","DAVID: Gloves always on, mask too.","DANIEL: The handling, the continuity - that wasn't the difficulty. It was the ability to remain calm. Not to go for efficiency in storytelling. Not to tell it like: now he's sitting with his sister, then he has to say \"sis\" three more times so that people understand.","DAVID: For the scene, we had a relatively steep idea for the character constellation in the days before (during the dailies-discussions). There's not much of that left in the result, but it led to quite a lot of nuances.","DANIEL: There used to be a different ending, it has to be said.","FLORIAN: They're hugging, aren't they?","DAVID: Exactly.","DANIEL: Actually, something else happened after the hug.","DAVID: Right. And also in between, some other stuff happened where the relationship between brother and sister gets a different conflict that we ended up leaving out, but it totally helped the buildup of the scene. Because a conflict arose between the three of them. That was then left out. But it still remained as a basic conflict in the constellation of the characters. And this development was totally exciting for us. A bit like a director's trick, but without being shitty to people, so that they reach their limits. Like throwing in an idea to push everyone to the brink. Coming back to the genre arc, what was really important for the shoot as well: to actually show a lot of things and to be explicit. Not to cut away in moments where it's about violence, or even the consequences of violence, or everything that's medical in the film. We wanted to be in these moments and absolutely show it. For example the treatment of the gunshot wound. How he pulls the thing off and you see the \"pizza\" (inflammation around the wound) and the hole. We have been so lucky with our make-up artists, Daniel Schröder and Annette Schirmer. It had to look good. He takes off the patch and you think \"oh shit, this fucking hole in the back\". Starting from there to the thumb at the end (of the film), we wanted to show everything. Not to cut away in those moments and only tell it with sound because it's easier. Sound also works, because it hurts associatively. But we wanted to show it all, as statements of intent to the genre.","DANIEL: Immanence, that was a total buzzword for us when we were shooting. We tried to hold it up everywhere we could. For the genre. To somehow get pressure into it. Meaning: real shots, real locations, no car rides in LED hell. And above all, to let actors play and not only shoot for the edit."]},{"i":"creative-struggles--frustration-management","l":"Creative Struggles & Frustration Management","p":["_“ Final Cut invites you to go on forever: fade here, something there, jab jab, while it is running (!), ... ”","DANIEL: Exactly, the letting go, even of frustrations from the set. We had that with two or three other scenes that took a little bit in the edit to get done. At some point, one of us said, \"Nah, come on, let's do it. We'll take out the montage-sequence and we'll go through it properly, again.\" I mean, you know for yourself when you're sitting in the edit and suddenly the knot unravels. And you know you’ll just need three frames here, a different setting there, and maybe a little bit of a different mindset ... We also had a small, very early test screening with Rainer Nigrelli and Flo Böttger. Watching it with different eyes has also totally changed a lot for us. And for David it was just stress, because there are two guys sitting behind him and say, \"Get in early.\" - \"No, out earlier.\" - \"Boom, there's music.\" - \"Nah, without music.\". That was really super untechnical. That's why, I think, we haven’t had real conflict, except for general frustration management. But there was a long phase, also during editing, where we had no idea whether the film would work. I think we were really afraid that we would cut it and then it would just completely suck.","DANIEL: I got two, three things. David?","DANIEL: I think 30 days in total. I remembered 18 weeks of editing.","DANIEL: That was surprising. That was really surprising.","DANIEL: Totally. It's totally crucial. I've also suffered a lot in Premiere and Avid. More in Premiere, even less in Avid. I really think: getting access to the footage, so you just have a visual reference of what you're working on, that's easy in Final Cut - I can’t understand why you wouldn't want that in editing. I really don’t fathom.","DANIEL: Vape, vape, vape ... I picked up the mouse every once in a while. I really like seeing the timeline to get a feel for what's happening. And what I find so nice about Final Cut is that you can just let it run, trim another clip while it's running, turn the music down a bit, you can just march through. Even Denis felt the vibe that you can just march and “massage” the footage as you like. We actually took moments now and then to get away from the computer and watch it on a TV-Set. Because Final Cut invites you to go on forever: fade here, something there, jab jab, while it is running (!), and so constantly the attention is gone. But I don't think I'm a better editor than David, on the contrary. I'm just a bit more into technical shit, whereas David is more into \"I'll edit the scene nice and tidy\". If there's a new Voice Isolation thing in there, I immediately want to know how it works. Where the limits of it are and where they aren't. David just doesn't give a shit. So I was doing more of an editing assist, if you will.","DANIEL: We thought that was going to happen, but it didn't.","DANIEL: Yes, it could be that I did that once. It wasn’t the usual \"there's a director sitting around\". We always sat behind David, jerking around like dudes, which had to be annoying sometimes, right?","DAVID: 18 weeks of editing, but that was including principal shooting. We were together the whole time. And just fought our way through. It was an incredibly intense process. But at the same time, you have to say, we had no single night shift. Not on any day.","DAVID: 18 weeks was all right. We always said to ourselves, if it takes longer: screw it. We had an extremely low budget and we made super little money on the film. But because it was all of our big screen debut, we didn't give a shit.","DAVID: Exactly, and there again, this whole process is totally awesome that we wrestled for this scene so much and it changed for the better.","DAVID: Exactly, we thought it was going to happen. Sometimes I like that, too, as a certain protection mechanism. If I don't happen to know the director or producer that well yet, then maybe I’d like to have time alone to try something out and not have someone sitting behind me. With Daniel and Denis, there were no such insecurities or fears, for sure. But of course, when you're three guys... How many weeks did you shoot, Daniel?","DAVID: For example, we cut out the death of the character Naimee, the prostitute, very early. And built it so that that strand basically ends loosely for Bruno. After she’s got the sepsis and then an allergic reaction, it just got better again and he doesn't hear anything of her anymore. Particularly Denis and I favored that for a very long time. In the end, it's always a bit theoretical. You kind of have an idea to tell it differently and think: that's okay, it didn’t have as much impact as we thought it might anyways. Naturally, that's the easy way to get rid of it. And that's where Daniel really pissed us off, in a positive sense. He \"beat us up\" to not leave it like that and to give up. And I also think my ethos developed a lot during that time. As an editor, you probably don't want to admit that, but of course sometimes the path of least resistance is a grateful one.","DAVID: Nah, I don't think so. I think during that time there was an update with Dupe Detection. That was great. Because that was totally missing. Then all of a sudden it was there. And it was like \"Thank you!\".","DAVID: Right, and I'm not very interested in that.","DAVID: That was very surprising. Because Daniel and I are geared to spend the whole night. Maybe we were there until 10 p.m., but then the last two hours were mostly talking.","DAVID: Vaping noises, behind me all day.","DAVID: We had a rough cut of, I think, 2:45 hours. The first days were a bit wild … aftermath of the wrapping party. And then we really just sat together every day. So I don't remember any situation where we discussed something, now they're going to leave, we'll talk more tomorrow and I’ll execute.","DAVID: Yes, and I think with me it derives from \"learned stress\" from other projects. I had to unlearn that, in a way. We're editing together again at the moment. Daniel can say \"yes, let's have another look\", as often as he likes - I'm rarely annoyed. Except maybe when I'm tired, the dog is barking and I'm hungry and I think to myself, \"now leave me alone!\" The three of us have had a lot of things to deal with, I guess. Even Denis, who has never sat in the edit so intensely. I mean, with three people, if there's a disagreement, then it's two against one. There's no other way. And of course you’ll get annoyed sometimes. But in the end we all mastered these challenges, even if it took a little while. Denis is also happy now that Naimee's death is still in there. And I also like the way we approached the scene in the edit and with elliptical storytelling. How Bruno sits there and is desperate about what happened. That's how it became a strong scene. Not an action sequence of \"will he manage to save her?\". He arrives, she's already dead, and through our editing his desperation becomes very clear and relatable.","FLORIAN: And the Voice Isolation came with the same update, I think.","FLORIAN: Bitter reality.","FLORIAN: Daniel, can I just ask, with your Final Cut background, were there moments where you said, “let me do it myself”? Did you also sometimes, maybe for the better, push the keyboard over to each other?","FLORIAN: I think it’s great.","FLORIAN: My experience is almost the other way around, that I always say, \"I know you don't like it, but I'll remind you in two days, that maybe we should cut it out.\" Here the director is fighting obtrusively for something? But I guess it makes sense in your collective construct?","FLORIAN: The filmstrip view and how visually Final Cut presents everything, even to a bystander, is helpful to your work.","FLORIAN: We agree on that. Were there certain challenges in this fine-cutting phase, where you struggled and fought or where it just took longer and you were able to solve them?","FLORIAN: Yeah, cool. Let's go into your fine editing phase then. David, you had Denis and Daniel sitting there all the time - or did you send them out of the studio sometimes?","FLORIAN: Yeah, that’s in every process, usually after three weeks of fine editing or so. I would now slowly shift towards post and then wrap the whole thing. Maybe a little question about Final Cut: Did you miss something essential in the whole process? Or where you guys said, \"Gee, that feature would actually be good.\"","FLORIAN: You haven’t been so limited in time. For a TV movie you have to be done after 10 weeks.","Picture Lock Timeline with Playouts and Burnins above"]},{"l":"Post Production","p":["Delivering with Final Cut Pro","DANIEL: Yeah, it's awesome. I think during the edit itself - no complaints. Since I also did VFX, I took over the project technically after editing. And there are a few things during the handovers. For example, I would like to be able to lock the cut. That you can kind of say, Primary Storyline: no more timing change. That would be nice, for example. And sometimes it's a bit annoying that metadata in the Event and Timeline don't stay in sync. For example, if you create a Role for a VFX-source, that is not reflected in the Event, e. g. as a keyword-range. The information is only in the timeline. We had VFX shots marked with their own Roles to get them out as sources for VFX. I just did the math again. 71 fullblown VFX shots, but in reality it was more like 90. And that's not counting stabilizations. Because I did it all myself it was quite a lot of stuff. Then, of course, like I think a lot of people, we also had problems with stabilization, one should just be able to rebuild them 1-1 on other workstations, I think. And timecode... Or is that solved now? There is this timecode window. Is it possible to display the different tracks? I still don't think so.","FLORIAN: Well, you can display it, but you can't burn it in.","DANIEL: Exactly. That's also really annoying, for example, that you can't do proper burn-ins. That would be really nice for a professional workflow, when you send it out to sound-post. So I brought the stuff into Resolve and made burn-ins there, then brought it back into Final Cut. It always takes time.","FLORIAN: Well, there are workarounds inside FCP for these problems, but it could be better. And what was the point with stabilizing? So it wasn't the same on one computer as it was on the other?","DANIEL: No, that worked. But at some point it was like, you do a stabilization and everything is good. If you open it up on another computer, the analyzing never stops (note.: is constantly re-rendering). And the still frame is different from the moving picture. Feels a little wonky, I'd say.","FLORIAN: It would actually need some kind of render lock for one clip. That's what Alex4D once suggested.","“ I also think that you can't design sound as beautifully in almost any other tool as you can in Final Cut. It's an incredibly cool sound tool! ”","DANIEL: Exactly. At least some kind of rebuild function for the internal effects, which are otherwise great. And of course a render lock would be great as well. I think those are the few things I can think of right now. I also think audio lanes are great. I'm very happy about that. I also think that you can't design sound as beautifully in almost any other tool as you can in Final Cut. It's an incredibly cool sound tool! And that's super important to all of us. We worked on sound a lot and very precisely. So it's a shame - but this is a ProTools issue - when you put so much work into details that then all goes down the drain in transfers. I think that's really sad. If I still had time to learn programming somehow, I would do everything I could to get the sound in the studio to be exactly the same as it is in the edit. And also this \"In Avid, a lot of people only edit with mix-tracks\"-paradigm, that you don't really care about the sound in the edit, that bothers me.","FLORIAN: So, when you think about the deliveries now, David, you just handed it over to Daniel? And although you onlined it at WeFadeToGrey you still did the VFX and even the grading?","DANIEL: Exactly.","FLORIAN: But in Resolve probably.","Audio Lanes View of final edit"]},{"i":"pre-gradinghome-office","l":"pre-grading@home-office","p":["DANIEL: Exactly. The film got proper grading after all. And of course, that's only possible because I did a relatively intensive pre-grading. I built myself a nice little grading box in the office with black styros. With my Mac Studio and a 4K-DCI Eizo monitor, which I calibrated to 709. Then in Resolve I worked in full resolution in DaVinci wide gamut/intermediate, which is the RCM-2 color space, a color managed workflow. So I prepared grading on my 709 monitor and cut in all the VFX, then I could just switch to P3D65 to prepare it for the grading cinema. So that process worked extremely well if you ask me.","FLORIAN: Kind of like ACES, right?","DANIEL: So when ACES came out, I was always working in ACES. And when RCM-2 was released from Blackmagic, and the new HDR grading tools ... that is, I think, from the usability so fine, so nice to work with, I find ACES in comparison a bit ... sharper, feels more brutal somehow. I think (as a director) it makes much more sense to colorize your own film than to edit it. You can quickly change things radically. And develop a taste and build and try things out. Long story short, it's been a bit low-tech of course that I did it here in my office but then we moved to WeFadeToGrey and had the total opposite there in the grading cinema. That's kind of where the magic is for me. And what we haven't even said yet: We shot with the Sony Venice on full frame Cooke lenses, all 3:2 open gate in RAW (X-OC-XT), so 2:1 anamorphic 6K. Which is a quasi-12K image (de-stretched) or 12096x4032. But the finish was in 4K. WeFadeToGrey helped us a lot, especially Swen Linde supported us very well. We can only be very grateful. I don't think you could have done much more deluxe in Cologne. They were major supporters of us.","DAVID: Exactly, even though we wanted to do a lot ourselves, they really helped us out a lot.","FLORIAN: And this high resolution, of course it helps with VFX, as well as in editing, when you want to zoom a little further into the frame. I assume that you also used that more often.","DAVID: Yes.","DANIEL: Yes"]},{"i":"director--vfx-artist","l":"Director = VFX-artist?","p":["FLORIAN: Okay. I think now we should, but I'm still interested in the VFX workflow, briefly. So did you do those in Resolve or did you send them back to Final Cut?","DANIEL: Well, I did the onlining in Resolve. You have to know, during film school, I already had gathered experience in title design, grading and VFX-stuff for family and friends. My secret, technical post-production life, so to say. (smiles) So I did the VFX partly in After Effects, partly in Fusion. We don't have any 3D composites in it. But I always sent everything back into Final Cut easily via fcpxml, so that we could make clean playouts and sound transfers \"offline\" with the 2K proxies. We also re-delivered if anything was needed, or looked for another take. The Final Cut project was still in use during that process.","FLORIAN: Okay, okay, okay.","DAVID: Maybe a mini remark about the VFX. We just really had an endless number of retouches.","FLORIAN: Removals, retouches, split screens.","DAVID: Split screens and also really complex split screens, sometimes with two or three other retouching layers.","FLORIAN: Especially because of the handheld camera every single plate has to be tracked before comping, probably a bit tricky.","DAVID: Exactly, and therefore mostly zoomed in a bit. So it's not an uncomplex thing that Daniel did there. Which was just cool, briefly back to the editing process, because we were just never in the situation of having to think about whether it can be paid. We just did what we wanted to do in the end. Denis and I rather tried to hold Daniel back and say, hey, can't we not kill this VFX-shot, because you know what else you have to do.","FLORIAN: Daniel, how long did it take?","DANIEL: Yeah, a long time. I think three, four weeks at least. It was really crazy. But it was also cool. It was glamorous. Almost all the tracking stuff I did with Mocha because I did a lot of rotoscoping stuff with it as well and I just really like using Mocha. Also the performance with these 6K, de-stretched, was relatively good. I mean, I don't even want to pretend it had good performance when it comes to that kind of footage. It was overwhelming. A violent footage tornado that ran through my equipment. I worked with Mocha Pro. It was super awesome, I have to say. But then I had some problems with Mocha. There's a relatively new surface tracker in the Pro version that you can use to track organic stuff. It always crashed. And then I wrote back and forth with Boris FX support several times a day for a week, I think. It was a very intensive exchange. And that was really cool, how they took care of it. I thought that was totally great.","FLORIAN: Because it was so fresh on the M1, probably."]},{"l":"Working with Independent Developers","p":["“ Technically, I found that going through this process with Final Cut was incredibly convenient. Even the re-delivery process was very relaxed. If you document it thoughtfully! And if there's one tool that invites you to do that, it's Final Cut. ”","DANIEL: I have one last thing. And I'll make this real quick. What was so cool for us was when our producers and everybody said we're going to go back into the mix and we're going to re-cut. That everyone worked together like that. With EDLX, I pushed out EDLs for reconforming and created changelists with \"Change List X\". With reference audio because we cut with stems and only brought in original audio where there were changes. I provided the Soundpost with a small flood of deliveries and that worked super well. So don't be afraid to change things afterwards. It's not like we changed every other frame now, it was much more selective. We added one more scene, took one out, changed a few timings and tried to relax so that we didn't have to go into the whole process again. In the process, two or three VFX shots were created and I did the conforming in Resolve, I bounced the transfers back to our audio post, which worked really well. And I have to say, a little bit of “new school filmmaking” is that you don't let technical shit like that stop you. That just because you have a Picture-Lock planned, you're not going to change anything anymore. It's important, of course, that you do it reasonably and don't, like a maniac, say, “I'm not going to stop editing the film”. Technically, I found that going through this process with Final Cut was incredibly convenient. Even the re-delivery process was very relaxed. If you document it thoughtfully! And if there's one tool that invites you to do that, it's Final Cut. You get lists beaten out of there, technical solutions via Resolve and other tools... you can do things that are otherwise very difficult.","DANIEL: I think they were a bit keen on it, but they also saw, I think, that I do comparatively complex tracking stuff that you have to get to grips with somehow. But I was totally accepted by them. They sent me an alpha version early on so that I could work here. And that was just totally awesome, I thought. It was like a little nerd convention, over email and a little bit of chat, just solving problems with each other. So, you know, the nice thing was that I didn't really have a deadline. It wasn't like, fuck, now I've lost three days with some technical problem and I have to hustle through it so that I can keep to my timing. And I had a short contact with the X2Pro people, Marquis Broadcast. They also helped a lot to identify the problem in the first place. For example, we were talking about 32-bit audio. I think they've got a handle on all that in the meantime. (edit: yes. Fixed in 4.5.16) And that was just great that someone could make a reasonable statement. That you don't somehow only look for the error in yourself and don't understand why there is only noise in ProTools.","DANIEL: I worked with that as well. Yeah, that was great. So I did all the VFX lists with Producers Best Friend. Absolutely awesome. Even with thumbnails! If I had done that by hand, I would have been on it for a week.","DANIEL: Probably.

This was all tracked using a Google Sheet with the shots available to the whole team via Box.","As the edit started to come together, I’d share my thoughts with Mike and the producer who would look at WIP edits and communicate notes back to the animators based on shots that may need some minor tweaks to help the edit. It might be a frame here and there or (very occasionally) a whole rethink, but due to time restraints, we’d often have to compromise, focusing on what served the story and what was achievable in the time and with the resources we had at our disposal.","Being from a live action background, this was a different workflow for me. During pre-production, Mike would board each episode and build an animatic in Storyboard Pro which had a voice scratch track that Mike would produce himself, along with basic sound design elements and some music tracks for reference.","Below you’ll see my basic library setup for the project. The Library title was unfortunately auto generated by PostLab so the naming convention is a bit funky. A while ago, Chris Hocking who is the head of post at LateNite introduced using emojis in our Event & Folder naming structures. Although a simple thing, I’ve found this to be useful in identifying folders and events quickly and efficiently, particularly when you’re under the pump. Sometimes it’s the little things that help to keep a workflow moving.","Due to the pace in which we were working, and with multiple animators across each episode, there would occasionally be minor slip ups with the colour of a prop or a missing design element as we cut from a wide to a tight. In this instance, if we could we’d do a quick fix we would, rather than having to go back to the animator who might’ve already moved on to the next episode.","For post, we set up the project in PostLab so we could utilise the collaboration tools it offered. We encountered a few issues, with some work lost when uploading changes, however the terrible internet in Melbourne could have equally been to blame. As mentioned, the animatics for the series were produced in Storyboard Pro, from which we could export Final Cut Pro XML (.xml) files, along with any rendered visuals separated by panels. Using SendToX, I then produced a timeline with cut points along with Mike’s temp audio work. This was essentially my starting point.","Hi! I'm Kevin, the editor of The Future of Everything, a 2D animated anthology comedy series created by writer/director Mike Greaney.","If we got stuck, we’d occasionally have to pull some tricks, like repeating frames or holding frames to get the frame or two required to fix our issues.","Once I got into the edit, I would use Mike’s animatic for timing, to spot any unwanted changes that may have occurred during the migration, and to spot missing shots that may have gone unallocated or missed by the team. On episode one, I would sometimes use the .xml from the animatics to do scene detection in DaVinci Resolve, however I found that the exports from Storyboard Pro were reliable, so I abandoned this step pretty early on.","Once we had what we’ll call our first assembly edit in place with our completed shots, I’d look at the rhythm of each shot in the context of the edit, and start building a more robust sound design from the animatic.","Once we locked our edit - we’d then turn over our temp sound and music to the designer and composer respectively. On this job we were fortunate that Dead on Sound handled both. We’d export an AAF with X2Pro, with settings to discard any inactive or disabled audio. We’d also embed the audio with eight-second handles. When the mixes and stems came back as .wav files, it was just a matter of adding them as connected clips, assigning a new role, and disabling all other audio roles.","One area where live action differs from animation, is that the animatic is where you get your timing and ‘edit’ right before you start animating. Our focus during this period was sharing notes between the team on Frame.io and finessing the animatic so that by the time we entered the edit, there were really only minor tweaks required to reach our final locked off master.","That first episode was about setting up how our workflow was going to function, so there was a bit or trial and error involved, but once we found something that worked for our post team, as well as Mike and the producers, we stuck to it for the remainder of the series.","This Post-it note on top is my first prop design debut, helping to fix a continuity problem.","To finish with an interesting aside - we found that the episodes with less dialogue and narration tended to be the ones that required more tweaks, as the pacing tended to be more dictated by the animation rather than sound. Not hugely relevant to our workflow, but interesting none the less!","With the first twelve shots that I received, I exported ProRes 4444 from Adobe Animate and then imported them into keyword collections, that were organised by date, in the Animations Event I’d created. This became my process, eventually welcoming all 51 shots into my timeline for episode one. As mentioned, I used the .xml to help me lineup shots for timing, and would export weekly WIP edits for Mike and the producers to review."]},{"l":"Watch Series"},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"der-schatten-the-shadow","l":"Der Schatten (The Shadow)","p":["Case Study for a Mystery Thriller Series"]},{"l":"The Story","p":["A young journalist, Norah, moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new job.

These little chunks are reordered so that you can watch every similar part of every take in succession. In this way you can quickly compare every angle and find the best shot or dialogue.","Shortly before our production started Chris Hocking had the Titles to Keywords feature for CommandPost ready (commissioned by Knut Hake) and it rendered my old workflow obsolet. Before, we would tag every Sync Clip in the Browser with keywords. Even with dedicated shortcuts and scripting it was not an easy task. If you made a mistake and had to go back one step you could loose orientation. Now, we can complete the entire process within a timeline and with titles and we can also adjust each step throughout the process.","As you can see below its as easy as:","Create a title with dedicated name (e.g. part 01)","Copy it over to the next take, adjust length, and so on","then you send it to Titles to Keywords and are presented with an Event, where all takes are thoroughly tagged with a keyword for every part , which you can then rename with more information, if needed. (screenshot further down below)","This process even works with Multicams and stacked Sync Clips (multiple cameras layered in sync with TC).","Timeline with all takes in a row. above it titles with different lenghts are placed on the clips","finished Event, one keyword is selected. one short line in each take is highlighted yellow to demonstrate the ability to find a moment in the take very fast","For the sake of efficiency my approach is to not have every line, but 2-3 lines (around 20-25 seconds) in one keyword. This is small enough to have good orientation and, at the same time, not too many keywords, which also can be distracting. Depending on the length of the scene, we would have 5-9 keywords for our \"parts\"-system. The new process takes around than 20 minutes per scene, compared to the old approach, which could take up to 1 hour. The result is something like what's shown in the picture above: When you click on the keyword, which has parts of dialogue or a description of the moment in the name, you can quickly find the line you're looking for (circled in yellow). With the skimmer, it's a matter of milliseconds to play them in succession, select one, and exchange it with the take in the timeline. I also use this for the initial selection process in longer scenes. This is an excellent way to compare different takes on a macro-level."]},{"l":"Deliveries","p":["After Picture Lock we sent:","FCPXML to DaVinci Resolve for Color Grading and VFX","AAF via X2Pro to Sound Design and Music (if the timelines are well maintained beforehand sound-designers will be happy)","Lists for ADR, DI, VFX, Motion Design and Music via Producers Best Friend"]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Even though we edited in three different places simultaneously and moved to Berlin in the middle of the production everything went fairly smooth.","CommandPost s Title to Keywords sped up the AE-workflow significantly.","Final Cut and PostLab enabled us to concentrate on the creative work and even jump between episodes to build a compelling story.","The visuality of the Browser, the Magnetic Timeline and the overall efficiency of Final Cut Pro provide us with the necessary tools to be creative, even in time-demanding scenarios."]},{"l":"About the Author","p":["After his studies of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany, Florian Duffe started as an Assistant Editor in feature films (Hell, FCP 7, 2010, Finsterworld, Avid MC, 2013).","He made his debut as main Editor with Luna (FCPX, 2015) and has since cut several Movies (Tatort) and Series for national Television, most of them in Final Cut Pro.","In 2020 he was credited Associate Editor at the team of dystopian Sci-Fi-Thriller The Colony (FCPX, Director: Tim Fehlbaum, Editor: Andreas Menn).","Follow Florian here:","Twitter","Mastodon"]},{"l":"Poster"},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"indias-space-odyssey","l":"India’s Space Odyssey","p":["India’s Space Odyssey, the science documentary produced by Miditech Studios for Warner Bros.

I am a Producer-Director and Editor based in New Delhi, India. I collaborate on independent projects while also running my own creative production company called The Qurious Studio. I am the Editor on the Discovery+ India science documentary India’s Space Odyssey. It bagged the award for Best Current Affairs programme for a single Asian market at the Content Asia Awards.","I have used FCP X since its inception in 2011, while we were still working on FCP 7 and I have been a FCPX user ever since FCP 7. The transition from FCP 7 to FCPX was fairly smooth for me, however it was not the same story out there. For most editors the change was overwhelming, particularly the Producers and Production companies became extremely hesitant towards editing on FCPX. And with FCP7 dissolving, premiere occupied most of its space.","So, when I was asked to edit Space Odyssey, like a disclaimer, I had to tell them I edit on FCPX and if that is cool. Now, FCPX has to not just struggle with lack of information on it but also misinformation in the popular circle. I addressed few of their concerns holding my ground with confidence and then I believe they did not had much of a choice given the pandemic as well, so they gave it a nod.","India’s Space Odyssey is the story of the Indian Space Program that goes six decades back to as early as 1962 and before. That meant there was going to be a plethora of data to be managed, while we edit. A lot of which has to be archival footage, in all kinds of files and formats and the last thing to be shoot data. Like I remember the first batch of data, about 20 GB, sourced from NASA archives was eventually never used. All that clubbed with the data, Pria who produced and directed, and her team, shooting remotely in different parts of the world, would also come to my edit studio as they happen.","So I could anticipate much in advance that the core need on this project would be to have a robust data management within FCPX and outside as well. I took some time before the data could start coming in to do some homework on organising and structuring data, in order to follow a process that helps me when the project grows up to be complex. For this specific process demand, I could bring everything to work from keyword collections, smart collections to notes and metadata. Further I spoke to a few seniors but mostly wanted to peek into any pro editors process. Looking around YouTube, I feel most fcpx tuts/videos are often created in context to YouTube content only and there’s limited resources on YouTube for Pro editors. But I did find some help, one of the helpful videos I easily recall was from This Guy Edits, that helped look around the process of an editor to a Academy Nominated Doc. In conclusion, I think by end of project nothing else proved more crucial than doing that homework on organising and building a process to manage data because I never missed or struggled to find a file till the project finished.","Outside FCPX, I had used a drive cloning application to make an automated clone of the drive I was working on every few hours, since I was editing from my home studio and there were no RAID Storages.","Further, I had introduced Frame.io to the production team, since review and feedback were in question as I insisted on editing at my home studio and did not wanted to edit at a rental studio given my COVID-19 precautions/reservations. At the end Frame.io just didn’t turn out to be a saviour but it was so well received that it was further used by the production team on their other projects as well.","In terms of editing, I was editing on a 2017 27-inch iMac with 24GB RAM and an external monitor and I’ve never had a considerable hiccup with regards to FCPX’s performance and stability. It is one of those reasons that I had never left FCPX for, it is safe, stable and unbothering. Good organising, optimising legacy formats, keeping ample space in drives, managing volumes of render files, using Video-Audio roles from scratch, easy multicam syncing-editing and good old cutting were some key highlights to my workflow. Additionally, the documentary, perhaps due to budget constraints, was also colour corrected and graded in FCPX mostly using default tools. All in all, I could simply focus much more on the creative aspect of edit and lesser on the technical requirements once correctly setup. The FCPX workflow allowed me to have the headspace to discuss the edit creatively with my director and address creative concerns.","That said, there were still some genuine questions during the project, some answered and some had to be taken outside FCPX for help. Those addressed were like when exporting master the Discovery specification required a .mxf (OP1a) and I had to dig internet to learn and satisfy my director, that FCPX’s MXF export is by default wrapped in OP1a format. Others that did not find an answer were like the LKFS parameter, for which I could not find a solution within FCPX and I had to take my export file to Premiere Pro which had a LKFS meter.","Beyond performance and stability, I also use FCPX because I find the interface design much less intimidating and chaotic as compared to its contemporaries. The only complain is that there’s much less confidence in the industry on FCPX. And since I do not edit on any other NLE, I am turned down on many many more gigs compared to the numbers I am accepted on. Apple too seem to not take it with much seriousness as they do to their other products.

Accordingly, the church was the main reason why we chose Vysluní as the location.","Netflix was the gamechanger for me.

Working on large libraries requires a lot of up- and downloading which were constrained by our internet bandwidth. I setup a PostLab Local server on a M1 Mac mini which greatly reduced upload times (down to around 60 secs from previously 10-15 mins). The instructions to setup a Local server can be found in the Hedge documentation and we were able to set it up in 2 days without any prior knowledge of GitLab. For additional security we implemented Tailscale (Wireguard VPN) to restrict access to the server, which also allows us to access libraries remotely.","We considered a Jellyfish NAS for our media management, but couldn't justify the cost for our 2-person studio. PostLab Drive is a great tool for working remotely, but it still requires all media to be uploaded to their server. We were looking for a similar tool that would keep our media in sync which lead me to Syncthing. It allows you to sync directly over your local ethernet network, but also syncs peer-to-peer over WAN access. For additional security these connections are also running through Tailscale. This setup allows us to be very mobile and we solely work off OWC Envoy Pro SX 4TB drives which are super-fast and rugged. In addition we keep daily backups on two OWC ThunderBay Flex 8 drives.","Before shooting started we talked with our post-production supervisor, sound recordist, script supervisor, camera department and DIT on set to align our workflows.","We discuss editing codecs and naming of media files.

F* ck you, I do that too!","Well, yes, I decide to develop my application anyway and focus it on a different, probably fuller workflow than Macwhisper's, and I start testing with Whisper's Large model, made available in open source by the people who created it: OpenAI, yes, the same people as ChatGPT."]},{"i":"why-chatgpt","l":"Why ChatGPT?","p":["Let's make a nice technical digression, since we're here among friends, pretend we're in a pub, and we've made it to the third round of beer, only instead of talking about soccer or some other sport, we're nerdy enough to get excited about something technological...","So why is Whisper so important? And what ties it to ChatGPT? I will try to explain things in a simple and certainly inaccurate way, so those who understand a little about artificial intelligence, plug their ears...","Whisper is a transformer, and while Siri, Alexia, and Google try to understand the word or phrase that was spoken, Whisper goes a little bit wide and also tries to understand the context of each phoneme, and through a very broad knowledge base as well as statistical calculations, tries to make each word follow the word that makes the most sense, consistent with what is being spoken.","Whisper's wide model takes up a good 3GB, a little more in memory when it runs, but it is still to be considered a \"basic\" model, probably ChatGPT four is at least 100 times bigger - which is why it will be difficult to run something like this on our computers.","Rose-water technical details aside, this is one explanation of why Whisper is so much more accurate and also succeeds where other transcription systems stall: in the unfortunate event that it does not understand a word or part of a word, it \"reconstructs\" it from what comes before and what comes after.","Another major struggle was to \"teach\" (although perhaps the correct term would be to specify) Whisper to also generate punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, question marks, and escalation marks.","Pay attention to this: when you dictate to Siri you have to specify the punctuation mark you want to add.","Small color note: this very article is accomplished by dictating to Siri while I am moving between home and office by car.","One of the great peculiarities of Whisper is that it can also figure out what punctuation marks are, but this is not something it does automatically, you have to specify some input parameters so that it understands that the context has to include them as well."]},{"l":"Before the prototype","p":["In short, teased by the Twitter discussion and the endorsement, I started playing around with this system, trying to figure out what I could get out of it and what the limitations of the technology were.","I think I managed to make a very first prototype, with, of course, a horrible user interface within 7-10 days. And, of course, I started testing it with all the work I was doing in March 2023, projects of various kinds: from pharmaceutical video presentations to a video game trailer to some tutorials.","Here I encountered the first limitations of Whisper, which performs exceptionally well when the audio is quite clear, content with a speaker or interviews, while it goes deeply into crisis in case music or sound effects are present.","Initially, I told myself that this would not be a big problem, just specify in the requirements that the application was best suited for spoken content, nevertheless I felt the need to refine it, so I rolled up my sleeves and wondered if there was a possibility of parsing the audio in such a way as to find the points where there was speech and then eliminate those where there was only music or sound effects.","I succeeded by taking advantage of some libraries provided by Apple for analyzing sounds. Subsequently, one thing I have been working on in parallel with both this app and the one that does text-to-speech is the highlighting of sentences in sync with the video (or, rather, with the audio).","I always thought that when doing a speech review, physically, the people in charge have in front of them a sheet, printed in Courier font, with all the features of the script. For this very reason I wanted the words and sentences to be written in this same style, not so much for skeuomorphism, but because it is still the most effective and efficient method of reading the text while listening to the related audio.","I worked not a little in such a way as to continuously highlight the line of text that is \"spoken\" at a particular moment in time.","When there is information that varies over time, the concept of a timeline is one of the strongest: it transforms the horizontal axis into that of time, so the playhead moves from left to right as the playback continues.","Showing in a two-dimensional screen information that evolves over time is never a trivial matter, not least because it involves making user interfaces and real-time interaction methods, which in some ways have more to do with video games than with video writing programs...","This is why I am particularly proud of this part of the code; not only is the segment highlighted with the sentence being spoken, but it is also easy to interact with it by correcting any transcription errors.","It sounds like a breeze, but believe me, it's not!"]},{"l":"3GB of passion","p":["Another big problem stemmed from the fact that the model I wanted to use, again in open source and with respect to legality, takes up a good 3GB, as I mentioned earlier.","Downloading a 3GB application, as annoying as it may seem, is not that problematic, for the installation to begin with.","But then I thought about all the times there would be a need for an upgrade, and downloading 3 GB of stuff, most of it always the same, would be particularly troublesome, especially in areas of the world where connection speeds are not comparable to those of the big European or North American metropolises.","So I set to work on making a system that would allow the downloading of the template only the first time, and among other things in \"shared\" mode, so that in case I wanted to develop another application based on the same technology, it could safely use the model already downloaded (spoiler: thing I have actually already done with FCP Video Tag)."]},{"l":"The field test","p":["\"Of course yes!\", I replied, and the fact that I had a real use case, with tight deadlines and a not inconsiderable qualitative demand, led me to work heavily on the application, so as to improve as much as possible the interface and also the possibility of exporting the subtitles in different formats, including text with total transcription, unsynchronized, and later also RTF with time code indication in a different style.","And it was during the interviews that it was asked if it was possible to have even a rough transcript of what was being said for medical and scientific review.","And since Transcriber's purpose is to extract the subtitles from the audio, I thought, more or less simply, to add precisely the subtitle overlay to the video, so the eyes are all and always in the same area of the screen.","At the end of April I had to go to Florence to attend a medical conference and do several interviews with many doctors, in a total of 12 languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, and Brazilian Portuguese.","I patted myself on the back because this stuff, in the end, among the transcription applications, I guess I only had it...","I told myself that there had to be a way to \"split\" a subtitle while still keeping the text in sync with the video.","In practice, the traditional transcription process, which involved typing the texts while continuing to pause the video, translates into an automatic process of \"raw\" transcription, which must necessarily be followed by a (much faster) checking phase.","In the end I decided that, as an option enabled by default, the system tries to figure out whether the user has pressed the ENTER button to wrap, and when it is pressed, the split sentence automatically generates two subtitles that are fairly synchronized to the video, where \"fairly\" means \"more or less imperceptibly.\"","Just by making these doctor interview videos, I told myself that by keeping the video played at the top of the interface separate with the transcribed text at the bottom, the user's attention would be focused on only one of the two.","Just looking at the overlay subtitles, I realized that although I had struggled not a little to try to get Whisper to digest the punctuation marks, in some cases the sentences were so long that they would result in huge subtitles that would take up too much of the screen.","Let me be clear: I have always considered Transcriber as a semi-automatic tool, this means that the transcription should still be reviewed a human being.","The boundary conditions are simple: artificial intelligences are very fast, very efficient and also very effective, but they don't understand what they are doing; it's just data to them. It's up to us to maintain control.","This also sounds like a no-brainer, but it's not, not least because the system, during playback, continuously updates itself (about 30 times per second) to try to figure out where it is, among all the phrases being spoken which one is active at that instant of time, and then highlights it at the bottom and shows the text content superimposed on the video.","This has led to better fluidity in handling the interface and the ability to interact very easily and very quickly on the text stream.","This is the philosophy of all the apps I make: automate as much as possible, while still leaving control, verification and, not least, responsibility to a flesh-and-blood guy.","You see, my applications are born and grow in a fairly almost \"autistic\" way, but then it is really with user testing (and also when I make tutorials) that I discover the limitations and areas where they can be improved."]},{"l":"Text Editor","p":["One of the features of Transcriber that I like best is the text editor, the subtitle editor.","From a purely technical and data structure point of view, each of the scripts corresponds to a different record in the document's \"internal database,\" called the Session.","When working with text, however, for example with Microsoft Word or Pages, what appears in the sheet is a single text that can be edited easily.","I did a lot of work so that text editing would be as similar as possible to that of a traditional word processor, while still allowing for the ability to manage how the texts remain \"attached\" (i.e., synchronized) to the video.","The whole component of transcription, and managing the synchronized texts, was one of the most complex but at the same time also quite elegant things I have ever done.","I tried to make things as simple as possible and as intuitive as possible for the user, while going out of my way to mask any complexities.","If a title is too long, it is highlighted with a red dot which means that, given its length, it would take up too much space in the frame.","The user then has the option of standing anywhere in the text and pressing the ENTER button to wrap, and by wrapping, in a natural way, the subtitle is broken into two different titles while still keeping all the words in sync.","Said like that sounds like a piece of cake, but believe me, this is something non-trivial! And this is also how I have operated with regard to the separation of subtitles while they are being transcribed and generated: trying to isolate sentences or sentence segments (separated by commas, \",\") as much as possible, so that we always have meaningful content to display, without truncated sentences or with subjects being in one subtitle and verbs being in another subtitle."]},{"i":"i-got-a-publisher","l":"I got a publisher!","p":["At the end of 2022 I was contacted by the guys at FxFactory because they were interested in publishing some of my apps on their store, on their marketplace.","This filled me with joy, pride, and also with fear: for the first time I would be playing in the big leagues, and I would have to maintain much higher quality standards; this time I would not be doing everything myself, but I would also have to be accountable to someone else for my work.","Initially we had planned to bring a couple of my most popular apps, such as BeatMark Pro or FCP Diet 2, to this marketplace, adding features and cleaning up the interface.","I, however, proposed that they start with a completely new app, whose name initially was Transcriptor.","I initially met some resistance, partly because such apps already existed, such as the aforementioned Macwhisper.","I then explained the reasons why this new app of mine could be something alternative and provide added and different value than the others.","In concomitance with NAB, where several apps that make use of artificial intelligence to aid production and post production were presented or announced, those in charge of FxFactory were convinced and switched on the green light.","One thing needs to be emphasized: FxFactory is not only a store, a showcase, but those who run it put their faces first and consequently require a level of quality, communication, and even user experience that is far superior to what I had had up to that point.","If I had commercialized Transcriber all by myself, it would probably have come out in some form of its own in late April or early May 2023.","Instead, FxFactory raised my bar higher and higher, trying to reach heights of communication, user interface, functionality, and overall quality level that I was not used to.","And, I have to be honest, I don't think I can thank them enough for making me grow, and making me grow so fast."]},{"l":"Exporting to Final Cut Pro","p":["Initially Transcriber was not supposed to allow exporting subtitles to Final Cut Pro because I already have an application in my catalog that does just that, FCP SRT Importer 2, by the way one of my most successful applications (which means that the gentlemen at Apple and whoever is in charge of managing Final Cut Pro development should ask themselves some questions if so many people need such a basic feature...).","Let's say I didn't want to cannibalize myself, even though I knew Transcriber would be a higher cost application, there would probably be enough of a market for one to buy Transcriber bundled with FCP SRT Importer 2.","But then, again for that Florence job, I realized that the double step: transcribing the subtitles, revising, exporting the subtitles to SRT format, then bringing them back into FCP SRT Importer 2, and finally communicating the whole thing with Final Cut Pro, was really... a big pain in the ass!","In the end I had all the technology, the know-how, why not add this feature to Transcriber as well?","And so I did, in the span of only one day I added all the features that were already in FCP SRT Importer 2 directly inside Transcriber.","It has to be said that, having chosen to make the UI in SwiftUI, creating configuration panels was never very complex, and one could focus more on business logic than on appearance and user interaction.","In short, the app was taking shape the decidedly concrete way."]},{"l":"Multiple SRTs","p":["The work of doctors in Florence has evolved over time, and the client also asked me for the ability to view interviews, but with subtitles translated into various languages.","Nothing could be simpler: after doing the transcription and export in SRT format, I proceeded to have these subtitles translated; and then imported into FCP SRT Importer 2 to make the localized videos in the various languages.","This, however, resulted in a decidedly disrupted workflow where I could not actually see the effect of the translated subtitles without first exporting them, or making a peer comparison between each individual sentence from the original to the translated version.","So it is, in a moment of madness (Alex, for next time, remember not to do this kind of thing again with a product that has not yet been released!) I expanded the underlying model, the data structure, to allow multiple subtitle imports.","Basically now Transcriber allows you to have infinite streams of subtitles, in various languages, and also to show side by side the original and translated sentence.","It may sound like a triviality, but this is really a very powerful feature, especially for those working with \"minor\" languages, for which localization, translation, export, and management of different streams is an integral part of the production and post production process.","Basically, with all this work done under the hood, I had transformed Transcriber from an application that deals with a single link in the localization management chain, into an aggregation center that allows for a global and centralized view of projects, always in synchronization between text and video.","Oh boy, this stuff was getting serious!"]},{"l":"The Dome Factory","p":["In the meantime, we got to the beginning of June 2023, I kept asking to get the application launched, but the publisher kept asking me for more and more refinements and better management of the interface.","They were certainly right, but the timing of these final cleanups and subsequent approval left me with an open project, and every time I used it, which happens pretty much every day, I would come up with little features to add.","As a result, what should have been a \"Minumum Viable Product\" was becoming an increasingly complex application, and of course with the need to handle any bugs I would generate by adding new code."]},{"i":"videos-videos-videos","l":"Videos, videos, videos!","p":["Since I had started to develop a system for synthetic speech of more or less \"sufficient\" quality, I decided to change the way I make promotional videos and this time use a synthetic speaker.","This might be a more or less debatable choice, I am the first to fear very much the \"uncanny valley\" effect, but I believe that the quality level of synthetic voices has reached such a level that, in any case, at least from my point of view, it is preferable to a promotional video made with only overlay text.","So here I made my first promo video.","And, because the application is definitely complex, some things may even seem intuitive, but to understand how the workflow works in my opinion you need to sit down for a moment and understand a little bit what is the best way to operate, I decided to also make some tutorials of increasing complexity, making use of both screen captures and animations made with Adobe After Effects, which is the program I use most in my first job as a video maker.","This time I tried to maintain a distinctly high level of quality, not only in the promo but also for all the side videos, it was a really big effort, maybe it might not look like it, however trying to show things in a quick, effective, clear, understandable way without becoming pompous, is not a child's play...","Find all the videos I made for Transcriber here.","And, in addition, one important thing there is to say: every time I set out to make a tutorial, therefore trying to do things the way any user would do them, I find a lot of mistakes or things that can be improved, so to make a video of a few minutes, it can take me even several days because, in the meantime, I am working on the code and improving the interface or adding features."]},{"l":"The run-up before the jump","p":["By early July 2023, the application had reached a level of stability that FxFactory said was sufficient to be marketed.","I was then asked to create artwork and a minimum description for marketing, as well as a promotional video.","All things I had already prepared, however, small problem: in the promotional video I had made I had used an image taken from a very famous movie.","Nothing you can't see anyway in any kind of promotional material from this same movie, however, the publisher politely asked me to replace it with something else so as to avoid any copyright issues.","Datum done, in one day I revamped the promotional video and made all the art work.","I was basically ready to go."]},{"l":"The Launch","p":["The launch was set for July 6, 2023, I received the news in the early afternoon, and on that day, I remember it was a Thursday, I was playing with my son and listening to some music.","I was so excited by the news that I started dancing, making my son jump up and down.","It was a scene somewhere between tender and ridiculous...","At 9:30pm, Italian time, the application was launched, and I noticed because I got the first email notification of successful transaction.","I was finally able to post news of the launch on Twitter with the link to be able to download the app in trial mode (for the record: in the trial version it allows you to transcribe the first 45 seconds of the movie or import subtitles for the first 45 seconds).","I spent months raising expectations about this app on Twitter, to the point where I had probably lost some credibility as well: I felt I was ready to launch in late April, early May, and then instead it was a full two months later...","Was it worth the wait?","From the end users' point of view I don't know, from my point of view?","Heck, yes!","This was the craziest launch ever since I started having this small software development business.","Having a publisher like FxFactory behind me, I achieved in two weeks what I set out to achieve in two years!","This does not mean that I have become rich, this does not mean that the pressure has eased, and after the initial explosion, the values settle down to a more or less quiet regime.","And the first week, but perhaps also the second week, were weeks of great work on my part to improve the things that were missing, add the features that were requested, as well as fix some idiosyncrasies and bugs: I had never been able to test the application with complex languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and I found that syntactic construction and more or less \"special\" characters needed to be handled more accurately.","Let's say that I haven't slept, or slept very little, for about two weeks now..."]},{"i":"and-now","l":"And now?","p":["Now, that this app is in the world, since it is in the hands of so many people, I have discovered so many use cases and

of.","The first weeks, the first months after launch are characterized by a flood of new ideas and suggestions, many of which can be accepted and turned into new features, some of which cannot, because they would meet the needs of too few users or would be difficult to implement...","No app is perfect, no app is complete, software is increasingly something that is constantly evolving and transforming.","Very often I look back and think that many of the programs I have built over the years came about because Apple had not put some functionalities, even very basic ones, directly inside

When you develop an application, your project links to one or more frameworks. For example, iPhone application projects link by default to the Foundation, UIKit, and Core Graphics frameworks. Your code accesses the capabilities of a framework through the application programming interface (API), which is published by the framework through its header files. Because the library is dynamically shared, multiple applications can access the framework code and resources simultaneously. The system loads the code and resources of a framework into memory, as needed, and shares the one copy of a resource among all applications."]},{"l":"History Lesson","p":["Phil Pan writes on Alex4D's Facebook Page:","I worked on that team for five years. There wasn't much work done on merging Shake and FCP. Most of the advanced work done by the core Shake team focused on the Helium renderer, which today is core to Pro Apps today. Shake's genius was how it was ultra-efficient as CPU-only code. Management had little interest in Shake and most resources went to Motion and Aperture; projects that Steve could related to when he wasn't completely absorbed by the iPad, the iPhone and the iTunes business ecosystem. The author of this patent, Christophe Souchard, is a French mathematician who had tons of prior experience at Discreet/Autodesk. He joined Apple when it purchased his Senso technology, which was the first Intel-based library to do advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion using motion vector estimation. While at Apple, Christophe's skills impressed management enough that his position was labelled \"Applied Magic\", and a veteran aerospace software engineer was hired to perform curation and clerical code management for his inventions. He introduced the team to methods using partial differential equations and while exteremely slow to compute, his next-generation prototypes performed jaw-dropping feats 15 years before similar tools would be introduced by Adobe. None of this work ever came out because Apple had a policy not to release compute-intensive software. Randy Ubillos (father of FCP and close to Steve) wouldn't accept any operation that took longer than a second per frame to render. This relegated Christophe to a research position for a while, until Randy got so impressed that he monopolized Christophe to work on advanced concepts for FCPX. Randy had some clever ideas about shot alignment and automatic editing, and this patent is the result of one of their collaborative projects. Today Christophe works at Unity Technologies doing advanced AR work, and he consults on the side when he has the time. He's recently rumored to have authored the rendering engine for ColorSynth, a complex colour grading plugin for FCPX and Premiere.","Helium was done in Santa Monica by the mad frenchmen team at Apple; Arnaud Hervas, Emmanuel Mogenet and Chrisophe Souchard. Arnaud was the co-founder of Nothing Real, the company that produced Shake. The idea was to do automatic tiled rendering using all available compute resources, so CPU cores and GPU(s). It was a lot trickier than people would think, as math functions would be rounded differently on different resources, and this would affect pixel values. The renderer has to evaluate the render graph to intelligently tile the proper regions-of-interest; i.e. it has to know the size of convolution kernels and all parts of a shader to produce tiles that will later merge properly, and it has to do all of this in real-time. Beautiful work. Emmanuel is now an executive at Google Research in Switzerland. Arnaud is growing tomatoes in Culver City, when he's not working on camera alignement software. Apple could have done a lot more in the high end, but in the last days of Steve, the company shifted its focus on the mass market and mobile devices. It was the right thing to do for all the reasons we know today (the Bottom Line being the most evident), but in so doing it hurt engineering effors in high-end imaging across the world; Adobe was going through a bad patch and the Discreet team at Autodesk was in disarray. The high-end was picked up by The Foundry: Its founder, Bruno Nicoletti (a Discreet alumnus) had the clever idea to acquire Nuke from Digital Domain and he had the skills and industry knowledge to turn it into the work-horse that it's become today. Still, Nuke is a geek's tool and there could have been an opportunity for a more artist-oriented solution in the high-end. This would not be one of Apple's pursuits: After a couple of years of soul-searching it became clear in 2007 that the future of Apple would be the iPhone and that all the Pro Apps stuff was no longer interesting. It survived nonetheless and I'd say that today the spirit of high(ish) end imaging is coming back to Apple. But so is the case at Adobe. In the end, the consumer wins and it's an exciting time to be buying graphics solutions."]},{"l":"Plugins","p":["Internally, Final Cut Pro supports and contains a number of different plugin types and formats:"]},{"l":"Compressor","p":["Contains CompressorKit.bundle- which can also be found in Compressor and Motion - it's basically the Compressor engine."]},{"l":"FCP-DAL","p":["Contains ACD.plugin- a CoreMediaIO plugin that enables the \"A/V Output\" feature in Final Cut Pro.","The CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) is analogous to CoreAudio’s Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

Core Data manages the serialised version.","Core Data can interface directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL - but it's not a SQL wrapper, and offers a much higher level of abstraction. Instead of writing SQL, you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request. However, because Core Data can use SQLite, it's easy to get confused with the differences between SQLite and Core Data. Remember that Core Data isn’t a database. If you want an Object-relational mapping (O/RM) or SQL wrapper, Core Data is not what you want.","Essentially, Core Data is a model layer technology, that's been designed to help programmers do lots of cool stuff, whilst writing less code. It's a toolkit that allows developers to more easily access and manipulate data. For example, it has built-in undo/redo management, allowing developers to add complex undo/redo functionality to their applications with minimum code.","Even though Core Data is a fantastic framework, there are several drawbacks. These drawbacks are directly related to the nature of the framework and how it works.","Core Data can only do its magic because it keeps the object graph it manages in memory. This means that it can only operate on records once they’re in memory. This is very different from performing a SQL query on a database. If you want to delete thousands of records, Core Data first needs to load each record into memory. It goes without saying that this results in memory and performance issues if done incorrectly.","Another important limitation is the threading model of Core Data. The framework expects to be run on a single thread. Fortunately, Core Data has evolved dramatically over the years and the framework has put various solutions in place to make working with Core Data in a multithreaded environment safer and easier.","For applications that need to manage a complex object graph (i.e. Final Cut Pro), Core Data is a great fit."]},{"l":"DeepSkyLite","p":["Final Cut Pro uses a lot of internal Frameworks, which you can learn more about here.","Within the Flexo Framework, is a framework called DeepSkyLite, which is essentially the \"database engine\" for Final Cut Pro.","Inside the DeepSkyLite Framework is two Compiled Core Data Models:","DSLite_v1.mom","DSLite_v2b1.mom","A .mom file is a binary property list that's NSKeyedArchiver encoded.

Now, you're all using the same master copy of the project, but you're all working separately. When you're ready to add your part to the master copy, you don't just want to plop it in there. You want your friends to check it over, make sure it fits with everything else, and then add it in when they agree it's ready. This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.","A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or \"project,\" you often work on your own copy, or \"branch\". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a \"pull request\". This is a proposal that says \"I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project\".","Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they \"merge\" them into the shared project.
