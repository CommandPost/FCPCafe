They have worked very hard for over a decade on making Final Cut Pro better and better. This open letter is aimed at the executives who set the priorities of the Final Cut Pro development team and the Apple managers whose policies limit the public marketing of Final Cut Pro to a couple of website updates a year and some mentions in Apple keynotes about how much faster Apple hardware is getting.","The letter’s signatories aim was to encourage Apple to make a new commitment to the professional TV and filmmaking industry. They believe that would potentially benefit filmmakers the world over regardless of their personal NLE preferences.","Competition is a positive. Apple has demonstrated a willingness to swing big. The very fact that they are not exclusively tethered to our industry allows them to try things others likely can’t. We hope you’ll support us in encouraging one of the heaviest hitters in media and technology to more forcefully push the boundaries of all of our tools.","They gathered some comments about Final Cut Pro and Apple:","Galliano Olivier, editor of ‘Marianne,’ a French TV drama series edited in Final Cut and distributed by Netflix says “In France, it is extremely difficult to get permission to edit TV with Final Cut Pro. You can’t use it without fighting producers, directors, post-production supervisors, sound editors, etc...”","Knut Hake BFS, editor of ‘Blood Red Sky,’ a feature film distributed by Netflix and edited using Final Cut Pro commented, “I think it would make a big difference for workflow consultants, systems integrators and third-party developers if there was a public Beta program for Final Cut Pro. Apple already do it for iOS, macOS and even Safari. It would make Final Cut more reliable and make it much easier for people to fit Final Cut into their plans for the future.”","Steven Sanders, editor in chief of of the Fox TV series ‘War of the Worlds’ season 3 said “The two main reasons why I am often not allowed to chose my favourite editing application, which is Final Cut Pro are: 1. Collaboration! Editing big productions needs collaboration. Different users have to be able to access the same library at the same time. There is no way around this. Avid Media Composer does it and even DaVinci Resolve does it. Apple still targets the single user. They have to change that. That will change everything. 2. Many professionals do not know how Final Cut works. They are afraid of it, even regard is as ‘iMovie Pro.’ I hear that all the time in my business. This perception really has to change.\"","Vanessa E. Brogna, assistant editor of ‘Bridgerton’ one of the top TV shows on Netflix commented: “Final Cut Pro is my favorite NLE. It's an absolute powerhouse and I feel the most creative and productive. Doing one step in Final Cut is about 3-4 in other NLEs. However, the real magic of Final Cut is its free form style of editing. Editing on a magnetic timeline is streamlined and smooth so I can still be organized, but I'm able to spend more time experimenting in the edit creatively and finesse my work.“","Jeff Asher, editor of ‘Big Sky,’ a US TV series on ABC and Hulu, says “As a TV editor, my job consists of being creative and being fast. Final Cut is the best NLE to achieve both of those goals. Now we need Apple on board with a roadmap and open dialogue with Film and TV creators to restore confidence lost over ten years ago.”"]},{"l":"Press"},{"l":"Before","p":["An open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro, signed by editors and post-production pros around the world (ProVideo Coalition)"]},{"i":"after","l":"After:","p":["Apple responds to the open letter to Tim Cook about Final Cut Pro (ProVideo Coalition)","Apple responds to open letter about improving usage and reputation of Final Cut Pro in filmmaking industry (9to5mac)","Apple Response to “Final Cut Pro in TV and Film” Open Letter (fcp.co)","Apple Responds to Open Letter Demanding Improvement of Final Cut Pro (PetaPixel)"]},{"i":"open-letter-19th-april-2022","l":"Open Letter (19th April 2022)","p":["Abbas Fahdel, Director of ‘Homeland: Iraq Year Zero,’ Feature Documentary, Iraq","Andrea Chignoli, Editor of ‘\"No\" directed by Pablo Larrain,’ Feature Film, Chile","Andreas Menn, Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany+Swiss","Andrew McKee BFE, Editor of ‘Eaten by Lions,’ Feature Film, UK","Azusa Yamazaki, Editor of ‘Drive My Car,’ Feature Film, Japan","Benjamin Ikes, Editor of ‘Buba,’ Feature Film, Germany","Benjamin Mercer F.C.E, Editor of ‘Unknown Soldier / Tuntematon Sotilas,’ Feature Film, Finland","Beverly Maguire BFE, Editor of ‘It’s Pony,’ Animated TV series, UK","Bo Li, Editor of ‘Plastic China,’ Feature Documentary, China","Brad Stoddard, Finish Editor / Colorist of ‘Sakura & Pearls: Healing From World War II ,’ Feature Documentary, US","Brett Ramsey, Editor of ‘In Pit Lane ,’ TV News, Australia","Brian Zwiener, Assistant Editor of ‘Terminator: Dark Fate,’ Feature Film, US","Carsten Behrendt, Editor of ‘Helden der Hauptstadt,’ Feature Documentary, Germany","Chad Tremblay, Editor of ‘Hunter Hunter,’ Feature Film, Canada","Chankanet Leksomboon, First Assistant Editor of ‘Bangkok Breaking,’ TV Drama Series, Thailand","Chris Black, Editor of ‘Fly the flag for Human Rights',’ TV Documentary Series, UK","Chris Hocking, Editor of ‘Neighbours: Erinsborough High,’ TV Limited Series/Mini Series, Australia","Christopher Darlington, Editor of ‘The Uncluttered Worlds of Christopher Pratt,’ Feature Documentary, Canada","Clark N Henderson, Assistant Editor of ‘Paramedics: Emergency Response,’ TV Factual Series, Canada","Cris Mertens, Editor of ‘Young Justice: Phantoms,’ Animated Series, US","Daniel Rakete Siegel, Director of ‘Schock (WT),’ Feature Film, Germany","David Maria Vogel BFS, First Assistant Editor of ‘The Colony,’ Feature Film, Germany/Switzerland","David Peterson, Editor of ‘Bluey,’ TV Animated Series, Australia","David Wieching BFS, Editor of ‘Schock,’ Feature Film, Germany","Dayyan Eng, Editor of ‘Wished,’ Feature Film, China","Dear Tim Cook,","Debby Germino, Editor of ‘Genius,’ TV Drama Series, US","Dimitri Amar, Editor of ‘Marianne,’ TV Drama Series, France","Dirk Grau, Editor of ‘Charite II ,’ TV Drama Series, Germany","Fabien Leroy, Editor of ‘Graines d'étoiles, 5 ans après,’ TV Documentary Series, France","Fernanda Tornaghi, Editor of ‘Girl in the Picture,’ Feature Documentary, US","Final Cut Pro is a wonderful application used by many YouTubers, education and small business content creators worldwide.

When you're done, you can switch back to the full-resolution media for final output.","Organize Your Media: Keep your footage and assets well-organized. Use libraries, events, and keywords to categorize and manage your footage. This will make finding and accessing the clips you need much faster.","Use Presets: If you find yourself often applying the same settings or effects, save them as presets. This can be done for color grading, audio effects, and more.","Optimize Your Hardware: Make sure your computer is up to the task. Keep your software up to date, ensure you have enough free storage space, and consider upgrades to your RAM or GPU if necessary.","Batch Operations: Perform tasks such as transcoding, rendering, and exporting in batches, ideally during downtime, to avoid interrupting your editing flow.","Learn to Use the Magnetic Timeline: The magnetic timeline is one of Final Cut Pro's unique features. It helps maintain synchronization when moving clips around, which can save you time rearranging your timeline.","Color Coding: Use color coding for your clips and timelines. This can help you quickly locate related material or sequences.","Use the Skimming Feature: The skimming feature allows you to quickly review your footage and makes cutting and trimming faster.","Storyboard Your Videos: Before even starting with Final Cut Pro, have a clear idea of what you want to achieve.

This could be a deciding factor if you're not using Apple hardware.","Pricing Model: Final Cut Pro offers a one-time purchase, which can be more affordable in the long run. On the other hand, Adobe Premiere Pro follows a subscription model that can be more flexible and also includes updates as long as the subscription is active, but tends to be more expensive over time.","Performance: Final Cut Pro is known for its performance optimization for Apple hardware, which can make it run more smoothly on Macs. Adobe Premiere Pro can also deliver good performance but may not be as optimized for specific hardware.","Interface and Workflow: Final Cut Pro uses a Magnetic Timeline, which offers a different editing experience by automatically moving clips to avoid gaps and collisions. Premiere Pro uses a more traditional track-based timeline, which can be more intuitive to those coming from other editing software. This aspect largely comes down to personal preference.","Integration with Other Software: Premiere Pro is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, so it integrates very well with other Adobe products like After Effects and Photoshop. Final Cut Pro also has some level of integration with other Apple software like Motion and Compressor, but the Adobe ecosystem is generally more extensive.","Learning Curve: Both programs have a steep learning curve due to their advanced capabilities, but some users find Final Cut Pro to be more user-friendly initially.","Support for Formats and Codecs: Both support a wide range of video formats and codecs, but there may be differences in support for specific formats. For example, you'll need to use a third party solution called BRAW Toolbox to use BRAW files in Final Cut Pro.","Collaboration Features: Adobe Premiere Pro has a feature called \"Team Projects\" for cloud-based collaboration between editors. You'll need to use a third party solution like PostLab to easily collaborate in Final Cut Pro.","It's important to note that both are professional-grade tools capable of high-level editing and post-production work.

Honestly, from that point on it works so incredibly well that I really struggle to understand why Apple has made it so difficult. Except it's not difficult, not anymore.

Known for its powerful capabilities and intuitive interface, Final Cut Pro has come a long way since its inception. Today, let's explore this extraordinary journey of innovation and technological progression."]},{"l":"The Genesis of an Idea","p":["The story begins with Randy Ubillos, a name widely associated with the creation of the first three versions of Adobe Premiere Pro. His team's knack for developing professional video editing programs was then recognized by Macromedia, leading them to embark on a new project, KeyGrip.","KeyGrip was a more professional video editing program, built on Apple's QuickTime, which was intended for Macromedia's portfolio. However, due to licensing issues with Truevision, and Macromedia's shift towards web market solutions, the project hit a roadblock. Macromedia decided to sell its desktop applications, including the embryonic KeyGrip."]},{"l":"Birth of the Final Cut Pro","p":["In a pivotal year of 1998, KeyGrip was renamed Final Cut, and showcased as a 0.9 alpha version at the NAB Show. With no buyers, Apple, recognizing the potential of the software, stepped in and acquired the development team.","Contrary to expectations, Apple continued the development work, despite the lack of a buyer. The team made significant enhancements to the software, such as adding FireWire support, and finally, in 1999, it was released as Final Cut Pro at the NAB show."]},{"l":"Building a Community","p":["To ensure that Final Cut Pro received solid support from the start, Apple adopted an aggressive marketing and training strategy. They joined forces with DVcreators.net to launch a training disc, \"Final Cut Pro PowerStart\", and hosted hundreds of free and paid seminars worldwide. This strategy significantly boosted the software's early market visibility and success.","During this time, Final Cut Pro also capitalized on the decline of Adobe Premiere in the Mac market. A strategic trade-in program in 2003 allowed Adobe Premiere users to switch to Final Cut Express for free or avail of a hefty discount on Final Cut Pro."]},{"l":"Pioneering Broadcast Quality","p":["A defining factor in the success of Final Cut Pro was the robust QuickTime platform, particularly its support for new DV cameras connected via FireWire. The software found its application in the production of the first fully broadcast quality, globally distributed TV show, Women of Wrestling in 2000. Networks, such as Oxygen, also adopted the software to produce shows like SheCommerce.","By 2003, Final Cut Pro was credited for facilitating the production of the controversial film \"PlayCouples, A New Era of Swinging\". The software demonstrated its reliability during the film rendering, and this positive experience led to more endorsements from industry professionals. Such endorsements boosted its acceptance as a professional editing tool and culminated in a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for its influence on the television industry in 2002."]},{"l":"The Evolution of Final Cut Pro","p":["Final Cut Pro continued to evolve, with the 4th version in 2003, introducing new applications such as Compressor, LiveType, and Soundtrack for advanced editing needs. Over time, the software strengthened its support for various video formats and integrated with additional tools to provide a comprehensive editing solution.","By 2006, Apple stopped selling Final Cut Pro as a standalone product, making it available only as part of the Final Cut Studio bundle. It also introduced the universal binary version, enhancing the software's flexibility and performance.","Subsequent versions, Final Cut Pro 6 and 7, introduced in 2007 and 2009 respectively, brought more functionalities and integrations.

The significant changes implemented by Apple shook many long-time users. Some of the main points of contention were the lack of backward compatibility with projects from previous versions and the initial absence of features like multi-cam editing and the ability to edit tape-based media.","Notably, there was also a transition in the distribution model, as Apple decided to make the software available only via download through the Mac App Store. This change proved challenging for mass enterprise deployment.","To gain an idea of the extent of the initial backlash, you can watch Conan O'Brien's satirical response on his talk show."]},{"l":"Behind the Scenes","p":["Phil Pan on Alex4D's Facebook Group, from the development team reveals that much of the advanced work from the core Shake team during this time was focused on the Helium renderer, a technology that is still central to Apple's Pro Apps today.","Interestingly, Phil indicated that management was more invested in projects such as Motion and Aperture that resonated with Steve Jobs and less in Shake. During this time, Apple acquired French mathematician Christophe Souchard's Senso technology, an advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion tool using motion vector estimation.","At Apple, Souchard’s skills impressed management so much that his position was titled \"Applied Magic.\" He contributed to the development of next-generation prototypes, introducing methods using partial differential equations. However, due to Apple's policy against releasing compute-intensive software, much of this work never saw the light of day.","The shift in Apple's focus towards mass-market and mobile devices during the final years of Steve Jobs' leadership had a profound impact on the engineering efforts in high-end imaging worldwide."]},{"l":"Rising from the Ashes","p":["Despite the tumultuous start, Apple stood firm, continuously refining and improving FCPX. Through free updates, many of the missing features were reintroduced, and new ones were added.","A significant contribution was the Magnetic Timeline, which allowed for fluid, flexible editing, simplifying the process of exploring story ideas. Additionally, the introduction of Compound Clips further streamlined complex projects.","A major leap forward came with the new 64-bit architecture and GPU utilization. This allowed editors to work with larger frame sizes, higher frame rates, and more effects — all in real-time."]},{"l":"The Current State of Final Cut Pro X","p":["Today, Final Cut Pro X has matured into a powerful and efficient editing platform.

In this post, we will explore the best practices for using Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing. This will ensure your workflow is optimized, your output is professional, and your editing process is efficient."]},{"l":"Organise Your Workflow","p":["Create a Sound Workflow Structure:","Before starting the editing process, it's crucial to establish a well-structured workflow. In the context of long-form feature films, this often involves breaking down your project into scenes or sequences, each with its own dedicated project file within Final Cut Pro. This allows for focused editing and simplifies collaboration, as different editors can work on different scenes simultaneously.","Consistent Naming Conventions:","Consistency is key to smooth editing, especially for large projects like feature films. Use consistent naming conventions for your clips, sequences, and projects. This will make it much easier to locate and identify specific assets as your project grows.","Leverage Metadata:","Final Cut Pro allows users to input and leverage metadata for clips, such as scene number, shot number, take number, and more. You can also add custom metadata. Using metadata effectively can greatly enhance organization and searchability within your project."]},{"l":"Understanding RAM Requirements","p":["One crucial aspect of achieving optimal performance with Final Cut Pro revolves around understanding and addressing the software's RAM requirements. In particular, running FCP on Apple silicon (Apple's own line of processors) requires careful consideration. As all new Macs now use Apple silicon, it's important to get this right.","Apple Silicon and Unified Memory:","Unlike traditional computer architecture, where the CPU and GPU have separate memory (RAM and VRAM), Apple Silicon uses a unified memory architecture. This means that the CPU and GPU share the same pool of memory. As a result, your RAM has to serve the needs of both processing and graphics tasks.","For long-form feature film editing in Final Cut Pro, this has several implications:","Greater RAM demands: Feature films require handling high-resolution footage, multiple video tracks, complex effects, and color grading, among others. These tasks can put significant strain on your RAM.","Multitasking needs: If you are using other demanding apps alongside Final Cut Pro, such as other creative apps, your RAM needs will be even higher.","Importance of choosing the right Mac model: When buying an Apple Silicon Mac, you can't upgrade the RAM later, unlike with some previous Intel-based Mac models. So, it's important to consider your RAM needs upfront.","How Much RAM Do You Need?","As a baseline, Apple recommends a minimum of 8GB RAM for Final Cut Pro:","4GB of RAM (8GB recommended for 4K editing, 3D titles and 360° video editing)","However, for long-form feature film editing, you'll likely need more.","16GB RAM: This should be considered the minimum for professional work, such as editing feature films. It will allow for smooth editing of 4K footage and some flexibility for multitasking.","32GB RAM or higher: If you're working with 6K, 8K, or multiple streams of 4K video, or if you use lots of effects, consider 32GB or even 64GB of RAM. These larger RAM options will also provide greater flexibility for heavy multitasking and future-proof your setup as software demands increase over time.","At LateNite we're primarily using MacBook Pro's (2021 16-inch, Apple M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 3TB SSD), and they're rock solid.","While the unified memory architecture in Apple Silicon offers advantages such as increased efficiency and speed, it also places greater demands on your system's RAM. Therefore, when planning to use Final Cut Pro for long-form feature film editing on an Apple Silicon Mac, consider opting for at least 16GB of RAM, or even 32GB or 64GB for more complex projects and improved future-proofing. Remember, it's better to have a bit more RAM than you need, rather than not having enough when you need it most."]},{"l":"Understanding Drive Requirements","p":["An often underappreciated factor that can significantly impact your video editing workflow is the type of storage you use. When it comes to editing in Final Cut Pro, especially long-form feature film editing, opting for a Solid State Drive (SSD) over a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD) can make a significant difference.","Choosing the Right Storage for Final Cut Pro: SSDs Over Spinning Disks:","External SSDs: High-capacity external SSDs have become increasingly affordable. They can be an excellent solution for expanding your storage space without having to replace your internal drive.","Faster Read/Write Speeds: SSDs offer dramatically faster data transfer rates compared to HDDs. This means that video files can be read, copied, and written much quicker, which is critical when dealing with large, high-resolution video files typical in feature film editing.","Greater Reliability: Because they have no moving parts, SSDs are less likely to suffer mechanical failures, making them more reliable than HDDs. This is critical when working on important projects like feature films, where data loss can be disastrous.","HDDs, or hard disk drives, are traditional storage devices that use mechanical, moving parts to read and write data. They are made up of spinning disks, hence the name \"spinning disks.\" HDDs are typically slower and less reliable (due to potential mechanical failure), but they usually offer more storage space for a lower price.","Improved Multitasking: SSDs are better at handling multiple tasks simultaneously, such as playing back multiple video streams, which is common in multicam editing or when working with complex timelines.","In 2023, you should definitely be removing slow spinning disks from your editing workflow entirely. (You might still choose to use them for backup.)","Manage Storage Space: SSDs typically have less space than HDDs. Be diligent about deleting rendered files, proxies, and other temporary files that Final Cut Pro generates during editing to free up space.","On the other hand, SSDs, or solid-state drives, are storage devices that use flash memory (similar to your smartphone or USB thumb drive) to store data. Because there are no moving parts, SSDs are significantly faster and more reliable than HDDs. However, they are also typically more expensive per gigabyte.","Practical Tips for Using SSDs with Final Cut Pro:","Quicker Rendering and Exporting: The faster speeds of SSDs also translate to quicker rendering and exporting times in Final Cut Pro. This is particularly important in a professional setting, where time is often of the essence.","The Advantages of SSDs for Final Cut Pro","Understanding HDDs vs SSDs:","While HDDs may be more cost-effective in terms of raw storage space, the speed, and reliability benefits offered by SSDs make them a superior choice for use with Final Cut Pro, especially for demanding tasks like long-form feature film editing.","While SSDs are clearly advantageous for video editing, it's important to use them strategically to balance performance and cost:","Working Drive: If you can't afford a large SSD, consider at least getting a smaller one to use as a 'working drive'. You can store your current project on the SSD for fast performance, then move finished projects to an HDD for long-term storage."]},{"l":"Storage Locations","p":["To keep library sizes as small as possible (which makes backing them up and sharing them easier), we always recommend keeping your media and cache external to the library.","Storing your media inside the library is an option for solo editors who do not work collaboratively, but external media offers more power and flexibility."]},{"l":"Library Organisation","p":["Each event in Final Cut Pro is its own Core Data database.","You can learn more about the library structure here.","Given this, we recommend splitting up your media into multiple events, rather than putting all your media in a single event powered by a single database.","We recommend using emojis in event names, to differentiate the list of events more clearly.","For example, this is from a 5 x 30min broadcast television special:","You can learn more about this workflow here.","Here's an example of a library for a job where all the user interface designs were build in Final Cut Pro for a game:","Here's an example of a library for a basic corporate edit:","If you're working on a very heavy feature film, your current feature length timeline should be in its own event."]},{"l":"Avoid Snapshots","p":["Snapshots are the devil. You're much better off using something like PostLab.","When you duplicate a project as a snapshot, Final Cut Pro embeds copies of compound or multicam “parent” clips in the duplicate, so any changes to other instances of those clips do not affect the duplicate.","Generally speaking, when you're working with a long-form project, all of your media is generally a Multicam Clip (because you're syncing with external audio) — so each time you create a Snapshot you're essentially creating a duplicate of all the clips metadata.","When you create a Snapshot, Final Cut Pro generates copies of your used clips and any connected clips, including titles, effects, compound clips, and multicam clips. All of these elements contribute to the overall size of the Snapshot.","While Snapshots can be a valuable tool for preserving your project's state at a specific point in time, excessive use can have a significant impact on your library size and performance. This can in turn affect Final Cut Pro's performance.","An overly large Final Cut Pro library can lead to several issues:","Reduced System Performance: A bloated library can slow down Final Cut Pro's performance, making it less responsive and lengthening render and export times.","Limited Storage Space: If your library size becomes excessively large, it can occupy a substantial portion of your available storage space. This can be particularly problematic if you're working with limited storage capacities, such as on a laptop with a small SSD.","Back-up Challenges: Large libraries can also be more challenging to back up, as they require more storage space and more time to copy to your backup drive."]},{"l":"Edit with Proxy Media","p":["Long-form editing, particularly at high resolutions (4K, 8K), can be quite demanding on system resources. To ensure a smooth editing experience, Final Cut Pro offers a 'proxy workflow'. This allows you to create lower-resolution versions (proxies) of your footage for editing. Once the editing is complete, you can easily switch back to the original high-resolution files for final output."]},{"l":"Use the Magnetic Timeline","p":["The Magnetic Timeline is one of the unique features of Final Cut Pro. It offers a trackless approach to editing, allowing clips to automatically slide into place and avoid clip collisions and sync problems. This is particularly useful in feature film editing, where you may be juggling hundreds or even thousands of clips."]},{"l":"Master Your Tools and Shortcuts","p":["Final Cut Pro offers a wide range of tools for tasks such as trimming, re-timing, and applying effects. Mastering these tools, along with the keyboard shortcuts for commonly used functions, can significantly speed up your editing process."]},{"i":"leverage-final-cut-pros-multicam-editing","l":"Leverage Final Cut Pro's Multicam Editing","p":["If your film includes footage from multiple cameras, Final Cut Pro's Multicam editing feature can be a major time-saver. It allows you to sync up to 64 angles of video footage using audio waveforms, timecode, or markers. Once synced, you can cut between angles in real time while watching the multicam viewer."]},{"i":"use-compound-clips-and-roles-for-organisation--efficiency","l":"Use Compound Clips and Roles for Organisation & Efficiency","p":["Compound Clips allow you to bundle separate clips together into a single clip, which can then be edited as one. This is useful for managing complex sequences or visual effects compositions.","Roles in Final Cut Pro allow you to label and organize different types of audio such as dialogue, effects, and music. When exporting, you can output multiple versions of your mix (such as stereo and surround) or a file with separated roles for further mixing or mastering."]},{"l":"Keep Regular Backups","p":["Given the scale and importance of feature film projects, it's essential to keep regular backups of your work. Final Cut Pro's built-in backup tool makes this process easy and automatic. Backups can be accessed from the File > Open Library > From Backup command, but they can also be found in the Finder, in Home > Movies > Final Cut Backups > LIBRARYNAME."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Final Cut Pro is a powerful tool for long-form feature film editing, but like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how it's used. By adopting these best practices, you can ensure that your editing process is efficient, your workflow is smooth, and the end result is a feature film of professional quality. Remember, the key to successful film editing is a combination of technical skill, organization, creativity, and storytelling.","Want to contribute?

This was all tracked using a Google Sheet with the shots available to the whole team via Box.","As the edit started to come together, I’d share my thoughts with Mike and the producer who would look at WIP edits and communicate notes back to the animators based on shots that may need some minor tweaks to help the edit. It might be a frame here and there or (very occasionally) a whole rethink, but due to time restraints, we’d often have to compromise, focusing on what served the story and what was achievable in the time and with the resources we had at our disposal.","Being from a live action background, this was a different workflow for me. During pre-production, Mike would board each episode and build an animatic in Storyboard Pro which had a voice scratch track that Mike would produce himself, along with basic sound design elements and some music tracks for reference.","Below you’ll see my basic library setup for the project. The Library title was unfortunately auto generated by PostLab so the naming convention is a bit funky. A while ago, Chris Hocking who is the head of post at LateNite introduced using emojis in our Event & Folder naming structures. Although a simple thing, I’ve found this to be useful in identifying folders and events quickly and efficiently, particularly when you’re under the pump. Sometimes it’s the little things that help to keep a workflow moving.","Due to the pace in which we were working, and with multiple animators across each episode, there would occasionally be minor slip ups with the colour of a prop or a missing design element as we cut from a wide to a tight. In this instance, if we could we’d do a quick fix we would, rather than having to go back to the animator who might’ve already moved on to the next episode.","For post, we set up the project in PostLab so we could utilise the collaboration tools it offered. We encountered a few issues, with some work lost when uploading changes, however the terrible internet in Melbourne could have equally been to blame. As mentioned, the animatics for the series were produced in Storyboard Pro, from which we could export Final Cut Pro XML (.xml) files, along with any rendered visuals separated by panels. Using SendToX, I then produced a timeline with cut points along with Mike’s temp audio work. This was essentially my starting point.","Hi! I'm Kevin, the editor of The Future of Everything, a 2D animated anthology comedy series created by writer/director Mike Greaney.","If we got stuck, we’d occasionally have to pull some tricks, like repeating frames or holding frames to get the frame or two required to fix our issues.","Once I got into the edit, I would use Mike’s animatic for timing, to spot any unwanted changes that may have occurred during the migration, and to spot missing shots that may have gone unallocated or missed by the team. On episode one, I would sometimes use the .xml from the animatics to do scene detection in DaVinci Resolve, however I found that the exports from Storyboard Pro were reliable, so I abandoned this step pretty early on.","Once we had what we’ll call our first assembly edit in place with our completed shots, I’d look at the rhythm of each shot in the context of the edit, and start building a more robust sound design from the animatic.","Once we locked our edit - we’d then turn over our temp sound and music to the designer and composer respectively. On this job we were fortunate that Dead on Sound handled both. We’d export an AAF with X2Pro, with settings to discard any inactive or disabled audio. We’d also embed the audio with eight-second handles. When the mixes and stems came back as .wav files, it was just a matter of adding them as connected clips, assigning a new role, and disabling all other audio roles.","One area where live action differs from animation, is that the animatic is where you get your timing and ‘edit’ right before you start animating. Our focus during this period was sharing notes between the team on Frame.io and finessing the animatic so that by the time we entered the edit, there were really only minor tweaks required to reach our final locked off master.","That first episode was about setting up how our workflow was going to function, so there was a bit or trial and error involved, but once we found something that worked for our post team, as well as Mike and the producers, we stuck to it for the remainder of the series.","This Post-it note on top is my first prop design debut, helping to fix a continuity problem.","To finish with an interesting aside - we found that the episodes with less dialogue and narration tended to be the ones that required more tweaks, as the pacing tended to be more dictated by the animation rather than sound. Not hugely relevant to our workflow, but interesting none the less!","With the first twelve shots that I received, I exported ProRes 4444 from Adobe Animate and then imported them into keyword collections, that were organised by date, in the Animations Event I’d created. This became my process, eventually welcoming all 51 shots into my timeline for episode one. As mentioned, I used the .xml to help me lineup shots for timing, and would export weekly WIP edits for Mike and the producers to review."]},{"l":"Watch Series"},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"der-schatten-the-shadow","l":"Der Schatten (The Shadow)","p":["Case Study for a Mystery Thriller Series"]},{"l":"The Story","p":["A young journalist, Norah, moves from Berlin to Vienna to start a new job.

These little chunks are reordered so that you can watch every similar part of every take in succession. In this way you can quickly compare every angle and find the best shot or dialogue.","Shortly before our production started Chris Hocking had the Titles to Keywords feature for CommandPost ready (commissioned by Knut Hake) and it rendered my old workflow obsolet. Before, we would tag every Sync Clip in the Browser with keywords. Even with dedicated shortcuts and scripting it was not an easy task. If you made a mistake and had to go back one step you could loose orientation. Now, we can complete the entire process within a timeline and with titles and we can also adjust each step throughout the process.","As you can see below its as easy as:","Create a title with dedicated name (e.g. part 01)","Copy it over to the next take, adjust length, and so on","then you send it to Titles to Keywords and are presented with an Event, where all takes are thoroughly tagged with a keyword for every part , which you can then rename with more information, if needed.

This is small enough to have good orientation and, at the same time, not too many keywords, which also can be distracting. Depending on the length of the scene, we would have 5-9 keywords for our \"parts\"-system. The new process takes around than 20 minutes per scene, compared to the old approach, which could take up to 1 hour. The result is something like what's shown in the picture above: When you click on the keyword, which has parts of dialogue or a description of the moment in the name, you can quickly find the line you're looking for (circled in yellow). With the skimmer, it's a matter of milliseconds to play them in succession, select one, and exchange it with the take in the timeline.

I am a Producer-Director and Editor based in New Delhi, India. I collaborate on independent projects while also running my own creative production company called The Qurious Studio. I am the Editor on the Discovery+ India science documentary India’s Space Odyssey. It bagged the award for Best Current Affairs programme for a single Asian market at the Content Asia Awards.","I have used FCP X since its inception in 2011, while we were still working on FCP 7 and I have been a FCPX user ever since FCP 7. The transition from FCP 7 to FCPX was fairly smooth for me, however it was not the same story out there. For most editors the change was overwhelming, particularly the Producers and Production companies became extremely hesitant towards editing on FCPX. And with FCP7 dissolving, premiere occupied most of its space.","So, when I was asked to edit Space Odyssey, like a disclaimer, I had to tell them I edit on FCPX and if that is cool. Now, FCPX has to not just struggle with lack of information on it but also misinformation in the popular circle. I addressed few of their concerns holding my ground with confidence and then I believe they did not had much of a choice given the pandemic as well, so they gave it a nod.","India’s Space Odyssey is the story of the Indian Space Program that goes six decades back to as early as 1962 and before. That meant there was going to be a plethora of data to be managed, while we edit. A lot of which has to be archival footage, in all kinds of files and formats and the last thing to be shoot data. Like I remember the first batch of data, about 20 GB, sourced from NASA archives was eventually never used. All that clubbed with the data, Pria who produced and directed, and her team, shooting remotely in different parts of the world, would also come to my edit studio as they happen.","So I could anticipate much in advance that the core need on this project would be to have a robust data management within FCPX and outside as well. I took some time before the data could start coming in to do some homework on organising and structuring data, in order to follow a process that helps me when the project grows up to be complex. For this specific process demand, I could bring everything to work from keyword collections, smart collections to notes and metadata. Further I spoke to a few seniors but mostly wanted to peek into any pro editors process. Looking around YouTube, I feel most fcpx tuts/videos are often created in context to YouTube content only and there’s limited resources on YouTube for Pro editors. But I did find some help, one of the helpful videos I easily recall was from This Guy Edits, that helped look around the process of an editor to a Academy Nominated Doc. In conclusion, I think by end of project nothing else proved more crucial than doing that homework on organising and building a process to manage data because I never missed or struggled to find a file till the project finished.","Outside FCPX, I had used a drive cloning application to make an automated clone of the drive I was working on every few hours, since I was editing from my home studio and there were no RAID Storages.","Further, I had introduced Frame.io to the production team, since review and feedback were in question as I insisted on editing at my home studio and did not wanted to edit at a rental studio given my COVID-19 precautions/reservations. At the end Frame.io just didn’t turn out to be a saviour but it was so well received that it was further used by the production team on their other projects as well.","In terms of editing, I was editing on a 2017 27-inch iMac with 24GB RAM and an external monitor and I’ve never had a considerable hiccup with regards to FCPX’s performance and stability. It is one of those reasons that I had never left FCPX for, it is safe, stable and unbothering. Good organising, optimising legacy formats, keeping ample space in drives, managing volumes of render files, using Video-Audio roles from scratch, easy multicam syncing-editing and good old cutting were some key highlights to my workflow. Additionally, the documentary, perhaps due to budget constraints, was also colour corrected and graded in FCPX mostly using default tools. All in all, I could simply focus much more on the creative aspect of edit and lesser on the technical requirements once correctly setup. The FCPX workflow allowed me to have the headspace to discuss the edit creatively with my director and address creative concerns.","That said, there were still some genuine questions during the project, some answered and some had to be taken outside FCPX for help. Those addressed were like when exporting master the Discovery specification required a .mxf (OP1a) and I had to dig internet to learn and satisfy my director, that FCPX’s MXF export is by default wrapped in OP1a format. Others that did not find an answer were like the LKFS parameter, for which I could not find a solution within FCPX and I had to take my export file to Premiere Pro which had a LKFS meter.","Beyond performance and stability, I also use FCPX because I find the interface design much less intimidating and chaotic as compared to its contemporaries. The only complain is that there’s much less confidence in the industry on FCPX. And since I do not edit on any other NLE, I am turned down on many many more gigs compared to the numbers I am accepted on. Apple too seem to not take it with much seriousness as they do to their other products. Lately I have been looking towards Resolve to switch, if that ever happens."]},{"l":"Trailer"},{"l":"Promos"},{"l":"Poster"},{"l":"Screenshots"},{"l":"Discuss this page"}],[{"i":"blood--gold","l":"Blood & Gold","p":["Blood & Gold premiered on Netflix on Friday May 26th 2023.

As you saw with \"Blood Red Sky\", I can be persistent when it comes to material I really believe in.","This time we shot a lot outside, on real locations. That generally creates more of a mood and a better atmosphere. For our little town of Sonnenberg, we went to Vysluní in the former Sudetenland. The story we're telling could have actually happened there. There is a big neo-Romanesque church there in the center [...] this had been desecrated by the communist government, which gave us the opportunity to really shoot our showdown there. To shoot an homage to the Italo-Western with a shootout in a church has always been my dream. Accordingly, the church was the main reason why we chose Vysluní as the location.","Netflix was the gamechanger for me. They made two dream projects possible for me - both of which I had been trying in vain to get off the ground for more than ten years before that.","Excerpt from Blickpunkt:Film - Thomas Schultze 25.05.2023 12:48"]},{"l":"Quick Facts","p":["Netflix feature film (2022) - 95 minutes","47 shooting days near Prague, Czech Republic","185 VFX shots realised by Accenture Song VFX & Pixomondo","Edited on a MacBook Pro M1 Max and Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 in Berlin & Munich"]},{"l":"Workflow","p":["This workflow has been proven stable & reliable on 5 different Netflix productions & many more to date.","On previous shows we would mostly work remote from each other. With Blood & Gold we moved into a new studio in Berlin which made us reconsider a few key aspects of our workflow.","We've been using PostLab for a couple of years already and love the stress-free collaboration and its backup abilities. Working on large libraries requires a lot of up- and downloading which were constrained by our internet bandwidth. I setup a PostLab Local server on a M1 Mac mini which greatly reduced upload times (down to around 60 secs from previously 10-15 mins). The instructions to setup a Local server can be found in the Hedge documentation and we were able to set it up in 2 days without any prior knowledge of GitLab. For additional security we implemented Tailscale (Wireguard VPN) to restrict access to the server, which also allows us to access libraries remotely.","We considered a Jellyfish NAS for our media management, but couldn't justify the cost for our 2-person studio. PostLab Drive is a great tool for working remotely, but it still requires all media to be uploaded to their server. We were looking for a similar tool that would keep our media in sync which lead me to Syncthing. It allows you to sync directly over your local ethernet network, but also syncs peer-to-peer over WAN access. For additional security these connections are also running through Tailscale. This setup allows us to be very mobile and we solely work off OWC Envoy Pro SX 4TB drives which are super-fast and rugged. In addition we keep daily backups on two OWC ThunderBay Flex 8 drives.","Before shooting started we talked with our post-production supervisor, sound recordist, script supervisor, camera department and DIT on set to align our workflows.","We discuss editing codecs and naming of media files. We usually prefer ProRes 422 LT files because of the excellent quality to size ratio that is suitable for cinema screenings.","It is especially important to make sure they shoot with permanently synced timecode. For the sound files it is important to carry over the iXML information so that FCP can read the correct channel names.","With all of the above set we continue to setup our edit bays and our workflow down this project.","An in-depth version of our workflow can be found here: Final Cut Pro Workflow for feature films"]},{"l":"System Setup","p":["Post Haste allows you to save folder structures as a template.

Upload your FCP Library and everybody on your team can access it over the cloud. It also serves as a time-machine as you can revert to any uploaded iteration of your library. Starting with this production we moved to PostLab Local.","Lockit Network is a powerful script supervising tool that collects metadata on set which can be ingested into Final Cut Pro without the need to manually copy-paste important script notes.","Sync-N-Link is a tool to batch synchronize dual-system audio and video and to batch-create multicams. You can also use a target project to create synced clips in a different aspect ratio.","CommandPost is the Swiss Army Knife for Post Production Professionals.

Run with it\".","FCP is so fast that we spent more time focusing on the creative aspect of editing and not on the technical ones.","For sound turnovers, she used X2Pro to create AAFs, which our sound team praised.

And what ties it to ChatGPT? I will try to explain things in a simple and certainly inaccurate way, so those who understand a little about artificial intelligence, plug their ears...","Whisper is a transformer, and while Siri, Alexia, and Google try to understand the word or phrase that was spoken, Whisper goes a little bit wide and also tries to understand the context of each phoneme, and through a very broad knowledge base as well as statistical calculations, tries to make each word follow the word that makes the most sense, consistent with what is being spoken.","Whisper's wide model takes up a good 3GB, a little more in memory when it runs, but it is still to be considered a \"basic\" model, probably ChatGPT four is at least 100 times bigger - which is why it will be difficult to run something like this on our computers.","Rose-water technical details aside, this is one explanation of why Whisper is so much more accurate and also succeeds where other transcription systems stall: in the unfortunate event that it does not understand a word or part of a word, it \"reconstructs\" it from what comes before and what comes after.","Another major struggle was to \"teach\" (although perhaps the correct term would be to specify) Whisper to also generate punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, question marks, and escalation marks.","Pay attention to this: when you dictate to Siri you have to specify the punctuation mark you want to add.","Small color note: this very article is accomplished by dictating to Siri while I am moving between home and office by car.","One of the great peculiarities of Whisper is that it can also figure out what punctuation marks are, but this is not something it does automatically, you have to specify some input parameters so that it understands that the context has to include them as well."]},{"l":"Before the prototype","p":["In short, teased by the Twitter discussion and the endorsement, I started playing around with this system, trying to figure out what I could get out of it and what the limitations of the technology were.","I think I managed to make a very first prototype, with, of course, a horrible user interface within 7-10 days. And, of course, I started testing it with all the work I was doing in March 2023, projects of various kinds: from pharmaceutical video presentations to a video game trailer to some tutorials.","Here I encountered the first limitations of Whisper, which performs exceptionally well when the audio is quite clear, content with a speaker or interviews, while it goes deeply into crisis in case music or sound effects are present.","Initially, I told myself that this would not be a big problem, just specify in the requirements that the application was best suited for spoken content, nevertheless I felt the need to refine it, so I rolled up my sleeves and wondered if there was a possibility of parsing the audio in such a way as to find the points where there was speech and then eliminate those where there was only music or sound effects.","I succeeded by taking advantage of some libraries provided by Apple for analyzing sounds. Subsequently, one thing I have been working on in parallel with both this app and the one that does text-to-speech is the highlighting of sentences in sync with the video (or, rather, with the audio).","I always thought that when doing a speech review, physically, the people in charge have in front of them a sheet, printed in Courier font, with all the features of the script. For this very reason I wanted the words and sentences to be written in this same style, not so much for skeuomorphism, but because it is still the most effective and efficient method of reading the text while listening to the related audio.","I worked not a little in such a way as to continuously highlight the line of text that is \"spoken\" at a particular moment in time.","When there is information that varies over time, the concept of a timeline is one of the strongest: it transforms the horizontal axis into that of time, so the playhead moves from left to right as the playback continues.","Showing in a two-dimensional screen information that evolves over time is never a trivial matter, not least because it involves making user interfaces and real-time interaction methods, which in some ways have more to do with video games than with video writing programs...","This is why I am particularly proud of this part of the code; not only is the segment highlighted with the sentence being spoken, but it is also easy to interact with it by correcting any transcription errors.","It sounds like a breeze, but believe me, it's not!"]},{"l":"3GB of passion","p":["Another big problem stemmed from the fact that the model I wanted to use, again in open source and with respect to legality, takes up a good 3GB, as I mentioned earlier.","Downloading a 3GB application, as annoying as it may seem, is not that problematic, for the installation to begin with.","But then I thought about all the times there would be a need for an upgrade, and downloading 3 GB of stuff, most of it always the same, would be particularly troublesome, especially in areas of the world where connection speeds are not comparable to those of the big European or North American metropolises.","So I set to work on making a system that would allow the downloading of the template only the first time, and among other things in \"shared\" mode, so that in case I wanted to develop another application based on the same technology, it could safely use the model already downloaded (spoiler: thing I have actually already done with FCP Video Tag)."]},{"l":"The field test","p":["\"Of course yes!\", I replied, and the fact that I had a real use case, with tight deadlines and a not inconsiderable qualitative demand, led me to work heavily on the application, so as to improve as much as possible the interface and also the possibility of exporting the subtitles in different formats, including text with total transcription, unsynchronized, and later also RTF with time code indication in a different style.","And it was during the interviews that it was asked if it was possible to have even a rough transcript of what was being said for medical and scientific review.","And since Transcriber's purpose is to extract the subtitles from the audio, I thought, more or less simply, to add precisely the subtitle overlay to the video, so the eyes are all and always in the same area of the screen.","At the end of April I had to go to Florence to attend a medical conference and do several interviews with many doctors, in a total of 12 languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, and Brazilian Portuguese.","I patted myself on the back because this stuff, in the end, among the transcription applications, I guess I only had it...","I told myself that there had to be a way to \"split\" a subtitle while still keeping the text in sync with the video.","In practice, the traditional transcription process, which involved typing the texts while continuing to pause the video, translates into an automatic process of \"raw\" transcription, which must necessarily be followed by a (much faster) checking phase.","In the end I decided that, as an option enabled by default, the system tries to figure out whether the user has pressed the ENTER button to wrap, and when it is pressed, the split sentence automatically generates two subtitles that are fairly synchronized to the video, where \"fairly\" means \"more or less imperceptibly.\"","Just by making these doctor interview videos, I told myself that by keeping the video played at the top of the interface separate with the transcribed text at the bottom, the user's attention would be focused on only one of the two.","Just looking at the overlay subtitles, I realized that although I had struggled not a little to try to get Whisper to digest the punctuation marks, in some cases the sentences were so long that they would result in huge subtitles that would take up too much of the screen.","Let me be clear: I have always considered Transcriber as a semi-automatic tool, this means that the transcription should still be reviewed a human being.","The boundary conditions are simple: artificial intelligences are very fast, very efficient and also very effective, but they don't understand what they are doing; it's just data to them. It's up to us to maintain control.","This also sounds like a no-brainer, but it's not, not least because the system, during playback, continuously updates itself (about 30 times per second) to try to figure out where it is, among all the phrases being spoken which one is active at that instant of time, and then highlights it at the bottom and shows the text content superimposed on the video.","This has led to better fluidity in handling the interface and the ability to interact very easily and very quickly on the text stream.","This is the philosophy of all the apps I make: automate as much as possible, while still leaving control, verification and, not least, responsibility to a flesh-and-blood guy.","You see, my applications are born and grow in a fairly almost \"autistic\" way, but then it is really with user testing (and also when I make tutorials) that I discover the limitations and areas where they can be improved."]},{"l":"Text Editor","p":["One of the features of Transcriber that I like best is the text editor, the subtitle editor.","From a purely technical and data structure point of view, each of the scripts corresponds to a different record in the document's \"internal database,\" called the Session.","When working with text, however, for example with Microsoft Word or Pages, what appears in the sheet is a single text that can be edited easily.","I did a lot of work so that text editing would be as similar as possible to that of a traditional word processor, while still allowing for the ability to manage how the texts remain \"attached\" (i.e., synchronized) to the video.","The whole component of transcription, and managing the synchronized texts, was one of the most complex but at the same time also quite elegant things I have ever done.","I tried to make things as simple as possible and as intuitive as possible for the user, while going out of my way to mask any complexities.","If a title is too long, it is highlighted with a red dot which means that, given its length, it would take up too much space in the frame.","The user then has the option of standing anywhere in the text and pressing the ENTER button to wrap, and by wrapping, in a natural way, the subtitle is broken into two different titles while still keeping all the words in sync.","Said like that sounds like a piece of cake, but believe me, this is something non-trivial! And this is also how I have operated with regard to the separation of subtitles while they are being transcribed and generated: trying to isolate sentences or sentence segments (separated by commas, \",\") as much as possible, so that we always have meaningful content to display, without truncated sentences or with subjects being in one subtitle and verbs being in another subtitle."]},{"i":"i-got-a-publisher","l":"I got a publisher!","p":["At the end of 2022 I was contacted by the guys at FxFactory because they were interested in publishing some of my apps on their store, on their marketplace.","This filled me with joy, pride, and also with fear: for the first time I would be playing in the big leagues, and I would have to maintain much higher quality standards; this time I would not be doing everything myself, but I would also have to be accountable to someone else for my work.","Initially we had planned to bring a couple of my most popular apps, such as BeatMark Pro or FCP Diet 2, to this marketplace, adding features and cleaning up the interface.","I, however, proposed that they start with a completely new app, whose name initially was Transcriptor.","I initially met some resistance, partly because such apps already existed, such as the aforementioned Macwhisper.","I then explained the reasons why this new app of mine could be something alternative and provide added and different value than the others.","In concomitance with NAB, where several apps that make use of artificial intelligence to aid production and post production were presented or announced, those in charge of FxFactory were convinced and switched on the green light.","One thing needs to be emphasized: FxFactory is not only a store, a showcase, but those who run it put their faces first and consequently require a level of quality, communication, and even user experience that is far superior to what I had had up to that point.","If I had commercialized Transcriber all by myself, it would probably have come out in some form of its own in late April or early May 2023.","Instead, FxFactory raised my bar higher and higher, trying to reach heights of communication, user interface, functionality, and overall quality level that I was not used to.","And, I have to be honest, I don't think I can thank them enough for making me grow, and making me grow so fast."]},{"l":"Exporting to Final Cut Pro","p":["Initially Transcriber was not supposed to allow exporting subtitles to Final Cut Pro because I already have an application in my catalog that does just that, FCP SRT Importer 2, by the way one of my most successful applications (which means that the gentlemen at Apple and whoever is in charge of managing Final Cut Pro development should ask themselves some questions if so many people need such a basic feature...).","Let's say I didn't want to cannibalize myself, even though I knew Transcriber would be a higher cost application, there would probably be enough of a market for one to buy Transcriber bundled with FCP SRT Importer 2.","But then, again for that Florence job, I realized that the double step: transcribing the subtitles, revising, exporting the subtitles to SRT format, then bringing them back into FCP SRT Importer 2, and finally communicating the whole thing with Final Cut Pro, was really... a big pain in the ass!","In the end I had all the technology, the know-how, why not add this feature to Transcriber as well?","And so I did, in the span of only one day I added all the features that were already in FCP SRT Importer 2 directly inside Transcriber.","It has to be said that, having chosen to make the UI in SwiftUI, creating configuration panels was never very complex, and one could focus more on business logic than on appearance and user interaction.","In short, the app was taking shape the decidedly concrete way."]},{"l":"Multiple SRTs","p":["The work of doctors in Florence has evolved over time, and the client also asked me for the ability to view interviews, but with subtitles translated into various languages.","Nothing could be simpler: after doing the transcription and export in SRT format, I proceeded to have these subtitles translated; and then imported into FCP SRT Importer 2 to make the localized videos in the various languages.","This, however, resulted in a decidedly disrupted workflow where I could not actually see the effect of the translated subtitles without first exporting them, or making a peer comparison between each individual sentence from the original to the translated version.","So it is, in a moment of madness (Alex, for next time, remember not to do this kind of thing again with a product that has not yet been released!) I expanded the underlying model, the data structure, to allow multiple subtitle imports.","Basically now Transcriber allows you to have infinite streams of subtitles, in various languages, and also to show side by side the original and translated sentence.","It may sound like a triviality, but this is really a very powerful feature, especially for those working with \"minor\" languages, for which localization, translation, export, and management of different streams is an integral part of the production and post production process.","Basically, with all this work done under the hood, I had transformed Transcriber from an application that deals with a single link in the localization management chain, into an aggregation center that allows for a global and centralized view of projects, always in synchronization between text and video.","Oh boy, this stuff was getting serious!"]},{"l":"The Dome Factory","p":["In the meantime, we got to the beginning of June 2023, I kept asking to get the application launched, but the publisher kept asking me for more and more refinements and better management of the interface.","They were certainly right, but the timing of these final cleanups and subsequent approval left me with an open project, and every time I used it, which happens pretty much every day, I would come up with little features to add.","As a result, what should have been a \"Minumum Viable Product\" was becoming an increasingly complex application, and of course with the need to handle any bugs I would generate by adding new code."]},{"i":"videos-videos-videos","l":"Videos, videos, videos!","p":["Since I had started to develop a system for synthetic speech of more or less \"sufficient\" quality, I decided to change the way I make promotional videos and this time use a synthetic speaker.","This might be a more or less debatable choice, I am the first to fear very much the \"uncanny valley\" effect, but I believe that the quality level of synthetic voices has reached such a level that, in any case, at least from my point of view, it is preferable to a promotional video made with only overlay text.","So here I made my first promo video.","And, because the application is definitely complex, some things may even seem intuitive, but to understand how the workflow works in my opinion you need to sit down for a moment and understand a little bit what is the best way to operate, I decided to also make some tutorials of increasing complexity, making use of both screen captures and animations made with Adobe After Effects, which is the program I use most in my first job as a video maker.","This time I tried to maintain a distinctly high level of quality, not only in the promo but also for all the side videos, it was a really big effort, maybe it might not look like it, however trying to show things in a quick, effective, clear, understandable way without becoming pompous, is not a child's play...","Find all the videos I made for Transcriber here.","And, in addition, one important thing there is to say: every time I set out to make a tutorial, therefore trying to do things the way any user would do them, I find a lot of mistakes or things that can be improved, so to make a video of a few minutes, it can take me even several days because, in the meantime, I am working on the code and improving the interface or adding features."]},{"l":"The run-up before the jump","p":["By early July 2023, the application had reached a level of stability that FxFactory said was sufficient to be marketed.","I was then asked to create artwork and a minimum description for marketing, as well as a promotional video.","All things I had already prepared, however, small problem: in the promotional video I had made I had used an image taken from a very famous movie.","Nothing you can't see anyway in any kind of promotional material from this same movie, however, the publisher politely asked me to replace it with something else so as to avoid any copyright issues.","Datum done, in one day I revamped the promotional video and made all the art work.","I was basically ready to go."]},{"l":"The Launch","p":["The launch was set for July 6, 2023, I received the news in the early afternoon, and on that day, I remember it was a Thursday, I was playing with my son and listening to some music.","I was so excited by the news that I started dancing, making my son jump up and down.","It was a scene somewhere between tender and ridiculous...","At 9:30pm, Italian time, the application was launched, and I noticed because I got the first email notification of successful transaction.","I was finally able to post news of the launch on Twitter with the link to be able to download the app in trial mode (for the record: in the trial version it allows you to transcribe the first 45 seconds of the movie or import subtitles for the first 45 seconds).","I spent months raising expectations about this app on Twitter, to the point where I had probably lost some credibility as well: I felt I was ready to launch in late April, early May, and then instead it was a full two months later...","Was it worth the wait?","From the end users' point of view I don't know, from my point of view?","Heck, yes!","This was the craziest launch ever since I started having this small software development business.","Having a publisher like FxFactory behind me, I achieved in two weeks what I set out to achieve in two years!","This does not mean that I have become rich, this does not mean that the pressure has eased, and after the initial explosion, the values settle down to a more or less quiet regime.","And the first week, but perhaps also the second week, were weeks of great work on my part to improve the things that were missing, add the features that were requested, as well as fix some idiosyncrasies and bugs: I had never been able to test the application with complex languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and I found that syntactic construction and more or less \"special\" characters needed to be handled more accurately.","Let's say that I haven't slept, or slept very little, for about two weeks now..."]},{"i":"and-now","l":"And now?","p":["Now, that this app is in the world, since it is in the hands of so many people, I have discovered so many use cases and workflows that I had not thought about.","My task now, my commitment, is to satisfy as much as possible the requests of most users, going in and filling in any holes or things I had not thought of.","The first weeks, the first months after launch are characterized by a flood of new ideas and suggestions, many of which can be accepted and turned into new features, some of which cannot, because they would meet the needs of too few users or would be difficult to implement...","No app is perfect, no app is complete, software is increasingly something that is constantly evolving and transforming.","Very often I look back and think that many of the programs I have built over the years came about because Apple had not put some functionalities, even very basic ones, directly inside Final Cut Pro.","I have slipped into this \"niche\" by trying to find a way to speed up workflows and get users (but myself first and foremost) to focus on the more creative stages of the post production process, using the tools I create as if they were novice interns: young people who need to learn and need to be supervised, but who can contribute by doing boring, repetitive, even easy work with little added creative value.","In the meantime, I'm working on at least two or three other new apps that I'd like to bring to market, tools that can help video makers who do everything themselves speed up their work.","Well, the story, for now, stops here, but we can have a chat directly with the comments to this article, below, or follow me on Twitter, I am quite active and respond

When you develop an application, your project links to one or more frameworks. For example, iPhone application projects link by default to the Foundation, UIKit, and Core Graphics frameworks. Your code accesses the capabilities of a framework through the application programming interface (API), which is published by the framework through its header files. Because the library is dynamically shared, multiple applications can access the framework code and resources simultaneously. The system loads the code and resources of a framework into memory, as needed, and shares the one copy of a resource among all applications."]},{"l":"History Lesson","p":["Phil Pan writes on Alex4D's Facebook Page:","I worked on that team for five years. There wasn't much work done on merging Shake and FCP. Most of the advanced work done by the core Shake team focused on the Helium renderer, which today is core to Pro Apps today. Shake's genius was how it was ultra-efficient as CPU-only code. Management had little interest in Shake and most resources went to Motion and Aperture; projects that Steve could related to when he wasn't completely absorbed by the iPad, the iPhone and the iTunes business ecosystem. The author of this patent, Christophe Souchard, is a French mathematician who had tons of prior experience at Discreet/Autodesk. He joined Apple when it purchased his Senso technology, which was the first Intel-based library to do advanced image scaling and frame-rate conversion using motion vector estimation. While at Apple, Christophe's skills impressed management enough that his position was labelled \"Applied Magic\", and a veteran aerospace software engineer was hired to perform curation and clerical code management for his inventions. He introduced the team to methods using partial differential equations and while exteremely slow to compute, his next-generation prototypes performed jaw-dropping feats 15 years before similar tools would be introduced by Adobe. None of this work ever came out because Apple had a policy not to release compute-intensive software. Randy Ubillos (father of FCP and close to Steve) wouldn't accept any operation that took longer than a second per frame to render. This relegated Christophe to a research position for a while, until Randy got so impressed that he monopolized Christophe to work on advanced concepts for FCPX. Randy had some clever ideas about shot alignment and automatic editing, and this patent is the result of one of their collaborative projects. Today Christophe works at Unity Technologies doing advanced AR work, and he consults on the side when he has the time. He's recently rumored to have authored the rendering engine for ColorSynth, a complex colour grading plugin for FCPX and Premiere.","Helium was done in Santa Monica by the mad frenchmen team at Apple; Arnaud Hervas, Emmanuel Mogenet and Chrisophe Souchard. Arnaud was the co-founder of Nothing Real, the company that produced Shake. The idea was to do automatic tiled rendering using all available compute resources, so CPU cores and GPU(s). It was a lot trickier than people would think, as math functions would be rounded differently on different resources, and this would affect pixel values. The renderer has to evaluate the render graph to intelligently tile the proper regions-of-interest; i.e. it has to know the size of convolution kernels and all parts of a shader to produce tiles that will later merge properly, and it has to do all of this in real-time. Beautiful work. Emmanuel is now an executive at Google Research in Switzerland. Arnaud is growing tomatoes in Culver City, when he's not working on camera alignement software. Apple could have done a lot more in the high end, but in the last days of Steve, the company shifted its focus on the mass market and mobile devices. It was the right thing to do for all the reasons we know today (the Bottom Line being the most evident), but in so doing it hurt engineering effors in high-end imaging across the world; Adobe was going through a bad patch and the Discreet team at Autodesk was in disarray. The high-end was picked up by The Foundry: Its founder, Bruno Nicoletti (a Discreet alumnus) had the clever idea to acquire Nuke from Digital Domain and he had the skills and industry knowledge to turn it into the work-horse that it's become today. Still, Nuke is a geek's tool and there could have been an opportunity for a more artist-oriented solution in the high-end. This would not be one of Apple's pursuits: After a couple of years of soul-searching it became clear in 2007 that the future of Apple would be the iPhone and that all the Pro Apps stuff was no longer interesting. It survived nonetheless and I'd say that today the spirit of high(ish) end imaging is coming back to Apple. But so is the case at Adobe. In the end, the consumer wins and it's an exciting time to be buying graphics solutions."]},{"l":"Plugins","p":["Internally, Final Cut Pro supports and contains a number of different plugin types and formats:"]},{"l":"Compressor","p":["Contains CompressorKit.bundle- which can also be found in Compressor and Motion - it's basically the Compressor engine."]},{"l":"FCP-DAL","p":["Contains ACD.plugin- a CoreMediaIO plugin that enables the \"A/V Output\" feature in Final Cut Pro.","The CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) is analogous to CoreAudio’s Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

More than 13 years old now (at the time of writing), Core Data was introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and iOS with iPhone SDK 3.0 and like many parts of macOS, Core Data owes much of its design to an earlier NeXT product, Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF).","You can watch the original 2004 WWDC session on Core Data here.","You can read Apple's official developer documentation on Core Data here.","Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in an application. It provides generalised and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management, including persistence (meaning that, for example, an iPhone App can remember its settings each time the phone is turned off and on again).","It allows data organised by the relational entity–attribute model to be serialised into XML, binary, or SQLite stores. The data can be manipulated using higher level objects representing entities and their relationships. Core Data manages the serialised version.","Core Data can interface directly with SQLite, insulating the developer from the underlying SQL - but it's not a SQL wrapper, and offers a much higher level of abstraction. Instead of writing SQL, you can create complex queries by associating an NSPredicate object with a fetch request. However, because Core Data can use SQLite, it's easy to get confused with the differences between SQLite and Core Data. Remember that Core Data isn’t a database. If you want an Object-relational mapping (O/RM) or SQL wrapper, Core Data is not what you want.","Essentially, Core Data is a model layer technology, that's been designed to help programmers do lots of cool stuff, whilst writing less code. It's a toolkit that allows developers to more easily access and manipulate data. For example, it has built-in undo/redo management, allowing developers to add complex undo/redo functionality to their applications with minimum code.","Even though Core Data is a fantastic framework, there are several drawbacks. These drawbacks are directly related to the nature of the framework and how it works.","Core Data can only do its magic because it keeps the object graph it manages in memory. This means that it can only operate on records once they’re in memory. This is very different from performing a SQL query on a database. If you want to delete thousands of records, Core Data first needs to load each record into memory. It goes without saying that this results in memory and performance issues if done incorrectly.","Another important limitation is the threading model of Core Data.

You want your friends to check it over, make sure it fits with everything else, and then add it in when they agree it's ready. This way, you ensure that everyone's work meshes well together and the project doesn't become a mess.","A GitHub pull request is basically the same idea. When you're working on a shared codebase, or \"project,\" you often work on your own copy, or \"branch\". When you think your changes are ready to be added to the shared codebase, you make a \"pull request\". This is a proposal that says \"I think these changes I made should be added to our shared project\".","Your teammates then can look over your changes, suggest edits, and finally, if they agree that your changes are good, they \"merge\" them into the shared project. This way, everyone keeps the code clean and organized, and you have a record of who added what and when.","So, in simple terms, a pull request is a way of proposing changes to a shared project and allowing others to review and approve those changes before they're added."]},{"l":"Navigating GitHub","p":["For example, each time you make a pull request, our fancy GitHub Action does the following:","However, to make sure the website is super easy to update and improve, we use GitHub Actions to \"do stuff\" to our markdown files whenever we submit a pull request.","Looks at all the individual Asset Management in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Asset Management page.","Looks at all the individual Camera Formats in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Camera Formats page.","Looks at all the individual FAQ in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the FAQ page.","Looks at all the individual FxPlug in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the FxPlug page.","Looks at all the individual Motion Templates in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Motion Templates page.","Looks at all the individual News item in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Latest News page.","Looks at all the individual Plugins in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Plugins page.","Looks at all the individual Sponsors in this folder, and uses them on the Latest News page.","Looks at all the individual Tools & Frameworks in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Tools & Frameworks page.","Looks at all the individual Tools in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Tools page.","Looks at all the individual Workflow Extensions in this folder, and generates an alphabetical list of them for the Workflow Extensions page.","Looks at all the Latest News items and generates an RSS feed","This means, if you want to add a Tool, Motion Template, Workflow Extension, News item, etc. you can just add a new markdown file in that folder, and once the pull request is approved, everything will be updated automagically.","To create the fastest website possible, FCP Cafe is what's called a \"static site\".
